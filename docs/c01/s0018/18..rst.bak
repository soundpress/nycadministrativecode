Section 18. ::    
        
     
        § 18. Office of immigrant affairs. a. The city recognizes that a large
      percentage  of  its  inhabitants were born abroad or are the children of
      parents who were born abroad and that the well-being and safety  of  the
      city  is  put  in jeopardy if the people of the city do not seek medical
      treatment for illnesses that may be contagious, do  not  cooperate  with
      the  police when they witness a crime or do not avail themselves of city
      services to educate themselves  and  their  children.  It  is  therefore
      desirable  that the city promote the utilization of city services by all
      its residents, including foreign-born inhabitants, speakers  of  foreign
      languages and undocumented aliens.
        b.  In  furtherance  of  the  policies stated in subdivision a of this
      section, there shall be established in the executive office of the mayor
      an office of  immigrant  affairs.  The  office  shall  be  headed  by  a
      director,  who  shall  be  appointed  by  the mayor. The director of the
      office of immigrant affairs shall have the power and the duty to:
        1. advise and assist the mayor  and  the  council  in  developing  and
      implementing   policies   designed   to   assist  immigrants  and  other
      foreign-language speakers in the city;
        2. enhance the  accessibility  of  city  services  to  immigrants  and
      foreign-language speakers by establishing programs to inform and educate
      immigrant and foreign language speakers of such services;
        3.   manage  a  citywide  list  of  translators  and  interpreters  to
      facilitate communication between  city  agencies  and  foreign  language
      speakers;
        4.   perform  policy  analysis  and  make  recommendations  concerning
      immigrant affairs; and
        5. perform such other duties and functions as may  be  appropriate  to
      pursue the policies set forth in subdivision a of this section.
        c.  Any  service  provided by a city agency shall be made available to
      all aliens who are otherwise eligible  for  such  service  to  the  same
      extent  such service is made available to citizens unless such agency is
      required by law to deny eligibility for such service to aliens.
