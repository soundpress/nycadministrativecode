Section 19. ::    
        
     
        §  19.  Office  to  combat  domestic violence. a. The city of New York
      recognizes  that  domestic  violence  is  a  public  health  issue  that
      threatens  hundreds  of  thousands  of  households  each  year  and that
      respects  no  boundaries  of  race,  ethnicity,  age,   gender,   sexual
      orientation  or economic status. The city of New York further recognizes
      that  the  problems  posed  by  domestic  violence   fall   within   the
      jurisdiction  and  programs  of  various  City  agencies  and  that  the
      development of  an  integrated  approach  to  the  problem  of  domestic
      violence,  which  coordinates existing services and systems, is critical
      to the success of the city of New York's efforts in this area.
        b. There shall be, in the executive office of the mayor, an office  to
      combat  domestic violence. The office shall be headed by a director, who
      shall be appointed by the mayor.
        c. The director of the office to combat domestic violence  shall  have
      the power and duty to:
        1. coordinate domestic violence services;
        2. formulate policies and programs relating to all aspects of services
      and protocols for victims of domestic violence;
        3. develop methods to improve the coordination of systems and services
      for domestic violence;
        4.  develop  and  maintain  mechanisms to improve the response of city
      agencies to domestic violence situations and improve coordination  among
      such agencies; and
        5.  implement  public  education  campaigns  to  heighten awareness of
      domestic violence and its effects on  society  and  perform  such  other
      functions as may be appropriate regarding the problems posed by domestic
      violence.
        d. 1. For purposes of this subdivision, the following terms shall have
      the following meanings:
        (i)  "Agency"  shall  mean  a  city, county, borough, or other office,
      position,  administration,  department,  division,  bureau,   board   or
      commission,  or  a corporation, institution or agency of government, the
      expenses of which are paid in whole or in part from the city treasury.
        (ii) "Domestic violence fatality" shall mean a death of  a  family  or
      household member, resulting from an act or acts of violence committed by
      another family or household member, not including acts of self-defense.
        (iii)   "Family   or   household  member"  shall  mean  the  following
      individuals:
        (a) persons related by consanguinity or affinity;

        (c) persons formerly married to one another regardless of whether they

        (e)  persons  not  legally married, but currently living together in a
      family-type relationship; and
        (f) persons not legally married, but who have formerly lived  together
      in a family-type relationship.
        Such term, as described in (e) and (f) of this subparagraph, therefore

      in-laws.
        (iv)  "Perpetrator"  shall  mean  a  family  or  household  member who

      fatality.
        (v)  "Victim"  shall  mean  a  family  or household member whose death
      constitutes a domestic violence fatality.
    
        2. There shall be a domestic violence  fatality  review  committee  to

      in the city of New York. Such committee  shall  develop  recommendations
      for  the  consideration of the director of the office to combat domestic
      violence  regarding  the  coordination  and  improvement of services for
      victims  of  domestic  violence  provided  by   agencies   and   private
      organizations  that provide such services pursuant to a contract with an
      agency. The committee shall be convened by the director of the office to
      combat domestic violence, or his or her designee, and shall  consist  of

      any of the offices of the district attorney of any of the five  boroughs
      and/or  a  representative  of  the New York city housing authority. Each

      capacity shall be appointed by the mayor.
        (i)  The  service  of each member other than a member serving in an ex
      officio capacity shall be for a term of two  years  to  commence  ninety
      days  after  the  effective  date  of  the  local  law  that  added this
      subdivision. Any vacancy occurring other  than  by  expiration  of  term
      shall be filled by the mayor in the same manner as the original position
      was  filled.  A  person  filling  such  a  vacancy  shall  serve for the
      unexpired portion of the term of the member succeeded. New  terms  shall
      begin on the next day after the expiration date of the preceding term.
        (ii) Members of the committee shall serve without compensation.
        (iii)  No  person  shall be ineligible for membership on the committee
      because such person holds any other public office, employment or  trust,
      nor  shall  any  person  be  made ineligible to or forfeit such person's
      right to any public office,  employment  or  trust  by  reason  of  such
      appointment.
        (iv) The committee shall meet at least four times a year.
        3.  The  committee's  work  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to,
      reviewing statistical data relating  to  domestic  violence  fatalities;
      analyzing   aggregate   information   relating   to   domestic  violence
      fatalities, including, non-identifying data with respect to victims  and
      perpetrators  involved  in domestic violence fatalities, such as gender,
      age,  race  and  familial  or  other  relationship  involved,  and,   if
      available,  religion,  ethnicity  and  employment  status; examining any
      factors indicating a  high-risk  of  involvement  in  domestic  violence
      fatalities;  and  developing  recommendations  for  the  director of the
      mayor's office to combat domestic violence  regarding  the  coordination
      and improvement of services for victims of domestic violence provided by
      agencies  and  private organizations that provide such services pursuant
      to a contract with an agency.
        4. The committee may request and receive information from  any  agency
      as  may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision, in
      accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,  including,  but
    
      not limited to, the exceptions to disclosure of agency records contained
      in  the  public  officers  law.  Nothing  in  this  subdivision shall be
      construed as limiting any right or obligation of  agencies  pursuant  to
      the  public  officers  law,  including  the  exceptions to disclosure of
      agency records contained in such law,  with  respect  to  access  to  or
      disclosure  of  records  or  portions  thereof.  The  committee may also
      request from any private organization  providing  services  to  domestic
      violence  victims  pursuant  to  a  contract  with an agency information
      necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision. To the extent
      provided by  law,  the  committee  shall  protect  the  privacy  of  all
      individuals   involved  in  any  domestic  violence  fatality  that  the
      committee may receive information on in carrying out the  provisions  of
      this subdivision.
        5.  The  committee shall submit to the mayor and to the speaker of the
      city council, on an annual basis, a report including,  but  not  limited

      violence fatality cases reviewed by the committee  during  the  previous
      year,  if  any;  any  non-identifying  data  with respect to victims and

      age,   race  and  familial  or  other  relationship  involved,  and,  if
      available,  religion,  ethnicity  and  employment  status;  any  factors
      indicating  a  high risk of involvement in domestic violence fatalities;
      and  recommendations  regarding  the  coordination  and  improvement  of
      services  for  victims  of  domestic  violence  provided by agencies and
      private organizations that provide such services pursuant to a  contract
      with an agency.
