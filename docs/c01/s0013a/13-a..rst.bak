        §  13-a.  Code  of  administrative judicial conduct. The mayor and the
      chief administrative law judge of the office  of  administrative  trials
      and hearings shall jointly promulgate, and may from time to time jointly
      amend,  rules  establishing  a  code  or  codes  of professional conduct
      governing the activities of all administrative law  judges  and  hearing
      officers  in city tribunals, except to the extent that such promulgation
      would be inconsistent with law. Prior to promulgating  or  amending  any
      such  rules,  the  mayor  and  the  chief administrative law judge shall
      consult with the  conflicts  of  interest  board,  the  commissioner  of
      investigation  and affected agency and administrative tribunal heads. An
      administrative law judge or hearing officer shall be subject to  removal
      or other disciplinary action for violating such rules in the manner that
      such  administrative  law  judge  or  hearing  officer may be removed or
      otherwise disciplined under law.  Further,  such  rules  may  set  forth
      additional  sanctions  or  penalties for violations of such rules to the
      extent consistent with law.
