Section 16. ::    
        
     
        §  16.  Report  on social indicators. The mayor shall submit an annual
      report  to  the  council,  borough  presidents,  and  community   boards
      analyzing  the social, economic and environmental health of the city and
      proposing strategies for addressing the issues raised in such  analysis.
      The  report  shall  present and analyze data on the social, economic and
      environmental  conditions  which  are  significantly  related   to   the
      jurisdiction  of  the agencies responsible for the services specified in
      section twenty seven hundred four, the health and hospitals corporation,
      and such other agencies as the mayor shall from time  to  time  specify.
      The report shall include the generally accepted indices of unemployment,
      poverty,  child welfare, housing quality, homelessness, health, physical
      environment, crime, and such other indices as the mayor shall require by
      executive order or the council shall require by local law.  Such  report
      shall  be submitted no later than sixty days before the community boards
      are required to submit budget priorities pursuant to section two hundred
      thirty and shall contain: (1) the reasonably available statistical data,
      for the current and previous five years, on such conditions in the  city
      and,  where possible, in its subdivisions; and a comparison of this data
      with such relevant national, regional or other standards or averages  as
      the   mayor  deems  appropriate;  (2)  a  narrative  discussion  of  the
      differences in such conditions among the subdivisions of the city and of
      the changes over time in such conditions; and (3) the mayor's short  and
      long  term plans, organized by agency or by issue, for responding to the
      significant problems evidenced by the data presented in the report.
