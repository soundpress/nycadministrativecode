Section 8. ::    
        
     
        §  8.  General  powers.  The  mayor,  subject  to  this charter, shall
      exercise all the powers vested in the city, except as otherwise provided
      by law.
        a. The mayor shall be responsible for the effectiveness and  integrity
      of  city  government  operations  and  shall establish and maintain such
      policies and procedures as are necessary and appropriate  to  accomplish
      this responsibility including the implementation of effective systems of
      internal  control  by each agency and unit under the jurisdiction of the
      mayor.
        b. The mayor shall be a magistrate.
        c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the  mayor  shall  have
      the  powers  of  a  finance  board  under  the local finance law and may
      exercise such powers without regard to any provision of law  prescribing
      the  voting strength required for a resolution or action of such finance
      board, provided,  however,  that  whenever  the  mayor  determines  that
      obligations  should  be  issued and the amount thereof, he shall certify
      such determination to the comptroller who shall thereupon determine  the
      nature  and  term of such obligations and shall arrange for the issuance
      thereof.
        d. The mayor shall establish  a  minimum  per  diem  compensation  for
      inspectors  of  election and clerks employed to assist the inspectors of
      election in polling places under the direction of the board of elections
      as follows: on registration and primary election days twenty dollars; on
      Election day thirty-five dollars,  except  that  the  chairman  of  each
      election  board  shall  receive an additional three dollars compensation
      per day. The  minimum  per  diem  rate  for  compensation  for  election
      inspectors attending classes of instruction shall be five dollars.
        e. The mayor shall establish a professional internal audit function in
      the  executive  office  of  the mayor which is sufficient to provide the
      mayor with such information and assurances as the mayor,  as  the  chief
      executive  of  the city, requires to ensure the proper administration of
      the city's affairs and the efficient conduct of its business.
        f. Except as otherwise provided in section eleven, the mayor  may,  by
      executive  order,  at  any time, create or abolish bureaus, divisions or
      positions within the executive office of the mayor as he or she may deem
      necessary to fulfill mayoral duties. The mayor may from time to time  by
      executive order, delegate to or withdraw from any member of said office,
      specified  functions, powers and duties, except the mayor's power to act
      on local laws or resolutions of the council, to act as a  magistrate  or
      to appoint or remove officials. Every such order shall be filed with the
      city  clerk  who  shall  forward  them  forthwith to the City Record for
      publication.
        g. The city has the power to determine the duties  of  its  employees,
      and  it  is  essential  to the workings of city government that the city
      retain control over information obtained by city employees in the course
      of their duties. In the exercise of this power, the mayor may promulgate
      rules requiring that information obtained  by  city  employees  be  kept
      confidential   to   the  extent  necessary  to  preserve  the  trust  of
      individuals who have business with city  agencies.  To  the  extent  set
      forth  in such rules, each agency shall, to the fullest extent permitted
      by the laws of the United States and the state of New York, maintain the
      confidentiality  of  information  in  its  possession  relating  to  the
      immigration  status or other private information that was provided by an
      individual to a city employee in the course of such employee's duties.
