Section 11. ::    
        
     
        §  11.  Reorganization of agencies under jurisdiction of mayor. a. The
      agencies existing on the effective date of this  section  are  continued
      except  as otherwise provided in the charter or as otherwise provided by
      state or local law enacted since that date or by any  actions  taken  by
      the mayor pursuant to this section since that date. To achieve effective
      and  efficient  functioning and management of city government, the mayor
      may organize or reorganize any agency under his jurisdiction,  including
      the  authority  to transfer functions from one agency to another; create
      new agencies; eliminate existing  agencies;  and  consolidate  or  merge
      agencies.  Any action by the mayor pursuant to this subdivision shall be
      termed a   "reorganization plan" and shall  be  published  in  the  City
      Record.
        b.  In  preparing  reorganization plans, the mayor shall eliminate, as
      appropriate, agencies or functions which duplicate  or  overlap  similar
      agencies of, or functions performed by, other agencies of city, state or
      local government.
        c.  If  any  proposed  reorganization  plan  involves  a  change  of a
      provision of this charter, except as provided pursuant to subdivision  f
      of  this  section,  or  local  law  now in effect, or otherwise involves
      reorganization of an agency created pursuant  to  a  resolution  of  the
      board  of  estimate  or  executive  order  of  the  mayor, a copy of the
      reorganization plan first shall be submitted to the council.   Within  a
      period  of ninety days from the date of receipt, the council may adopt a
      resolution that approves or disapproves the reorganization plan. In  the
      event  the  council  takes  no  action within the ninety-day period, the
      reorganization plan shall be deemed approved as if the council had taken
      affirmative action, and is then effective.
        d. The text of a reorganization plan approved pursuant to  subdivision
      c of this section shall appear as a part of the administrative code.
        e. The mayor may withdraw or modify a reorganization plan submitted to
      the council before any final action by the council with respect to it.
        f. The authority of the mayor pursuant to this section shall not apply
      (1)  to  any  matter  which  would otherwise require the submission of a
      local  law  for  the  approval  of  the  electors  pursuant  to  section
      thirty-seven,  or (2) to any board or commission established pursuant to
      a provision of this charter.
