        § 1171.  Board of collective bargaining.  There shall be in the office
      of  collective  bargaining a board of collective bargaining, which shall
      consist of seven members.   Two members  of  the  board  shall  be  city
      members,  two  members  of  the  board shall be labor members, and three
      members of the board, of whom one shall be chairman, shall be  impartial
      members.   The mayor shall have the power to appoint the city members of
      the board to serve at his pleasure, and the labor members of  the  board
      from designations by the municipal labor committee.  Each labor and city
      member  shall  have  an alternate, who shall be appointed and removed in
      the same manner as the member  for  whom  he  is  the  alternate.    The
      chairman  and  other impartial members shall be elected by the unanimous
      vote of the city and labor members,  and  shall  serve  for  three  year
      terms,  provided,  that  of  the  impartial  members  first elected, the
      chairman shall serve for  a  term  ending  on  January  first,  nineteen
      hundred  seventy,  one  member  shall serve for a term ending on January
      first nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and one member shall serve for a term
      ending on January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight.
        Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a labor member may not  be
      removed  from  the  board  except  upon  request  of the municipal labor
      committee, or except for cause, as hereinafter provided.  Any member may
      be removed for cause by a majority of the  entire  board,  including  at
      least  one  city  member and one labor member, after having been given a
      copy of the charges against him and an opportunity to be heard in person
      or by counsel in his defense  upon  not  less  than  ten  days'  notice.
      Vacancies  in  the  office  of  a city member or a labor member shall be
      filled in the same manner as herein provided for appointment.  Vacancies
      in the office  of  an  impartial  member  occurring  otherwise  than  by
      expiration  of  term  shall  be filled by unanimous vote of the city and
      labor members for the unexpired balance of the term.
