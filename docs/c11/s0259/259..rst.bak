        §  259.  Independent  budget  office. a. There shall be an independent
      budget office to be headed by a director who shall be appointed upon the
      recommendation of the independent budget office  advisory  board,  by  a
      special  committee  convened  for  this  purpose.  Such  committee shall
      consist of the comptroller, the public  advocate,  a  borough  president
      chosen  by  the  borough  presidents, and a council member chosen by the
      council, and shall act by majority vote. The director shall be appointed
      without regard to political affiliation  and  solely  on  the  basis  of
      fitness  to  perform  the  duties  assigned by this chapter. The term of
      office of the director first appointed shall expire on August first, two
      thousand, and the terms of office of  directors  subsequently  appointed
      shall expire on such date in each fourth year thereafter. Any individual
      appointed  to  fill  a  vacancy  prior to the expiration of a term shall
      serve only for the unexpired portion of the term. An individual  serving
      as  director  at  the expiration of a term may continue to serve until a
      successor is appointed.
        b. The appropriations  available  to  pay  for  the  expenses  of  the
      independent budget office during each fiscal year shall not be less than
      ten  percentum  of the  appropriations available to pay for the expenses
      of the office of management and budget during such  fiscal  year.    The
      director  shall  appoint such personnel and procure the services of such
      experts and consultants, within the appropriations  available  therefor,
      as  may  be  necessary  for  the  director  to  carry out the duties and
      functions assigned herein.   Such personnel and  experts  shall  perform
      such duties as may be assigned to them by the director.
        c.  The director shall be authorized to secure such information, data,
      estimates and statistics from the agencies of the city as  the  director
      determines  to  be  necessary  for  the performance of the functions and
      duties of the office, and such agencies shall provide such  information,
      to  the  extent that it is available, in a timely fashion.  The director
      shall not be entitled to obtain  records  which  are  protected  by  the
      privileges  for  attorney-client  communications, attorney work product,
      and material prepared for litigation.
        d. There shall be an  independent  budget  office  advisory  committee
      consisting  of  ten members appointed jointly by the comptroller and the

      to  consecutive  terms. Vacancies occurring because of the expiration of
      terms shall be filled promptly on the recommendation of the  members  of
      the   committee  whose  terms  are  not  expiring.  Vacancies  occurring

      numbered year elect, from among its members, a chair and vice-chair  who
