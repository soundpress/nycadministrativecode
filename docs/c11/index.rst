The mayor may, after due consideration, authorize payment of such claim, and such claim shall thereupon be paid in such amount as the mayor shall determine to be just, in full statisfaction* thereof, provided that the claimant or his or her estate, shall execute and deliver a release upon receipt of such payment, in such form as shall be approved by the corporation counsel. The allowance in payment of such claim shall be without any interest whatsoever.






*§ 12-105 Heads of agencies; power to make deductions from salaries of subordinates.* ::

3. In his or her discretion, to suspend for not more than one month without pay, any subordinate pending the hearing and determination of charges against such subordinate, or the making of any explanation, as the case may be.

a. The head of any agency, upon written application by any person who has been dismissed from service, setting forth the reasons for demanding an opportunity of making a further explanation, shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to rehear the explanation and any new matter offered in further reply to the charges or complaint upon which such person was dismissed from service. Such person shall be required to waive, in writing, all claims against the city for back pay. Such application for another opportunity to explain shall only be presented to and granted by the officer who made the removal or such officer's immediate successor, when the applicant for the further explanation shall make it appear, by affidavit:

   1. That on a further opportunity to explain, he or she can produce such evidence as would probably have changed the decision if it had been presented theretofore; and

   2. If such evidence has been discovered since the previous explanation, that it is not cumulative; and

   3. That the failure to produce it at the first explanation was not owing to want of diligence.

b. If upon the further explanation, the head of such agency shall determine that such person has been illegally or unjustly dismissed, the head of such agency may, in his or her discretion, and with the approval in writing of the commissioner of citywide administrative services, cause such person to be reinstated.

c. The consent of the mayor shall be required when reinstatement of an applicant is made by the immediate successor of the removing official. It shall be unlawful, however, for the immediate successor of the removing official to reinstate an applicant who has been removed for more than two years.

The amounts received as overtime compensation pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be regarded as salary or compensation for the purposes of any pension or retirement system of which the employee receiving such overtime compensation is a member. Such overtime compensation shall not be regarded as salary or compensation for the purpose of determining the right to any increase of salary or any salary increment on account of length of service or otherwise, nor shall the payment of such overtime compensation be construed to constitute a promotion.






*§ 12-109 Activities of mayor and other officers of the city or of any agency as officers or members of an educational corporation chartered by the board of regents of the University of the state of New York to carry out programs to encourage scholastic achievement by pupils within the city.* ::

The availability of forms for public inspection pursuant to this subdivision is subject to the following provisions:

   1. Privacy, safety and security requests.

      (a) Any person required to file a report pursuant to this section may, at the time the report is filed or at any time thereafter, except when a request for inspection is pending, submit a request to the conflicts of interest board, in such form as the board shall require, to withhold any item disclosed therein from public inspection on the ground that the inspection of such item by the public would constitute an unwarranted invasion of his or her privacy or a risk to the safety or security of any person. Such request shall be in writing and shall be in such form as the conflicts of interest board shall prescribe and shall set forth the reason such person believes the item should not be disclosed. During the time for evaluation of such a request, such report shall not be available for public inspection.

      (b) The conflicts of interest board shall evaluate such request and any such item shall be withheld from public inspection upon a finding by the board that the inspection of such item by the public would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy or a risk to the safety or security of any person. In making this determination, the board shall consider the following factors:

         (1) whether the item is of a highly personal nature;

         (2) whether the item in any way relates to the duties of the positions held by such person, including whether there are security or safety issues relating to such duties;

         (3) whether the disclosure poses a risk to the security or safety of the reporting person or any other individual;

         (4) whether the item involves an actual or potential conflict of interest.

      (c) The conflicts of interest board shall provide a written notification of the board's determination to the person who requested that information be withheld from public inspection and shall not release the information subject to the request until at least ten days after mailing of the notification. Such notification shall advise the person of his or her right to seek review of such determination by the supreme court of the state of New York and that the conflicts of interest board will not release the information subject to the request until ten days after the mailing of the notification.

      (d) Any information regarding any financial interests of the spouse, domestic partner or an unemancipated child of a person filing in which the person filing has no financial interest shall be withheld from public inspection, except the information disclosed pursuant to subparagraph (p) of paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, as an unwarranted invasion of privacy unless the conflicts of interest board determines that such information involves an actual or potential conflict of interest on the part of the person filing, subject to the factors set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of this subdivision.

      (e) Whether or not a person required to file a report pursuant to this section has submitted a request for privacy, the conflicts of interest board may upon its own initiative grant privacy as to any information contained in such person's report upon a finding by the board that the release of such information would constitute a risk to the safety or security of any person.

      (f) Where a person required to file a report pursuant to this section files an amendment to a previously submitted report, both the original submission and the amendment shall be available for public inspection, subject to the provisions of this subdivision.

      (g) The conflicts of interest board shall establish procedures governing the withholding of information on the ground of privacy. Such procedures shall include provision for the person who filed the information to appear in person to set forth, or submit a written statement setting forth, the reasons why the information should be withheld from public inspection.

   2. Requests to examine reports. Whenever pursuant to this section the conflicts of interest board produces a report for public inspection, the board shall notify the person who filed the report of the production and of the identity of the person to whom such report was produced, except that no such notification shall be required if the report is made available for public inspection on the board's website without written request or if the request to examine the report is made by the department of investigation or any governmental unit, or component thereof, which performs as one of its principal functions any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, provided that such report is requested solely for a law enforcement function. Nothing in this section shall preclude the conflicts of interest board from disclosing any and all information in an annual disclosure report to the department of investigation or any other governmental unit, or component thereof, which performs as one of its principal functions any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws, provided that such report is requested solely for a law enforcement function.

f. Retention of reports. Reports filed pursuant to this section shall be retained by the conflicts of interest board for a period of two years following the termination of the public employment or service of the person who filed the report. In the case of candidates for office who have filed reports pursuant to this section and who were not elected, the reports shall be retained by the board for a period of two years following the day of an election on which the candidates were defeated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the board, in consultation with the department of records and information services and the department of investigation, may establish by rule a different period or periods of retention of annual disclosure reports which takes into account the need for efficient records management and the need to retain such reports for a reasonable period for investigatory and other purposes. Such reports shall thereafter be destroyed by the board unless a request for public disclosure of an item contained in such report is pending. In lieu of the destruction of such reports, the board, in its discretion, may establish procedures providing for their return to the persons who filed them.

g. Penalties.

   1. Any person required to file a report pursuant to this section who has not so filed at the end of one week after the date required for filing shall be subject to a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars or more than ten thousand dollars. Factors to be considered by the conflicts of interest board in determining the amount of the fine shall include but not be limited to the person's failure in prior years to file a report in a timely manner, and the length of the delay in filing. In addition, within two months after the date required for filing, the conflicts of interest board shall inform the appropriate agency and the commissioner of investigation of the failure to file of any such person.

   2. Any intentional violation of the provisions of this section, including but not limited to failure to file, failure to include assets or liabilities, and misstatement of assets or liabilities, shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than one year or by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars, or by both, and shall constitute grounds for imposition of disciplinary penalties, including removal from office in the manner provided by law. In addition, any intentional violation of the provisions of this section may subject the person reporting to assessment by the conflicts of interest board of a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed ten thousand dollars.

*§ 12-311 Bargaining notice; mediation; impasse panels.* ::


a. Bargaining notices. 

   (1) At such time prior to the expiration of a collective bargaining agreement as may be specified therein (or, if no such time is specified, at least ninety but not more than one hundred fifty days prior to expiration of the agreement) a public employer, or a certified or designated employee organization, which desires to negotiate on matters within the scope of bargaining shall send the other party (with a copy to the director) a notice of the desire to negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement on such matters. The parties shall commence negotiations within ten days after receipt of such a bargaining notice, unless such time is extended by agreement of the parties, or by the director or the board of collective bargaining.

   (2) At any time after a public employee organization has been newly certified or designated to represent the public employees in a designated bargaining unit, the public employer or the newly certified or designated employee organization, if it desires to negotiate on matters within the scope of collective bargaining, may send the other party (with a copy to the director) a bargaining notice for the terms of a collective bargaining agreement on such matters. The parties shall commence negotiations within ten days after receipt of such a bargaining notice, unless such time is extended by agreement of the parties, or by the director or the board of collective bargaining.

   (3) Nothing herein shall authorize or require collective bargaining between parties to a collective bargaining agreement during the term thereof, except that such parties may engage in collective bargaining during such term on a matter within the scope of collective bargaining where (a) the matter was not specifically covered by the agreement or raised as an issue during the negotiations out of which such agreements arose and (b) there shall have arisen a significant change in circumstances with respect to such matter, which could not reasonably have been anticipated by both parties at the time of the execution of such agreement.

b. Mediation panels. 

   (1) The office of collective bargaining shall maintain a register of mediators who have been approved for listing thereon by the board of collective bargaining.

   (2) If the director, upon the request of a party or upon his or her own initiative determines that collective bargaining negotiations between a public employer and a certified or designated employee organization would be aided by mediation, he or she shall appoint a mediation panel from such register to assist the parties in arriving at an agreement. A mediation panel shall not be appointed less than thirty days after the commencement of negotiations, unless requested by both parties. It shall be the duty of the parties to cooperate with the mediation panel to arrive at an agreement.

   (3) The mediation panel shall perform its duties under the general direction and guidance of the director, to whom it shall report.

c. Impasse panels. 

   (1) The office of collective bargaining shall maintain a register of impasse panel members who have been approved for listing thereon by a majority of the entire board of collective bargaining, including at least one city member and one labor member.

   (2) If the board of collective bargaining, upon recommendation of the director, determines that collective bargaining negotiations (with or without mediation) between a public employer and a certified or designated employee organization have been exhausted, and that the conditions are appropriate for the creation of an impasse panel, it shall promptly instruct the director to appoint such a panel. The director may also appoint an impasse panel upon request of both parties. In appointing a panel, the director shall submit to the parties a single list of seven persons from the register of impasse panel members, and each party shall inform the director of its preferences. To the extent the preferences disclose agreement, the person or persons agreed upon shall be appointed to the impasse panel; to the extent the preferences are not in agreement, the director shall proceed to designate the members of such panel from the register. Each party may at its own expense designate a consultant to an impasse panel, who shall be available to the panel for assistance.

   (3) (a) An impasse panel shall have power to mediate, hold hearings, compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, review data, and take whatever action it considers necessary to resolve the impasse. If an impasse panel is unable to resolve an impasse within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the director, it shall, within such period of time as the director prescribes, render a written report containing findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations for terms of settlement.

      (b) An impasse panel appointed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision c shall consider wherever relevant the following standards in making its recommendations for terms of settlement:

         (i) comparison of the wages, hours, fringe benefits, conditions and characteristics of employment of the public employees involved in the impasse proceeding with the wages, hours, fringe benefits, conditions and characteristics of employment of other employees performing similar work and other employees generally in public or private employment in New York city or comparable communities;

         (ii) the overall compensation paid to the employees involved in the impasse proceeding, including direct wage compensation, overtime and premium pay, vacations, holidays and other excused time, insurance, pensions, medical and hospitalization benefits, food and apparel furnished, and all other benefits received;

         (iii) changes in the average consumer prices for goods and services, commonly known as the cost of living;

         (iv) the interest and welfare of the public;

         (v) such other factors as are normally and customarily considered in the determination of wages, hours, fringe benefits, and other working conditions in collective bargaining or in impasse panel proceedings.

      (c) The report of an impasse panel shall be confined to matters within the scope of collective bargaining. Unless the mayor agrees otherwise, an impasse panel shall make no report concerning the basic salary and increment structure and pay plan rules of the city's career and salary plan. If an impasse panel makes a recommendation on a matter which requires implementation by a body, agency or official which is not a party to the negotiations: (i) it shall address such recommendation solely to such other body, agency or official; (ii) it shall not recommend or direct that the municipal agency or other public employer which is party to the negotiations shall support such recommendation; and (iii) it may recommend whether a collective bargaining agreement should be concluded prior to such implementation. Any alternative recommendations proposed by an impasse panel in the event such implementation does not occur shall not exceed the total cost of the original recommendations.

      (d) The report of an impasse panel shall be submitted to the parties to the negotiations, to any other body, agency or official whose action is required to implement the panel's recommendations, and to the director. The director shall, with the advice and guidance of the board of collective bargaining, determine the time at which such report shall be released to the public, which shall not be later than seven days after its submission or, upon agreement of the parties and approval of the director, not later than thirty days after its submission, provided that if the parties conclude a collective bargaining agreement prior to the date on which the report is to be released, the report shall not be released except upon consent of the parties.

      (e) Acceptance or rejection. Within ten days after submission of the panel's report and recommendations, or such additional time not exceeding thirty days as the director may permit, each party shall notify the other party and the director, in writing, of its acceptance or rejection of the panel's recommendations. Failure to so notify shall be deemed acceptance of the recommendations. The director may release the acceptance or rejections to the public at such time as the director, in his or her discretion, may deem advisable. Upon acceptance by all parties or ten days after the latest rejection by any party, unless an appeal is earlier filed with the board pursuant to subparagraph (a) of paragraph four of this subdivision, the recommendation shall become final and binding and shall constitute an award within the meaning of article seventy-five of the civil practice law and rules, provided, however, that any provisions of such award the implementation of which requires the enactment of a law shall not become binding until the appropriate legislative body enacts such law.

   (4) Review of impasse panel recommendations:

      (a) A party who rejects in whole or in part the recommendation of an impasse panel as provided in subparagraph (e) of paragraph three of this subdivision may appeal to the board of collective bargaining for review of the recommendations of the impasse panel by filing a notice of appeal with said board within ten days of such rejection. The notice of appeal shall also be served upon the other parties within said time. Upon failure to appeal within the time provided herein, the recommendations shall be final and binding upon the party failing to so appeal, as provided in subparagraph (e) of paragraph three of this subdivision, except that the board, upon its own initiative, may review recommendations which have been rejected. Panel recommendations which, pursuant to the provisions of this subparagraph, become final and binding on both parties shall constitute an award within the meaning of article seventy-five of the civil practice law and rules, provided, however, that any provision of such award the implementation of which requires the enactment of a law shall not become binding until the appropriate legislative body enacts such law.

      (b) The notice of appeal shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is taken, the alleged errors of the panel, and the modifications requested. The board shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to argue orally before it or to submit briefs, or may permit both argument and briefs. Review of the recommendations shall be based upon the record and evidence made and produced before the impasse panel and the standards set forth in subparagraph (b) of paragraph three of this subdivision and shall include consideration of issues, if any, of conformity of the recommendations with any law or regulation properly governing the conduct of collective bargaining between the city of New York and its employees, provided, however, that when an appeal is taken to the board on any of the grounds of prejudice set forth in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section seventy-five hundred eleven of the civil practice law and rules, review shall also be based upon the record made in any hearing which the board may direct on such issues, provided, however, that the board orders such hearing within thirty days of the filing of the notice of appeal.

      (c) Upon such review, the board may affirm or modify the panel recommendations in whole or in part. A modification of the recommendations shall be by the vote of a majority of the board. The board may also set aside the recommendations of an impasse panel in whole or in part if it finds that the rights of a party have been prejudiced on any of the grounds set forth in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of paragraph one of subdivision b of section seventy-five hundred eleven of the civil practice law and rules. An order setting aside a recommendation of such grounds shall be based on a written decision and shall be made upon a vote of a majority of the board. A member of the board who has acted as a member of an impasse panel shall not be disqualified from subsequently participating in a decision or determination of the board in the same dispute.

      (d) The recommendations of the impasse panel shall be deemed to have been adopted by the board if the board fails to issue a final determination within thirty days of filing of the notice of appeal, or within forty days of a notification of rejection to the director of the board where the board, upon its own initiative, reviews the panel's recommendations, provided, however, that when a hearing is ordered pursuant to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph four relating to allegations of prejudice, the impasse panel's recommendations shall be deemed to have been adopted by the board only if the board fails to issue a determination thereon within thirty days after the close of such hearing, and provided further, that the director may extend the thirty day or forty day periods mentioned in this subparagraph for an additional period not to exceed thirty days.

      (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph four, and except for purposes of judicial review, any provision of a determination of the board of collective bargaining the implementation of which requires the enactment of a law shall not become binding until the appropriate legislative body enacts such law.

      (f) A final determination of the board pursuant either to subparagraph (c) or (d) of this paragraph four shall be binding upon the parties. Such a final determination shall constitute an award within the meaning of article seventy-five of the civil practice law and rules.

d. Preservation of status quo. During the period of negotiations between a public employer and a public employee organization concerning a collective bargaining agreement, and, if an impasse panel is appointed during the period commencing on the date on which such panel is appointed and ending sixty days thereafter or thirty days after the panel submits its report, whichever is sooner, provided, however, that upon motion of the panel, and for good cause shown, the board of collective bargaining may allow a maximum of two sixty-day extensions of time for the completion of impasse panel proceedings, provided further, that additional extensions of time for the completion of impasse panel proceedings may be granted by the panel upon the joint request of the parties, and during the pendency of any appeal to the board of collective bargaining pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the public employee organization party to the negotiations, and the public employees it represents, shall not induce or engage in any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, or mass absenteeism, nor shall such public employee organization induce any mass resignations, and the public employer shall refrain from unilateral changes in wages, hours, or working conditions. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit the rights of public employers other than their right to make such unilateral changes, or the rights and duties of public employees and employee organizations under state law. For the purpose of this subdivision the term "period of negotiations" shall mean the period commencing on the date on which a bargaining notice is filed and ending on the date on which a collective bargaining agreement is concluded or an impasse panel is appointed.

e. Number of members on panels; vote required. 

   (1) Mediation and impasse panels shall consist of such odd number of persons (one or more) as may be agreed upon by the parties to the negotiations, or, in the absence of such agreement, as shall be deemed appropriate by the director.

   (2) All actions, determinations, findings and recommendations of an impasse panel shall be by majority vote.

f. Anything in this chapter notwithstanding, public employers and certified or designated employee organizations hereby are empowered to enter into written agreements setting forth procedures to be invoked in the event of an impasse in collective bargaining negotiations, and such agreements may include the undertaking by each party to submit unresolved issues to impartial arbitration, provided that (1) if the agreement between the parties fails to provide procedures which result in a final determination of all issues, then all unresolved issues between the parties shall be subject to the provisions of subdivision c of this section or so much thereof as may be applicable under the circumstances, and (2) questions, issues or disputes as to arbitrability or the scope of collective bargaining shall be determined by the board of collective bargaining only.






*§ 12-312 Grievance procedure and impartial arbitration.* ::


a. The board of collective bargaining shall maintain a register of arbitrators who have been approved for listing thereon by a majority of the entire board of collective bargaining including at least one city member and one labor member. The board of collective bargaining shall establish procedures for impartial arbitration which may be incorporated into executive orders and collective bargaining agreements between public employers and public employee organizations.

b. Executive orders, and collective bargaining agreements between public employers and public employee organizations, may contain provisions for grievance procedures, in steps terminating with impartial arbitration of unresolved grievances. Such provisions may provide that the arbitrator's award shall be final and binding and enforceable in any appropriate tribunal in accordance with the applicable law governing arbitration, except that awards as to grievances concerning assignment of employees to duties substantially different from those stated in their job classifications, or the use of open-competitive rather than promotional examinations, shall be final and binding and enforceable only to the extent permitted by law.

c. Arbitrators appointed under arbitration provisions relating to municipal agencies shall be persons on the register of the board of collective bargaining. The costs of such arbitration shall be determined and allocated pursuant to section eleven hundred seventy-four of the charter. The board of collective bargaining, in its discretion, may publish arbitration awards.

d. As a condition to the right of a municipal employee organization to invoke impartial arbitration under such provisions, the grievant or grievants and such organization shall be required to file with the director a written waiver of the right, if any, of said grievant or grievants and said organization to submit the contractual dispute being alleged under a collective bargaining agreement to any other administrative or judicial tribunal except for the purpose of enforcing the arbitrator's award. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit the rights of any public employee or public employee organization to submit any statutory or other claims to the appropriate administrative or judicial tribunal.

e. Public employees and public employee organizations shall not induce or engage in any strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages, or mass absenteeism nor shall public employee organizations induce any mass resignations during the term of a collective bargaining agreement. A provision to that effect shall be inserted in all written collective bargaining agreements between public employers and public employee organizations. This subdivision shall not be construed to limit the rights of public employers or the duties of public employees and employee organizations under state law.

f. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city that written collective bargaining agreements with certified or designated employee organizations should contain provisions for grievance procedures and impartial binding arbitration, which may be invoked by a public employer or by a certified or designated employee organization.

g. An employee may present his or her own grievance either personally or through an appropriate representative, provided that:

   (1) a grievance relating to a matter referred to in paragraph two, three or five of subdivision a of section 12-307 of this chapter may be presented and processed only by the employee or by the appropriate designated representative or its designee, but only the appropriate designated representative or its designee shall have the right to invoke and utilize the arbitration procedure provided by executive order or in the collective agreement to which the designated representative is a party; and provided further that

   (2) any other grievance of an employee in a unit for which an employee organization is the certified collective bargaining representative may be presented and processed only by, the employee or by the certified employee organization, but only the certified employee organization shall have the right to invoke and utilize the arbitration procedure provided by executive order or in the collective agreement to which the certified representative is a party.






*§ 12-313 Membership and rules of municipal labor committee.* ::


Membership in the municipal labor committee shall be open to any certified employee organization as defined in this chapter and which is otherwise eligible for membership under the rules of such committee. The board of collective bargaining may, upon the request of any certified employee organization, abrogate any rule of such committee relating to voting or eligibility for membership which it determines to be arbitrary or discriminatory, provided that prior to any such abrogation such committee shall be given an opportunity on at least ten days' notice to be heard thereon.






*§ 12-314 Special provisions relating to initial certification.* ::


a. Any employee organization which (1) discriminates with regard to the terms and conditions of membership because of race, color, creed, religion, disability, gender, sexual orientation, age, or national origin, or (2) is engaged in or advocates the violent overthrow of the government of the United States or of any state or any political subdivision thereof shall be ineligible for certification as an exclusive bargaining representative. For purposes of this section, the finding of a court or an administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction that an employee organization has engaged in discrimination upon one of the above bases in a particular case shall not be dispositive of the question of that employee organization's eligibility for certification unless it is also found that the employee organization has engaged in a pattern or practice of such discrimination generally.

b. No organization seeking or claiming to represent members of the police force of the police department shall be certified if such organization (i) admits to membership, or is affiliated directly or indirectly with an organization which admits to membership, employees other than members of the police force of the police department, or (ii) advocates the right to strike.

c. Certificates or designations issued by the department of labor prior to the effective date of this chapter and in effect on such date shall remain in effect until terminated by the board of certification pursuant to its rules. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall limit the power of the board of certification to determine bargaining units differing from those determined by the department of labor.






*§ 12-315 Delegation of powers.* ::


The director, with the approval of at least five other members of the board of collective bargaining, may delegate to independent and impartial private institutions those functions of the office of collective bargaining relating to (a) the maintenance of registers of mediators, arbitrators, and members of impasse panels, (b) the submission of the names of persons on the impasse panel and arbitration registers for selection by parties to negotiations or to a grievance, and (c) the conduct of representation and decertification elections.






*§ 12-316 Emergency suspension of salary and wages.* ::


a. It is hereby found and declared that a fiscal emergency exists for the city of New York by reason of the following: As a result of the severe economic and social dislocations of recent years, there has been a great increase in the need and demand for public services at a time when financing such services has become increasingly difficult. Due to a general decline in investor acceptance of local government securities and almost unprecedented high interest rates, the city of New York, despite the financial soundness of its obligations, recently has faced increased difficulty in selling a sufficient amount of its securities to enable it to refund its outstanding obligations or to meet its cash requirements. For the immediate future, this increased difficulty has caused concern that it may be unable to provide, without interruption, many services essential to its inhabitants while also meeting obligations to the holders of its outstanding securities as they come due. It is in the public interest and it is the policy of the city of New York to provide, without interruption, services essential to its inhabitants while meeting its obligations to the holders of its outstanding securities. The state of New York, in an attempt to assist the city of New York and other municipalities faced by a similar or analogous problem has enacted chapter one hundred sixty-eight and one hundred sixty-nine of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-five, which among other provisions create a municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York, empowering it to issue bonds and notes and to use the proceeds from their sale primarily to provide the city of New York with amounts to pay the short-term obligations of the city as they mature. Despite statutory provisions which, in effect, secure the bonds and notes issued by the municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York with all the proceeds of the state stock transfer tax and of the state municipal assistance sales and compensating use taxes to the extent needed for that purpose, despite the agreement of the city of New York to make and observe such changes in its record keeping, accounting, budgeting and financial management practices as the municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York requires pursuant to such legislation and despite numerous economy measures taken by the city of New York, including a substantial reduction in the number of its employees, the municipal assistance corporation for the city of New York has been experiencing difficulty in selling the bonds it has issued and has expressed grave concern with regard to its ability to sell bonds which it plans to issue in the near future. The city of New York, as a result, is faced by a fiscal emergency which could seriously impair its ability to carry on orderly and uninterrupted operations and functions of government. Imposing certain additional nuisance taxes which the state in the past had given it power to impose is not a feasible solution since to do so may further impair the city's credit standing because the burden of present taxes has contributed to flight from the city of middleclass taxpaying residents and of a number of business firms. In view of this situation, it is necessary for the city to exercise its sovereign police power to suspend salary increases in the manner provided in subdivision b of this section.

b. The mayor shall have the power to direct by executive order that all or any part of increases in salary or wages of public employees which have taken effect since June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five or which will take effect after that date pursuant to collective bargaining agreements or other analogous contracts requiring such salary increases as of July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five or as of any date thereafter shall be suspended. All or any part of increased payments for holiday and vacation differentials, shift differentials, salary adjustments according to plan and step-ups or increments which have taken effect since June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-five or which will take effect after that date pursuant to collective bargaining agreements or other analogous contracts requiring such increased payment, as of July first, nineteen hundred seventy-five or as of any date thereafter may, in the same manner, be suspended. For the purposes of computing the pension base of retirement allowances, the suspended salary or wage increases and the suspended other payment shall not be considered as part of compensation or final compensation or of annual salary earned or earnable. The suspensions provided herein shall be effective for the first pay period ending on or subsequent to September first, nineteen hundred seventy-five and shall continue until one year thereafter.

c. This section shall not be applicable to public employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement or a public employee not covered by a collective bargaining agreement where the collective bargaining representative or such unrepresented employee, by an instrument in writing, has agreed to a deferment of salary or wage increase which has been certified by the mayor as being an acceptable and appropriate contribution toward alleviating the city's fiscal crisis. The mayor may, if he or she finds that the fiscal crisis has been alleviated or for any other appropriate reason, direct by executive order that the suspensions of salary or wage increases or suspension of other increased payments shall, in whole or in part, be terminated.

d. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 12-304 of this chapter, this section shall be applicable to all public employees, including public employees of any public employer as defined in this chapter.
