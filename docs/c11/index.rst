      chosen  by  the  borough  presidents, and a council member chosen by the

      duties of the office, and such agencies shall provide such  information,
      to  the  extent that it is available, in a timely fashion.  The director
      shall not be entitled to obtain  records  which  are  protected  by  the
      privileges  for  attorney-client  communications, attorney work product,
      and material prepared for litigation.
        d. There shall be an  independent  budget  office  advisory  committee
