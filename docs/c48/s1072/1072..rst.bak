        1.  Permitted  and  approved street closures that do not allow for the
      passage of vehicular traffic on that street, including but  not  limited
      to  closures for special events, crane operations and other construction
      work, film shoots and paving operations; and
        2. Parking regulations. The information related to  paragraph  (1)  of

      borough, except that street closures for crane operations,  construction
      work  and paving operations shall have the notation "subject to closure"
      during times where closure has been permitted  and  approved  but  where
      such  closure  may or may not occur on a particular day. All information
      required by this subdivision shall be available on the city's website as
      soon as practicable but in no case less than one week prior to any  such
      closure  or  change,  except  closures which were applied for or planned
      less than one week prior to any such closure or change, which  shall  be
      available on such interactive map within seventy-two hours of the permit
      and  approval  of  such  closure.  Where a permitted and approved street
      closure is due to a  special  event,  the  sponsor  of  the  event  with
      appropriate  contact  information  shall  be  provided  as  part of such
      interactive map. For the purposes of  this  subdivision,  special  event
      shall  mean  any  street  fair,  block  party  or  festival  on a public
      street(s) where such activity may interfere with or obstruct the  normal
      use by vehicular traffic of such street(s); and
        r.  to  provide  to the public, at no charge on the city's website, an
      interactive crime map that, for each segment of a street bounded by  one
      or  more  intersections  and/or  a  terminus, shall visually display the
      aggregate monthly, yearly and year-to-date totals for  the  current  and
      the  most  recent  prior  calendar years for each class of crime that is
      reported to the New York city police department, or for which an  arrest
      was  made,  including crimes that occurred in parks and subway stations.
      Such map shall be searchable by address, zip code, and patrol  precinct.
      All  information  required by this subdivision shall be available on the
      city's website as soon as practicable but in no case more than one month
      after a crime complaint has been filed. The mayor shall ensure that  all
      agencies  provide the department with such assistance and information as
      the department requires to compile and update the interactive crime map.
