Such board shall enter in its minutes such facts and proofs as it may receive and its proceedings on such hearing, and any other proof it may take; and thereafter may rescind, modify or reaffirm its declaration and order, and require execution of the original, or of a new or modified order to be made in such form and effect as it may finally determine.






*§ 17-147 Execution.* ::


If such order is not complied with, or so far complied with as the board may regard as reasonable, within five days after service or attempted service or within any shorter time, which, in case of imminent peril to the public health, the board may have designated, or is not thereafter speedily and fully executed, then such order may be executed as any of the orders of the board or department. Any agency of the city is authorized to act as agent of the department in executing such order. In the event that any agency shall so act, it shall certify and transmit to the department its expenses in the execution of such order separately in respect of each separately owned parcel of property. Such expenses shall be reimbursed to such agency and shall be chargeable and collectible as expenses of the department in connection with the execution of an order as referred to in this chapter.






*§ 17-148 Substituted service; posting; service by publication.* ::


a. If personal service of any such order cannot be made by reason of absence from the district, or inability to find one or more of the owners, occupants, lessees or tenants of the subject matter to which such order relates, or one or more of the persons whose duty it was to have done what is therein required to be done, as the case may render just and proper in the opinion of the board, to be shown by the official certificates of the officer having such order to serve, then service may be made through the mail, or by copy left at the residence or place of business of the person sought to be served, with a person of suitable age and discretion.

b. In any case where personal service of any such order cannot be made for the reasons stated in subdivision a of this section and service cannot be made as provided in such subdivision through the mail or by leaving a copy with a person of suitable age and discretion, because of inability to obtain the name or address of the person sought to be served, and such inability to effect service is shown by the official certificate of the officer having such order to serve, service may be made by conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property to which it relates. The posting of such order shall be sufficient notice of such order and of the nuisance therein mentioned to all persons having any duty or liability in relation thereto under the provisions of this chapter.

c. Whenever the board shall have declared any condition, matter or thing to be a nuisance, including ragweed or any other species of weed, plant or growth, and has entered the same in its records as a nuisance, the board may also take and file among its records what it shall regard as sufficient proof to authorize a declaration that such nuisance is widespread throughout the city or in any area thereof, and that personal service or service pursuant to subdivision a or b of this section of an order or orders requiring the abatement, removal or correction of such nuisance would result in delay prejudicial to the public health, welfare or safety, and upon the filing of such proof and the making of such declaration, the board may order that such nuisance be removed, abated or corrected, as prescribed by the board, by an order addressed generally, without specification of names or addresses, to all persons who, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, have any duty or liability in relation to any such nuisance which may exist upon or in any real or personal property or place located within the area or areas specified in such order. Such order may be served by publishing the same for a period of not less than three days in the City Record and in a newspaper circulated in the area or areas mentioned in such order. Service of such order shall be complete at the expiration of the third day of such publication and such publication shall be sufficient notice of such order and of the nuisance therein mentioned to all persons having any duty or liability in relation thereto under the provisions of this chapter.






*§ 17-149 On what expenses to be a lien.* ::


The expenses attending the execution of any and all orders duly made by the department shall respectively be a several and joint personal charge against each of the owners or part owners and each of the lessees and occupants of the building, business, place, property, matter or thing to which such order relates, and in respect to which such expenses were incurred; and also against every person or body who was by law or contract bound to do that in regard to such business, place, street, property, matter or thing which such order requires. Such expenses shall also be a lien on all rent and compensation due, or to grow due, for the use of any place, room, building, premises, matter or thing to which such order relates, and in respect of which such expenses were incurred, and also a lien on all compensation due, or to grow due, for the cleaning of any street, place, ground, or thing, or for the cleaning, or removal, of any matter, thing, or place, the failure to do which by the party bound so to do, or doing of the same in whole or in part by order of such department, was the cause or occasion of any such order or expense.






*§ 17-150 Suits for expenses.* ::


The department, in case it has incurred any expense, or has rendered service for which payment is due, and as the rules of the department may provide, may institute and maintain a suit against any one liable for such expenses, or against any person, firm, or corporation, owing or who may owe such rent or compensation, and may recover the expenses so incurred under any such order. One or more of such parties liable or interested may be made parties to such action as the department may elect; but the parties made responsible herein for such expenses shall be liable to contribute or to make payment as between themselves, in respect of such expenses, and of any sum recovered for such expenses or compensation, or by any party paid on account thereof, according to the legal or equitable obligation existing between them.






*§ 17-151 Lien on premises.* ::


a. There shall be filed in the office of the department a record of all work caused to be performed by or on behalf of the department in executing any order of the board or department. Such records shall be kept on a building by building basis and shall be accessible to the public during business hours. Within thirty days after the issuance of a purchase or work order to cause such work to be done, entry of such order shall be made on the records of the department. Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties.

b. All expenses incurred by or on behalf of the department for such work, pursuant to this title or any other applicable provision of law, shall constitute a lien upon the land and buildings upon or in respect to which, or either of which, the work required by such order has been done, or expenses incurred, when the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this title shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless the requirements of subdivision a of this section are satisfied; this limitation shall only apply to transactions occurring after the date such record should have been entered pursuant to subdivision a and before the date such entry was made.

c. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the city collector, within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or the agent.

d. If such charge is not paid within thirty days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to receive interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable to such property for a delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry.

e. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 of the code and may be sold, enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the code or may be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of section thirteen hundred fifty-four of the real property actions and proceedings law.

f. Such notice mailed by the city collector pursuant to this section shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section of the code.






*§ 17-152 Validity of lien; grounds for challenge.* ::


a. In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on:

   (1) The lawfulness of the work done; or

   (2) The propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this section.

b. No such challenge may be made except by (1) the owner of the property, or (2) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but for the provision of section 17-151, have priority over the department's lien.

c. With respect to any issue specified in subdivision a of this section the certificate of the department filed pursuant to section 17-153 shall be presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein.






*§ 17-153 Statement of expenses of executing orders.* ::


a. When the department shall have executed, or so far executed as the department may require, any order, a certificate setting forth the expenses of such execution, itemized generally, and the date thereof shall be filed among the records of the department with the order so executed; and the department shall take care by, or through some proper officer, or otherwise, that the expenses of such execution be so stated with fairness and accuracy.

b. When it shall appear that such execution or the expenses thereof, related to several lots or buildings belonging to different persons, such certificate shall state what belongs to, or arose in respect to each lot of such several lots or buildings, as the department or its authorized officer may direct; and the department may revise the correctness of such apportionment of expenses as truth and justice may require.

c. Whenever the expenses attending the execution of any order of the department may be made the subject of a suit by it, there may be joined in the same suit a claim or claims for any penalty or penalties for violation of any health provisions, or for the violation or omission to perform or obey such order, or any prior order of the department, or for the not doing of that, or any portion of that, for the doing of which such expenses arose or were incurred; and the proper joint or several judgment may be had against one or more of the defendants in the suit, as they or either of them may be liable in respect of both such claims, or either or any of them.






*§ 17-154 Service of order or judgment.* ::


The department may serve a copy of the order under or by reason of which such expenses were authorized or incurred with a copy of the affidavit stating the expenses of the execution of such order, or if the claim be a judgment, may serve a transcript of such judgment, and an affidavit showing the expense of its execution if there be any, upon any person or corporation, owing, or who is about to owe any such compensation, or owing or about to owe any rent or compensation for the use or occupation of any grounds, premises or buildings or any part thereof, to which such order or judgment relates, and in respect of which such expenses embraced in such judgment related or were incurred, and may, at the time of such service, demand in writing that such rent, or any such compensation to the extent of such claim for such expenses, or for any such judgment or expenses in executing the same, when such rent or compensation becomes due and payable, be paid to the department.

*§ 17-156 Refusal to pay department.* ::


Any person or corporation refusing or omitting to make such payment to the department after service of such paper and demand, shall be personally liable to the department for the amount that should have been paid to it, and may by the department be sued therefor; and such persons shall not in such suit dispute or call in question the authority of the department to incur, or order such expense or the validity or correctness of such expenses of judgment in any particular, or the right of the department to have the same paid from such rent or compensation.






*§ 17-157 Payment to department; effect.* ::


The receipt of the department for any sum so paid, in all suits and proceedings, and for every purpose, shall be as effectual in favor of any person holding the same as actual payment of the amount thereof to the proper landlord, lessor, owner, or other person or persons who would, except for the provisions of section 17-155 of this title, and of such demand, have been entitled to receive the sum so paid. No tenant or occupant of any lot, building or premises, shall be dispossessed or disturbed, nor shall any lease or contract, or rights, be forfeited or impaired, nor any forfeiture or liability be incurred by reason of any omission to pay to any landlord, owner, lessor, contractor, party, or other person, the sum so paid to the department, or any part thereof.






*§ 17-158 Department to retain moneys until twelve days after notice.* ::


The department shall retain money so paid until twelve days after it shall be made to appear to it or some proper officer thereof, by satisfactory affidavit, that the party or parties, or his, her or their agent for the collection of any such rent or compensation, who, but for the provisions hereof would have been entitled to receive the same, has had written notice of such payment being made; and if at the end of such twelve days such party or parties, so notified, have not instituted suit to recover such money, then it shall, by the department be paid to the commissioner of finance.






*§ 17-159 Infected and uninhabitable houses; vacation orders.* ::


Whenever it shall be certified to the department by an officer or inspector of the department that any building or any part thereof in the city is infected with communicable disease, or by reason of want of repair has become dangerous to life or is unfit for human habitation because of defects in drainage, plumbing, ventilation, or the construction of the same, or because of the existence of a nuisance on the premises which is likely to cause sickness among its occupants, the department may issue an order requiring all persons therein to vacate such building or part thereof for the reasons to be stated therein. The department shall cause such order to be affixed conspicuously in such building or part thereof and to be personally served on the owner, lessee, agent, occupant, or any person having the charge or care thereof. If the owner, lessee or agent can not be found in the city or does not reside therein, or evades or resists service, then such order may be served by depositing a copy thereof in the post-office in the city, properly enclosed and addressed to such owner, lessee or agent, at his or her last known place of business and residence, and prepaying the postage thereon; such building or part thereof within ten days after such order shall have been so posted and mailed, or within such shorter time, not less than twenty-four hours, as in such order may be specified, shall be vacated, but the department whenever it shall become satisfied that the danger from such building or part thereof has ceased to exist, or that such building has been repaired so as to be habitable, may revoke such order.

Such proceeding shall be instituted through a petition addressed to such court containing a brief statement of the reasons therefor, and shall not be required to contain further allegations of facts than those which have actuated the department in this proceeding, which shall then be carried on in the manner prescribed for a capital project proceeding by subchapter one of chapter three of title five of the code. The owner of such building or any person interested therein may in his or her answer dispute the necessity of the destruction of such building or part thereof, as the case may be.

2. Shall in the second case be the amount estimated as the value of the building if it had been put into a sanitary condition, or into reasonably good repair, after deducting the estimated expense of putting it into such condition or repair; and

3. Shall in the third case be the value of the materials of the building.

--------------------------------------------------



*§ 17-401 Findings and declaration.* ::


The council declares that due to the irreversible nature of the sterilization procedure, it is essential that the patient fully comprehends the effects and possible complications of the operation. The patient should have a reasonable time to consider his or her decision and possible alternative methods of contraception before the operation is performed.

2. A patient who has completed the appropriate forms and informational session and who signs the required consent form at least thirty days prior to the anticipated sterilization may be sterilized in less than thirty days if that patient is, within the thirty-day period, admitted to a facility for emergency abdominal surgery and the sterilization is concurrent with the abdominal surgery, but in no case shall the sterilization occur less than seventy-two hours after the initial consent.

3. If a patient appears for delivery or emergency abdominal surgery at a facility other than that at which the patient has completed the appropriate forms and informational session, the receiving facility shall contact, by telephone, the facility at which the forms and procedures were completed for verification of same. This must be noted in the record, with the name and title of the person providing the information, the date that the consent form was signed and the anticipated delivery date if under subdivision one of this section or sterilization date if under subdivision two of this section. If it is verified that the consent form was signed at least thirty days prior to the anticipated delivery or sterilization date, the receiving facility may perform the sterilization operation. Telephone verification may not be waived unless the patient presents a duplicate copy of the initial consent, duly signed, witnessed and dated at least thirty days prior to the anticipated delivery or sterilization date.






*§ 17-405 Requirements for informed consent.* ::


No sterilization shall be performed which does not meet the following conditions:

1. Initial consent may not be elicited from a female patient during admission or hospitalization for childbirth or abortion.

During the session, information about the irreversibility of sterilization, alternative methods of contraception, and the corresponding risks must be discussed in the preferred language of the patient.

3. Written informed consent for sterilization must be obtained from each patient. A standardized consent form must be used to satisfy this requirement. The form, supplied by the department must be explained orally by the counselor in the presence of a witness. A copy of the signed consent form shall be provided the patient.

4. On admission to the facility where the sterilization will be performed each patient must give written affirmation of his or her informed consent to the sterilization.

5. The patient must be given oral and written assurance that medical services or benefits will not be lost as a result of refusing sterilization.

6. Contraceptive devices will be prescribed for the patient's use during the thirty-day waiting period.

7. Consent for the sterilization may be revoked any time prior to the operation.






*§ 17-406 Consent form.* ::


The standardized consent form provided by the department must include information about the irreversibility of sterilization, alternative methods of contraception and the corresponding risks.






*§ 17-407 Reports.* ::


The obstetrics or gynecology department of each hospital where sterilizations are performed, the administrator in charge of each clinic where sterilizations are performed, and physicians in private practice who perform sterilizations must submit monthly reports of the number of sterilizations performed to the department of health and mental hygiene. Forms will be provided by the department.






*§ 17-408 Enforcement proceedings.* ::


a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be liable and responsible for a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars to be recovered in a civil action but in the name of the city in any court of record in the city.

The commissioner may in his or her discretion request the corporation counsel to institute legal proceedings to restrain, correct or enjoin any violation of this chapter; and the corporation counsel shall thereupon institute such action or proceeding as may be necessary and appropriate for such purpose.

If a drainage system is used it shall comply with federal, state, and local laws relating to pollution control.

      (g) In the event that a pet shop has a pregnant or nursing dog on its premises, the pet shop shall provide a whelping box for such dog.

      (c) Under no circumstances shall the animal remain inside the primary enclosure or cage while it is being cleaned with sterilizing agents or agents toxic to animals or cleaned in a manner likely to threaten the health and safety of the animal.

      (d) Trash and waste products on the premises shall be properly contained and disposed of so as to minimize the risks of disease, contamination, and vermin.

For animals eighteen months of age or older, such examination shall include a diagnosis of any congenital conditions that adversely affect the health of the animal. Any animal diagnosed with a contagious disease shall be treated and caged separately from healthy animals in the isolation area required pursuant to subparagraph (h) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 17-1705 of this chapter.
