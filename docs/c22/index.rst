Chapter 1: Department of Social Services
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 21-101 Definitions.* ::


Whenever used in this chapter the following words shall have the following meanings:

a. "Commissioner" shall mean the commissioner of social services of the city.

b. "Department" shall mean the department of social services of the city.

c. "Institution" shall include any charitable corporation, one of the objects of which is the care of children or the placing of children in families.






*§ 21-102 Powers of commissioner as to destitute children.* ::


The commissioner shall have power to commit, place out, discharge, or transfer any child who may be in his or her custody, or who may have been placed by him or her in an institution as a public charge, whenever in his or her judgment it shall be for the best interests of such child so to do. In placing out such children, the commissioner may assign one or more of his or her subordinates to make the necessary investigations. He or she may employ any duly incorporated charitable institution or society and may reimburse such institution or society for any expenses, other than salaries, actually incurred in the placing out, supervision, and transfer, if necessary, of children who are public charges. An institution to which a child has been committed, as in this section provided, shall have the authority to place such child in a family, or consent to his or her adoption.






*§ 21-103 Limitations on powers of commissioner as to destitute children.* ::


In placing out, transferring or committing any such child, the commissioner, or any institution or society employed by the commissioner, when practicable, shall place out the child with an individual of the same religious faith as the parents of the child, or transfer or commit the child to an institution governed by persons of the same religious faith as the parents of the child. The commissioner shall commit such child only to an institution which the state board of social welfare has certified as having complied with the rules and regulations as established by such board for such institutions, pursuant to section one of article eight of the state constitution. The commissioner may commit such child to an institution situated without the city only if such board has also certified that such institution is properly protected against fire and other dangers.






*§ 21-104 Term of commitment of children; discharge.* ::


a. The term of commitment of each destitute and neglected child shall be:

   1. Until such child shall attain the age of sixteen years, or

   2. Until such child shall be given over in adoption by the institution to which it shall have been committed to some suitable person, or

   3. Until such child shall be returned to its parents, relatives, or guardians, or otherwise discharged.

b. The commissioner, may, however, provide care in an institution, agency boarding home, or family free or boarding home for any destitute minor between sixteen and eighteen years of age who cannot be properly cared for in his or her own home, either directly or through authorized agencies, except that direct placements in agency boarding homes may be made by the commissioner only if the state board of social welfare shall have authorized him or her to operate such homes and only if suitable care is not otherwise available through an authorized agency under the control of persons of the same religious faith as the child. Such care may be continued after the eighteenth birthday of the minor and until he or she is discharged from care or becomes twenty-one years of age.






*§ 21-105 Reports and records of institutions.* ::


Each such institution caring for destitute and neglected children shall file with the commissioner at the end of every three months a list containing both the names of all the children received or discharged during the month, and the names and residence of the parents and guardians of such children so far as known. Each such institution shall keep a book in which it shall cause to be entered the name and address of each parent, relative or other person visiting an inmate of such institution who is in whole or in part a charge upon the city, and such name and address shall be entered upon the occasion of each visit by any such person.






*§ 21-106 Payments to private institutions.* ::


Payments shall not be made by the city to any charitable, eleemosynary or reformatory institutions wholly or partly under private control, for the care, support, secular education or maintenance of any destitute, neglected or delinquent child therein, except upon the certificate of the commissioner that such child has been received and is retained by such institution pursuant to the rules and regulations established by the state board of social welfare. Moneys paid by the city to any such institution for the care, support, secular education or maintenance of its inmates shall not be expended for any other purpose. Whenever the commissioner shall decide, after reasonable notice to such institution and a hearing, that any such child who is received and retained in such institution is not a proper charge against the public, and written notice of such decision is given by the commissioner to such institution, thereupon all right on the part of such institution to receive compensation from the city for the further retention of the child shall cease. The commissioner shall file in the office of the department a statement of the reasons for his or her decision and of the facts upon which it is founded, and shall furnish a copy to such institution where the child is detained. The commissioner's decision may be reviewed on certiorari by the supreme court. No money shall be paid out of any appropriation to any charitable, eleemosynary or reformatory institution which shall deny or limit admission to any destitute, neglected or delinquent children duly committed by the commissioner or a court of appropriate jurisdiction, because of the race, color or religion of such children, provided, however, that no institution of a particular religious faith shall be required to accept children adhering to a religious faith other than its own. The commission on foster care of children shall have the power and continuing duty to investigate and determine, upon complaint made and shall have the power on its own initiative to investigate and determine whether any institution is practicing discrimination in violation of the provisions of the preceding paragraph. The commission may direct that such investigation shall be conducted by one or more of its members or by its secretary or assistant secretary. Whenever in the judgment of the commission, such investigation discloses that there is reason to believe that an institution is practicing discrimination, the commission shall cause a hearing to be held before the commission or before two or more of its members, as it may direct, upon reasonable notice to such institution. The commission shall dismiss the proceedings if it finds upon the basis of such hearing, that such institution is not practicing discrimination. In the event the commission shall find on the basis of such hearing, that such institution is practicing discrimination, it shall certify to the commissioner its findings of fact, together with its determination of the period of time, not to exceed one year, within which the institution shall be permitted to amend its practices and comply with said provisions. The commissioner shall thereupon serve notice of such certification on such institution. All right on the part of such institution to receive moneys from the city shall cease upon the date specified in said certification unless, prior to the expiration thereof, such institution shall have submitted to the commission proof that it has ceased to engage in said violations and the commission shall have found and certified to the commissioner that said institution has complied with said provisions. The institution shall not be deprived of payments for services rendered prior to the date specified in the certification. The determination of the commission that an institution is practicing discrimination, or having been ordered to cease said discrimination has failed to cease, may be reviewed by the supreme court, which may, for good cause shown, during the pendency of such review, stay the termination of the right of such institution to receive moneys from the city. The commission, or any of its members authorized by it to conduct a hearing, may, at any such hearing, compel the attendance of witnesses, administer oaths, take the testimony of any person under oath and require the production of any evidence relating to the matter in question at the hearing. The department and the corporation counsel are authorized upon request by the commission, to make members of their respective staffs available, upon a temporary basis, to the commission, to assist it in conducting the investigations and hearings provided by this section.






*§ 21-107 Power of commissioner as to removal of destitute persons.* ::


The commissioner shall have power to pay for the cost of the removal or transportation of any person who may come under the commissioner's charge whenever in his or her judgment the city will thereby be relieved from an unnecessary or improper charge.






*§ 21-108 Support of poor persons by relatives.* ::


a. The spouse or parent of a recipient of public assistance or care or of a person liable to become in need thereof shall, if of sufficient ability, be responsible for the support of such person, provided that a parent shall be responsible only for the support of his or her minor child. Step-parents shall in a like manner be responsible for the support of minor step-children.

b. If a sufficiently able relative of a poor person fails to support him or her, as in this section provided, and such person is being cared for or is about to be cared for by the commissioner, such commissioner may apply to the family court for an order to compel him or her to pay the reasonable charge determined by such commissioner for the care of such relative during his or her stay in the public or private institution, or home where the commissioner has placed him or her. The proceedings to be taken to make such order and to enforce the same shall be in the name of and conducted by the commissioner. The determination of such commissioner as to the reasonableness of such charges may at any time be reviewed in the family court.

c. Evidence that the poor person mentioned in this section is without adequate means of support shall be presumptive proof of the possibility of his or her becoming a public charge. The relative against whom proceedings are begun for the support of a poor person shall be taken to be of sufficient ability to contribute to the support, unless the contrary shall affirmatively appear to the satisfaction of the court or a judge or justice thereof.

d. Instead of bringing legal proceedings as in this section specified, the commissioner can directly enter into an agreement with a relative for the payment of the charges determined by such commissioner to be the reasonable charge for the care of the person maintained or about to be maintained by such commissioner as a public charge.






*§ 21-109 Recovery from recipient who has property or other means.* ::


a. If it shall at any time be ascertained that any person, who has received support or care or treatment from the city through the commissioner, has real or personal property or other means of enabling him or her to reimburse the city, an action may be maintained in a court of competent jurisdiction, by such commissioner, against such person or his or her estate to recover such sums of money as may have been expended by the city through such commissioner in the support or care or treatment of such person during the period of ten years next preceding such discovery or the death of such person.

b. Instead of bringing the legal proceedings as in this section specified, such commissioner may determine the reasonable value of such support or care or treatment, and enter into an agreement for its payment.

The commissioner shall have charge of the Potter's Fields, and when the necessity therefor shall arise, shall have power to lay out additional Potter's Fields or other public burial places for the poor and strangers and from time to time enclose and extend the same to make enclosures therein and to build vaults therein, and to provide all necessary labor and for interments therein. The Potter's Field on Hart's island, however, shall remain under the control of the department of correction, and the burial of deceased paupers therein shall continue under rules and regulations established by the joint action of the departments of social services and correction, or in case of disagreement between such departments, under such regulations as may be established by the mayor.

In addition, where the solicitation of funds is by appeal in person and where the solicitor receives no compensation for such solicitation, the box or container shall bear on it the word "volunteer" in a conspicuous place.
