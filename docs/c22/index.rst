The commission shall by rule list the categories of goods and services and/or the amount of sales of such goods and services that do not require obtaining a key vendor license or an auxiliary vendor registration and may also, in its discretion, waive a requirement for a key vendor license or auxiliary vendor registration upon a determination that such license or registration is unnecessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter. In addition, the commission shall establish, by rule, a procedure whereby a shipboard gambling business may obtain temporary permission, on an expedited basis, to purchase goods or services from an unlicensed or unregistered vendor in a situation where such purchase is necessary to the operation of such business.

b. The commission may refuse to issue or to renew a certificate of approval to an applicant who has not demonstrated that he or she possesses good character, honesty and integrity. In reaching such a determination, the commission may consider, but is not limited to, the factors set forth in paragraphs (i) through (ix) of subdivision a of this section.

c. The commission may refuse to issue or to renew a license or certificate of approval to an applicant who has knowingly failed to provide the information and/or documentation required in the form prescribed by the commission pursuant to section 20-9005, who has knowingly provided false information or documentation required by the commission pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant hereto.
