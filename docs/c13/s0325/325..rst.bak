Section 325. ::    
        
     
        §  325.  Planning  and  Notification.  a.  Agencies  that award client
      services contracts shall produce a draft and  final  plan  and  schedule
      detailing  anticipated contracting actions for the upcoming fiscal year,
      and shall hold  at  least  one  public  hearing  each  year  immediately
      following  the  release  of  the  draft  plan  and  schedule  to receive
      testimony regarding the plan and schedule. The draft and final plan  and
      schedule  shall  include, but not be limited to: the type of services to
      be provided, the authorized maximum amount of  funding  associated  with
      the  program,  the  authorized  number  of  contracts  to  be  let for a
      particular program, the month and year of the next  planned  competitive
      solicitation.  Failure  to  include  a contract in the plan and schedule
      issued pursuant to this section shall not be  grounds  for  invalidating
      the  contract.  The  procurement  policy  board  shall  promulgate rules
      governing the issuance of the draft and final plans and schedules, which
      shall ensure that  the  draft  plan  and  schedule  is  issued  promptly
      following the submission of the executive budget and that the final plan
      and schedule is issued no later than September thirtieth each year.
        b.  Pursuant  to  rules  of  the procurement policy board, each agency
      shall
        1. for each category of  goods,  services  or  construction  which  is
      regularly  procured  by  the  agency,  periodically  publish in the City
      Record a notice soliciting the names  of  vendors  interested  in  being
      notified of future procurement opportunities in each such category,
        2.  for each category of goods, services or construction for which the
      agency prequalifies vendors for future procurement, periodically publish
      in the City Record a notice soliciting the names and  qualifications  of
      vendors  interested  in  being  considered for prequalification for such
      category, and
        3. publish in the City Record, and where appropriate, in newspapers of
      city, state or national distribution and trade publications, notice of
        (a) the solicitation of bids or proposals pursuant  to  section  three
      hundred  thirteen  and  three  hundred  seventeen  through three hundred
      twenty-two, where the value of a contract is estimated to be  above  the
      small  purchase  limits, except where the agency has determined pursuant
      to  section  three  hundred  eighteen  or  three  hundred  twenty   that
      solicitation should be limited to prequalified vendors,
        (b)  the  award  of  a contract exceeding the small purchase limits in
      value. Each such  notice  of  award  shall  indicate  the  name  of  the
      contractor,  the dollar value of the contract, the procurement method by
      which the contract  was  let,  and  for  contracts  let  by  other  than
      competitive sealed bidding, a citation of the clause of subdivision b of
      section  three  hundred  twelve  pursuant  to which a procurement method
      other than competitive sealed bidding was utilized.
        c. The procurement policy board, in consultation with the commissioner
      of  general  services,  shall  promulgate  rules   providing   for   the
      publication  and content of notices of contract actions required by this
      chapter. Such rules shall include provisions regarding,
        i. the timing and frequency of notices,
        ii. required duration of solicitation periods,
        iii. the form and content of notices, including the  organization  and
      presentation  of  such  notices  within  standard  categories  of goods,
      services and construction which are  sufficiently  detailed  to  provide
      meaningful distinctions among categories.
        d.  The  notice  required  by  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph three of
      subdivision a of this section shall not apply to contracts awarded on an
      emergency basis pursuant to section three hundred fifteen, provided that
      the agency shall, as soon as is practicable, publish notice that such  a
      contract  has  been  entered  into, pursuant to rules of the procurement
    
      policy board, nor shall such notice requirements apply where the  notice
      would  disclose  litigation  strategy or otherwise impair the conduct of
      litigation by the city.
