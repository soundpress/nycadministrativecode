      the solicitation, award and management of each contract of the agency in
      accordance  with  standard  record  maintenance requirements established
      pursuant to section three thousand four of this  charter.    The  agency
      contract  files  shall  contain copies of each determination, writing or
      filing required by this  chapter  pertaining  to  a  contract  and  such
      information as is prescribed by rule of the procurement policy board, in
      such  form  as  is  prescribed  by the procurement policy board.  Agency
      contract  files  shall  be  open  to  public  inspection  with  adequate
      protection for information which is confidential.
        b. Requests by elected officials for contract documentation.  Whenever
      an  elected  official of the city requests documentation relating to the
      solicitation or award of any city contract, the mayor and city  agencies
      shall  promptly  provide  such  documentation  as  is requested or shall
      promptly respond  to  the  requesting  official  with  reason  why  such
      documentation  cannot  be provided.  If the mayor or agency is unable to
      provide the requested documentation within ten business days of the  day
      the  request  is  received,  the  mayor or agency shall within such time
      deliver to the requesting  official  a  statement  of  the  reasons  the
      documentation  can  not  be  promptly provided and shall include in such
      statement a timetable within which the documentation will  be  provided,
      not to exceed thirty days from the date of the original request.
        c.  Centralized  contract and contractor information.  The mayor shall
      ensure that copies of city  contracts  and  other  standard  information
      regarding  city  contracts  and contractors are reasonably available for
      public inspection in accordance with provisions of section one  thousand
      sixty-four of this charter.
