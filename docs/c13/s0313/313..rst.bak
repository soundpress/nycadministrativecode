Section 313. ::    
        
     
        §  313.    Competitive sealed bidding. a.  The term competitive sealed
      bidding shall mean a method of procurement where the award of a contract
      is  made  to  the  lowest  responsible  bidder  whose  bid   meets   the
      requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.
        b. Procedures for competitive sealed bidding.
        1. Bids shall be solicited through an invitation for bids, which shall
      include  a purchase description and a notice of where vendors may obtain
      a copy of  all  contractual  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  the
      procurement.    A  notice  of  the  intention  to  solicit bids shall be
      publicly advertised in accordance with the provisions of  section  three
      hundred  twenty-five of this chapter.  The terms of such contracts shall
      be  settled  by  the  corporation  counsel  as  an  act  of  preliminary
      specification to an invitation for bids.
        2.  The  agency  letting  the contract may reject all bids if it shall
      deem it for the interest of the city so to do; if not, it shall, without
      other consent or approval, award the contract to the lowest  responsible
      bidder,  unless  the  mayor  shall  determine in writing, justifying the
      reasons therefor, that it is in the best interest of the city that a bid
      other than that of the lowest  responsible  bidder  shall  be  accepted.
      Such  determination shall be published in the City Record.  Tie bids are
      to be decided by the agency letting the contract  and  the  award  made.
      Whenever  a  contract is awarded to other than the lowest bidder because
      the lowest bidder is determined by the agency not to  be  a  responsible
      bidder or because the lowest bid is determined by the agency to not meet
      the  requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, the
      agency making  such  determination  and  awarding  such  contract  shall
      immediately  notify  the  lowest  bidder of such determination and shall
      file in the agency contract file a statement in detail  of  the  reasons
      therefor.
        3.  Any  bidder  who  is declared not responsible by an agency and any
      bidder whose bid is determined by an agency to not meet the requirements
      and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids may, within five  days
      of receipt of notice of the agency decision, appeal such decision to the
      agency  head.    A  determination  of  an  agency head of an appeal of a
      decision of non-responsibility may be appealed to the  mayor  who  shall
      take  final  action regarding such matter.  A determination of an agency
      head of  an  appeal  of  a  decision  that  a  bid  does  not  meet  the
      requirements  and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids shall be
      final.
        c.  No bid shall be valid unless  accompanied  by  a  deposit  in  the
      amount  and  manner  set  forth and specified in the proposal; provided,
      however,  that  the  procurement  policy  board  shall  establish   such
      requirements  for  bid  deposits  as are necessary and practicable, and,
      pursuant to rules and standards, may waive the bid  deposit  requirement
      for  specific  classes  of  purchase or types of transactions.  Upon the
      award of the contract the deposits  of  unsuccessful  bidders  shall  be
      returned  to  them,  and the deposit of   the successful bidder shall be
      returned upon execution of the contract and furnishing of  the  required
      security.
        d.    Every  invitation for bids shall contain a provision that in the
      event of the failure of the bidder to execute the contract  and  furnish
      the  required  security within ten days after notice of the award of the
      contract, the deposit or so much thereof as shall be applicable  to  the
      amount  of  the award made shall be retained by the city, and the bidder
      shall be liable for and shall agree to  pay  on  demand  the  difference
      between  the  price  bid  and the price for which such contract shall be
      subsequently relet, including the cost of such reletting  and  less  the
      amount  of  such deposit.  No plea of mistake in such accepted bid shall
    
      be available to the bidder for the recovery  of  the  deposit  or  as  a
      defense to any action based upon such accepted bid.
