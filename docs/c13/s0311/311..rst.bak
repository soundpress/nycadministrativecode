      policy board  consisting  of  five  members,  three  of  whom  shall  be

      The remaining members shall not be prohibited  from  holding  any  other

      provision of technical, consultant or  personal  services,  which  shall
      include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  circumstances  where  the  use  of
      procurement is (a) desirable to  develop,  maintain  or  strengthen  the
      relationships  between  non-profit  and charitable organizations and the
      communities where services are to be provided,  (b)  cost-effective,  or
      (c)  necessary to (i) obtain special expertise, (ii) obtain personnel or
      expertise not available in the agency, (iii) to provide  a  service  not
      needed  on  a  long-term  basis,  (iv)  accomplish work within a limited
      amount of time, or (v) avoid a conflict of interest;

      approved,  and  time  schedules  within which city officials should take

      individual   contracts,   which  rules  shall  specify  the  appropriate
      remedies, including monetary remedies, for failure to meet the terms  of
      any applicable schedule for taking such actions. The board may set forth

      schedules  for  actions  by  the  division  of  economic  and  financial
      opportunity  of  the  department  of  small  business  services  and the
      division of labor services of such department shall require the approval
      of each division, as such rules pertain  to  actions  required  of  such
      divisions, prior to the adoption of such rules by the procurement policy
      board;
        7.  procedures  for  the  fair  and  equitable  resolution of contract
      disputes; and
        8. rules relating to the making of small purchases in  a  manner  that

      provisions  of  this chapter. The board shall annually review all of its
      rules, policies and procedures and make  such  revisions  as  the  board
      deems  necessary  and  desirable. Nothing herein shall prevent the board

      revisions as the board deems necessary and desirable, more than once per
      year.
        d. The board shall promulgate  rules  to  facilitate  the  timely  and

      to meet annual financial audit requirements through  the  acceptance  of
      consolidated  audits  across  multiple  contracts and multiple agencies;
      (ii) rules providing for expedited  renewal  or  extension  of  existing

        f. In the promulgation of any rules pertaining to the  procurement  of
      construction  or  construction related services, the board shall consult
      with any office designated by the mayor to provide overall  coordination
      to the city's capital construction activities.
        g. The board shall make such recommendations as it deems necessary and
      proper  to  the  mayor  and  the  council  regarding  the  organization,
      personnel structure and management of the  agency  procurement  function
      including,  where  appropriate,  recommendations  for  revision  of this
      charter or local laws affecting procurement by the  city.  Such  reports
      may  include  recommendations regarding agency use of advisory groups to
      assist in preparation of bids or proposals and selection of contractors.
      The board shall also review  the  form  and  content  of  city  contract
      documents  and  shall  submit  to the law department recommendations for
      standardization and simplification of contract language.
        h. The board shall not exercise authority with respect to the award or
      administration of any  particular  contract,  or  with  respect  to  any
