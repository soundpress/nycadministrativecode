Section 312. ::    
        
     
        §  312. Procurement; general rule and exceptions. a. Prior to entering
      into, renewing, or extending a contract valued at more than two  hundred
      thousand dollars to provide standard or professional services, including
      agency  task  orders  pursuant to multi-agency task order contracts, but
      excluding emergency  procurements,  government-to-government  purchases,
      and  the procurement of legal services or consulting services in support
      of current or  anticipated  litigation,  investigative  or  confidential
      services,  an  agency  shall follow the procedure established herein and
      the mayor shall comply with the  reporting  requirements  set  forth  in
      paragraph 8.
        1.  Prior to issuing an invitation for bids, request for proposals, or
      other solicitation, or renewing or extending an existing  contract,  the
      agency  shall  determine whether such contract is the result of or would
      result in the displacement of any city employee within the  agency.  For
      the  purpose  of  this section, "displacement" shall mean a reduction in
      the number of funded positions,  including  but  not  limited  to,  that
      resulting  from  the  attrition;  layoff; demotion; bumping; involuntary
      transfer to a new class, title, or location; time-based  reductions,  or
      reductions  in  customary  hours of work, wages, or benefits of any city
      employee.
        a. There shall be a presumptive determination that a proposed contract
      is the result of or would result in displacement if any of the following
      events occurred in the three year period preceding the date  the  agency
      intends  to issue an invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other
      solicitation, or renew or extend an existing contract:
        (1) the displacement of a city employee within the agency who performs
      or has performed the services sought by  the  proposed  contract  and/or
      services of a substantially similar nature or purpose; or
        (2)  the  announcement  of  spending  reductions  in connection with a
      budgetary program, including but not limited to a Program  to  Eliminate
      the Gap, that could result or has resulted in the displacement of a city
      employee  within  the  agency who performs or has performed the services
      sought by the proposed  contract  and/or  services  of  a  substantially
      similar nature or purpose; or
        (3)  any  other  statement  by  an  agency  or the mayor of a specific
      anticipated employment action that could result or has resulted  in  the
      displacement  of  a  city employee within the agency who performs or has
      performed the services sought by the proposed contract  and/or  services
      of a substantially similar nature or purpose.
        b.  If  the  agency  determines  that displacement would not occur, it
      shall include a certification to that effect, signed by the agency head,
      in  any  invitation  for  bids,  request   for   proposals,   or   other
      solicitation,   or   with   any  contract  renewal  or  extension.  Such
      certification shall detail the basis upon which  the  agency  determined
      that  displacement would not occur, construing broadly the nature of the
      services sought and providing information including but not limited  to:
      (i)  whether  any civil service title and/or job title within the agency
      currently  performs  the  services  solicited  and/or  services   of   a
      substantially  similar  nature or purpose, the names of such titles, and
      the extent to  which  agency  employees  within  such  titles  currently
      perform  such  services;  (ii)  whether  the  solicited services expand,
      supplement, or replace existing services,  and  a  detailed  description
      comparing  the  solicited  services  with  such existing services; (iii)
      whether there is capacity within the  agency  to  perform  the  services
      solicited  and,  if  there  is  no such capacity, a detailed description
      specifying the ways in which the agency lacks such  capacity;  (iv)  for
      the  term of the proposed contract, the projected headcount of employees
      within such  titles  or  employees  who  perform  such  services  and/or
    
      services   of  a  substantially  similar  nature  or  purpose;  and  (v)
      confirmation that none of the events set forth in subparagraph a of this
      paragraph occurred within the agency in the three year period  preceding
      the  date  such  agency intends to issue an invitation for bids, request
      for proposal, or other solicitation, or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
      contract.
        c.  If the agency determines that displacement would occur, the agency
      shall  determine  the  costs  incurred  and  the  benefits  derived   in
      performing  the  service,  consistent  with the scope and specifications
      within the solicitation, renewal, or extension, with city employees, and
      shall submit such analysis, with all supporting documentation, prior  to
      issuance  of  any  solicitation  or  entry  into any contract renewal or
      extension, to the comptroller.
        2. Immediately upon receipt of bids, proposals, and other solicitation
      responses, or prior to the renewal or extension of an existing contract,
      the agency shall submit such  determination,  analysis,  and  supporting
      documentation   to   the  council  and  to  the  appropriate  collective
      bargaining representatives representing employees who would be  affected
      pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section.
        3.  Prior  to  award  of  a  contract, a renewal, or an extension, the
      agency shall perform a comparative analysis of the costs expected to  be
      incurred  and  the  benefits  expected to be derived from entering into,
      renewing, or extending a contract with the  proposed  vendor,  based  on
      such  vendor's  best  and final offer, and such agency's analysis of the
      costs incurred and the benefits derived from providing the service  with
      city  employees.  If  the agency head intends to award, renew, or extend
      the contract, he or she shall submit the reasons therefor, together with
      such analysis, and all supporting documentation, to the comptroller, the
      council,  and  the  appropriate  collective  bargaining  representatives
      representing  employees who would be affected pursuant to paragraph 1 of
      subdivision a of this section.
        4. The council may, within thirty days after receipt of such  reasons,
      analysis, and supporting documentation hold a hearing on this matter. No
      contract  award,  renewal,  or  extension  shall  be  made  prior to the
      expiration of this thirty-day period or a council hearing, whichever  is
      sooner.
        5.  a.  All  cost and comparative analyses required under this section
      shall be conducted in accordance with standard methodology of the office
      of  management  and  budget,  and  consistent  with  the  rules  of  the
      procurement  policy  board,  as  both  are  modified  herein, subject to
      further modification by local  law.  Such  analyses  shall  include  all
      reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the  service using city
      employees and  all  reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the
      service under the proposed contract or contract renewal or extension.
        b.   Such   analyses   shall   further   include   the  total  number,
      qualifications, job descriptions, and titles  of  all  personnel  to  be
      employed  by  the vendor under the proposed contract or contract renewal
      or extension, as well as the nature and cost of salaries and benefits to
      be provided to such personnel.
        c. Such analyses shall further include, but not  be  limited  to,  the
      cost  of  employee  supervision directly related to the provision of the
      service,   vendor   solicitation,   contract    preparation,    contract
      administration, monitoring and evaluating the contractor, capitalization
      of  equipment  over the period such equipment shall be in use, supplies,
      the cost of providing the equivalent quantity and quality of service  by
      city  employees  compared  to  the  cost  of  providing  such service by
      contract, based upon the best and final offer of  the  proposed  vendor,
    
      and  such  other factors as will assist in arriving at full and accurate
      cost determinations and comparisons.
        6.  The  reasons  given to award, renew, or extend the contracts shall
      include all factors that have been  considered  in  determining  whether
      contracting  for  this  service  is  in  the  best interest of the city,
      whether or not such reasons are contained within the cost or comparative
      analyses. Such factors  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the
      potential  for  contractor  default,  the  time  required to perform the
      service, and the quality of the service to be delivered.
        7. The mayor or his or her designee may prepare and implement  a  plan
      of  assistance for displaced city employees, which may include, but need
      not be limited to,  training  to  place  such  employees  in  comparable
      positions within the contracting agency or any other agency. The cost of
      such  assistance plan may be included within the cost of contracting-out
      in the cost and comparative analyses.
        8. a. For the purposes of  this  paragraph,  "agency"  means  a  city,
      county,  borough  or other office, position, administration, department,
      division, bureau, board, commission,  authority,  corporation,  advisory
      committee  or other agency of government, the expenses of which are paid
      in whole or in part from the city treasury, and shall include but not be
      limited to, the  department  of  education,  the  health  and  hospitals
      corporation,  and  the  New  York  city housing authority, but shall not
      include any court, or any local development corporation or other not for
      profit corporation or  institution,  including  such  a  corporation  or
      institution maintaining or operating a public library, museum, botanical
      garden,  arboretum, tomb, memorial building, aquarium, zoological garden
      or similar facility.
        b. The mayor shall, no later than July 31st of each year, produce  and
      publish  on  the  mayor's office of contract services website a plan and
      schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated  contracting  actions
      of  each such agency for the upcoming fiscal year. The plan and schedule
      shall include: (i) information specific to each  prospective  invitation
      for  bids,  request  for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but
      not limited to, the nature of services sought, the term of the  proposed
      contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
      the anticipated fiscal year quarter of  the  planned  solicitation,  the
      civil  service  and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the
      services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
      purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
      perform such services; and (ii) information specific  to  each  proposed
      contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
      modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
      contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
      reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the month
      and year of the expiration of the existing contract, the  civil  service
      and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the services sought
      and/or services of a substantially similar nature or  purpose,  if  any,
      and  the  headcount  of  employees  within  such titles who perform such
      services.
        c. If an agency intends to issue an invitation for bids,  request  for
      proposal,  or  other  solicitation,  or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
      contract, but the mayor fails to include  such  prospective  invitation,
      request,  solicitation,  renewal  or extension in the plan and schedule,
      the mayor shall provide public notice  sixty  days  before  such  agency
      issues  such  invitation,  request, or solicitation, or enters into such
      renewal or extension. Such notice, which shall be posted on the  mayor's
      office  of  contract  services  website  and  in  the city record, shall
      include: (i) information specific  to  the  prospective  invitation  for
    
      bids,  request  for  proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not
      limited to, the nature of services sought,  the  term  of  the  proposed
      contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
      the  civil  service  and/or job titles within the agency who perform the
      services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
      purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
      perform such services; or (ii)  information  specific  to  the  proposed
      contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
      modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
      contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
      reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the civil
      service and/or job titles within the agency  who  perform  the  services
      sought  and/or services of a substantially similar nature or purpose, if
      any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who perform  such
      services.
        b. 1. Except as provided for in sections three hundred fourteen, three
      hundred fifteen and three hundred sixteen, contracts shall be awarded by
      competitive  sealed  bidding  under  such  rules as shall be made by the
      procurement policy board, except that, in a special case as  defined  in
      subdivision  b of this section, the head of an agency proposing to award
      such contract may  order  otherwise  in  accordance  with  policies  and
      procedures established by the procurement policy board.
        2.  A  determination  by  the  head  of  an  agency  to use other than
      competitive sealed bidding except as  provided  for  by  sections  three
      hundred  fourteen  and  three  hundred sixteen shall be made in writing,
      stating the reasons why competitive sealed bidding is not practicable or
      not advantageous and why the method of procurement selected pursuant  to
      section three hundred seventeen is the most competitive alternative that
      is  appropriate  under  the  circumstances. The head of the agency shall
      include the determination or a  summary  of  the  determination  in  the
      notice of solicitation, or for an emergency procurement in the notice of
      award,  required  to  be  published  pursuant  to  section three hundred
      twenty-five of this chapter.
        c. 1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "special case"  shall
      be  defined  as a situation in which it is either not practicable or not
      advantageous to the city to use competitive sealed bidding  for  one  of
      the following reasons:
        i.  specifications cannot be made sufficiently definite and certain to
      permit selection based on price alone;
        ii. judgment is required in evaluating competing proposals, and it  is
      in  the  best  interest  of  the  city  to require a balancing of price,
      quality, and other factors;
        iii. the good, service or construction to  be  procured  is  available
      only from a single source;
        iv.   testing  or  experimentation  is  required  with  a  product  or
      technology, or a new source for a product or technology, or to  evaluate
      the service or reliability of such product or technology; or
        v.  such  other  reasons  as defined by rule of the procurement policy
      board.
        2. The procurement policy board may provide by rule that it is  either
      not  practicable or not advantageous to the city, for one of the reasons
      set forth in paragraph one of this subdivision, to procure  a  specified
      type of good, service or construction by competitive sealed bidding.
