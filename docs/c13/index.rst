As used in this section, the term "member of the auxiliary police" shall mean and include only a volunteer who is a duly enrolled member in good standing of the auxiliary police which the city is authorized to recruit by subdivision five of section twenty-three of the New York state defense emergency act, as enacted by chapter seven hundred eighty-four of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty-one, and who is not within the coverage of the workers' compensation law pursuant to group seventeen of subdivision one of section three of the workers' compensation law.

b. Pursuant to the authorization contained in group nineteen of subdivision one of section three of the workers' compensation law the coverage of the workers' compensation law is hereby extended to the activities of any member of the auxiliary police during any period which such member is actually engaged in auxiliary police activites duly authorized by regulation or order issued pursuant to the New York state defense emergency act including any such activities as may be prescribed by the commissioner of the city pursuant to such regulation or order, such coverage shall extend to such member of the auxiliary police, but only to the extent that such member is not, as to any such activities, covered by article ten of the workers' compensation law.






*§ 14-148 Uniform allowance for members of auxiliary police.* ::


a. Legislative intent. In the public interest and under the powers granted by the charter to the council to enact legislation for the good and welfare of the citizens of New York, it is the intent of the council by this legislation to attract more men and women to serve as auxiliary police. These men or women are trained by our regular police forces and are similarly uniformed and equipped except that they do not carry guns. The appearance on the streets of many men or women wearing the police uniform, in precincts where auxiliary police are active, has done much to reduce the crime rates in those areas. Auxiliary police serve without pay as civic minded citizens. Their presence in uniform on the streets serves to release regular uniformed police for patrol duty and lessens the neighborhood fear of crime. Auxiliary police patrol in pairs and by radio can summon instant assistance from the regular police should they encounter a situation which they have not been trained to handle. Their presence on the streets makes for good community relations between the citizens and the regular police. It is small repayment for the valuable services they render to provide them with a uniform allowance.

b. Allowance. Duly enrolled members in good standing of the auxiliary police, upon successful completion of training, shall receive an initial allowance not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars towards the initial purchase of uniforms and accessories for same, including care and maintenance. The amount of such allowance shall be determined by the police commissioner and shall not exceed the actual costs incurred for such uniforms and accessories including care and maintenance. Such members other than those receiving such initial allowance in the then current or preceding fiscal year, shall be eligible for an allowance towards the purchase of uniforms and accessories for same, including care and maintenance to be awarded to each such member who shall otherwise qualify in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. The commissioner shall determine the amount of the allowance to be awarded based on but not limited to the member's participation, hours of service, expense incurred in maintaining uniforms and equipment and such other facts deemed pertinent by the commissioner. Payments shall be made for the preceding fiscal year after certification by the commanding officer of the auxiliary forces section to the police commissioner of such facts as the commissioner may deem pertinent to enable him or her to make his or her determination.

c. Auxiliary police not to be members of regular police force. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section nothing contained therein shall be construed to constitute such auxiliary police officers members of the regular police force or to entitle them to the privileges and benefits of the regular police force or to become members of the police pension funds.

*§ 14-151 Bias-based profiling prohibited.* ::


a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

   1. "Bias-based profiling" means an act of a member of the force of the police department or other law enforcement officer that relies on actual or perceived race, national origin, color, creed, age, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or housing status as the determinative factor in initiating law enforcement action against an individual, rather than an individual's behavior or other information or circumstances that links a person or persons to suspected unlawful activity.

   2. "Law enforcement officer" means (i) a peace officer or police officer as defined in the Criminal Procedure Law who is employed by the city of New York; or (ii) a special patrolman appointed by the police commissioner pursuant to section 14-106 of the administrative code.

   3. The terms "national origin," "gender," "disability," "sexual orientation," and "alienage or citizenship status" shall have the same meaning as in section 8-102 of the administrative code.

   4. "Housing status" means the character of an individual's residence or lack thereof, whether publicly or privately owned, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, and shall include but not be limited to:

      (i) an individual's ownership status with regard to the individual's residence;

      (iii) an individual's use of publicly assisted housing;

      (iv) an individual's use of the shelter system; and

b. Prohibition.

   1. Every member of the police department or other law enforcement officer shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.

   2. The department shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.

c. Private Right of Action.

   1. A claim of bias-based profiling is established under this section when an individual brings an action demonstrating that:

      (i) the governmental body has engaged in intentional bias-based profiling of one or more individuals and the governmental body fails to prove that such bias-based profiling (A) is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest and (B) was narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling governmental interest; or

      (ii) one or more law enforcement officers have intentionally engaged in bias-based profiling of one or more individuals; and the law enforcement officer(s) against whom such action is brought fail(s) to prove that the law enforcement action at issue was justified by a factor(s) unrelated to unlawful discrimination.

   2. A claim of bias-based profiling is also established under this section when:

      (i) a policy or practice within the police department or a group of policies or practices within the police department regarding the initiation of law enforcement action has had a disparate impact on the subjects of law enforcement action on the basis of characteristics delineated in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section, such that the policy or practice on the subjects of law enforcement action has the effect of bias-based profiling; and

      (ii) The police department fails to plead and prove as an affirmative defense that each such policy or practice bears a significant relationship to advancing a significant law enforcement objective or does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that if such person who may bring an action demonstrates that a group of policies or practices results in a disparate impact, such person shall not be required to demonstrate which specific policies or practices within the group results in such disparate impact; provided further, that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated to result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where such person who may bring an action produces substantial evidence that an alternative policy or practice with less disparate impact is available and the police department fails to prove that such alternative policy or practice would not serve the law enforcement objective as well.

      (iii) For purposes of claims brought pursuant to this paragraph, the mere existence of a statistical imbalance between the demographic composition of the subjects of the challenged law enforcement action and the general population is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation unless the general population is shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable policy or practice or group of policies or practices that allegedly causes the imbalance.

d. Enforcement.

   1. An individual subject to bias-based profiling as defined in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section may file a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to Title 8 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, or may bring a civil action against (i) any governmental body that employs any law enforcement officer who has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, (ii) any law enforcement officer who has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, and (iii) the police department where it has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling or policies or practices that have the effect of bias-based profiling.

   2. The remedy in any civil action or administrative proceeding undertaken pursuant to this section shall be limited to injunctive and declaratory relief.

   3. In any action or proceeding to enforce this section, the court may allow a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs, and may include expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.

This section shall be in addition to all rights, procedures, and remedies available under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Constitution of the State of New York and all other federal law, state law, law of the City of New York or the New York City Administrative Code, and all pre-existing civil remedies, including monetary damages, created by statute, ordinance, regulation or common law.
