      opportunity  of  the  department  of  small  business  services  and the
      division of labor services of such department shall require the approval

      proper  to  the  mayor  and  the  council  regarding  the  organization,
      personnel structure and management of the  agency  procurement  function

Section 312. ::    
        
     
        §  312. Procurement; general rule and exceptions. a. Prior to entering
      into, renewing, or extending a contract valued at more than two  hundred
      thousand dollars to provide standard or professional services, including
      agency  task  orders  pursuant to multi-agency task order contracts, but
      excluding emergency  procurements,  government-to-government  purchases,
      and  the procurement of legal services or consulting services in support
      of current or  anticipated  litigation,  investigative  or  confidential
      services,  an  agency  shall follow the procedure established herein and
      the mayor shall comply with the  reporting  requirements  set  forth  in
      paragraph 8.
        1.  Prior to issuing an invitation for bids, request for proposals, or
      other solicitation, or renewing or extending an existing  contract,  the
      agency  shall  determine whether such contract is the result of or would
      result in the displacement of any city employee within the  agency.  For
      the  purpose  of  this section, "displacement" shall mean a reduction in
      the number of funded positions,  including  but  not  limited  to,  that
      resulting  from  the  attrition;  layoff; demotion; bumping; involuntary
      transfer to a new class, title, or location; time-based  reductions,  or
      reductions  in  customary  hours of work, wages, or benefits of any city
      employee.
        a. There shall be a presumptive determination that a proposed contract
      is the result of or would result in displacement if any of the following
      events occurred in the three year period preceding the date  the  agency
      intends  to issue an invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other
      solicitation, or renew or extend an existing contract:
        (1) the displacement of a city employee within the agency who performs
      or has performed the services sought by  the  proposed  contract  and/or
      services of a substantially similar nature or purpose; or
        (2)  the  announcement  of  spending  reductions  in connection with a
      budgetary program, including but not limited to a Program  to  Eliminate
      the Gap, that could result or has resulted in the displacement of a city
      employee  within  the  agency who performs or has performed the services
      sought by the proposed  contract  and/or  services  of  a  substantially
      similar nature or purpose; or
        (3)  any  other  statement  by  an  agency  or the mayor of a specific
      anticipated employment action that could result or has resulted  in  the
      displacement  of  a  city employee within the agency who performs or has
      performed the services sought by the proposed contract  and/or  services
      of a substantially similar nature or purpose.
        b.  If  the  agency  determines  that displacement would not occur, it
      shall include a certification to that effect, signed by the agency head,
      in  any  invitation  for  bids,  request   for   proposals,   or   other
      solicitation,   or   with   any  contract  renewal  or  extension.  Such
      certification shall detail the basis upon which  the  agency  determined
      that  displacement would not occur, construing broadly the nature of the
      services sought and providing information including but not limited  to:
      (i)  whether  any civil service title and/or job title within the agency
      currently  performs  the  services  solicited  and/or  services   of   a
      substantially  similar  nature or purpose, the names of such titles, and
      the extent to  which  agency  employees  within  such  titles  currently
      perform  such  services;  (ii)  whether  the  solicited services expand,
      supplement, or replace existing services,  and  a  detailed  description
      comparing  the  solicited  services  with  such existing services; (iii)
      whether there is capacity within the  agency  to  perform  the  services
      solicited  and,  if  there  is  no such capacity, a detailed description
      specifying the ways in which the agency lacks such  capacity;  (iv)  for
      the  term of the proposed contract, the projected headcount of employees
      within such  titles  or  employees  who  perform  such  services  and/or
    
      services   of  a  substantially  similar  nature  or  purpose;  and  (v)
      confirmation that none of the events set forth in subparagraph a of this
      paragraph occurred within the agency in the three year period  preceding
      the  date  such  agency intends to issue an invitation for bids, request
      for proposal, or other solicitation, or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
      contract.
        c.  If the agency determines that displacement would occur, the agency
      shall  determine  the  costs  incurred  and  the  benefits  derived   in
      performing  the  service,  consistent  with the scope and specifications
      within the solicitation, renewal, or extension, with city employees, and
      shall submit such analysis, with all supporting documentation, prior  to
      issuance  of  any  solicitation  or  entry  into any contract renewal or
      extension, to the comptroller.
        2. Immediately upon receipt of bids, proposals, and other solicitation
      responses, or prior to the renewal or extension of an existing contract,
      the agency shall submit such  determination,  analysis,  and  supporting
      documentation   to   the  council  and  to  the  appropriate  collective
      bargaining representatives representing employees who would be  affected
      pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section.
        3.  Prior  to  award  of  a  contract, a renewal, or an extension, the
      agency shall perform a comparative analysis of the costs expected to  be
      incurred  and  the  benefits  expected to be derived from entering into,
      renewing, or extending a contract with the  proposed  vendor,  based  on
      such  vendor's  best  and final offer, and such agency's analysis of the
      costs incurred and the benefits derived from providing the service  with
      city  employees.  If  the agency head intends to award, renew, or extend
      the contract, he or she shall submit the reasons therefor, together with
      such analysis, and all supporting documentation, to the comptroller, the
      council,  and  the  appropriate  collective  bargaining  representatives
      representing  employees who would be affected pursuant to paragraph 1 of
      subdivision a of this section.
        4. The council may, within thirty days after receipt of such  reasons,
      analysis, and supporting documentation hold a hearing on this matter. No
      contract  award,  renewal,  or  extension  shall  be  made  prior to the
      expiration of this thirty-day period or a council hearing, whichever  is
      sooner.
        5.  a.  All  cost and comparative analyses required under this section
      shall be conducted in accordance with standard methodology of the office
      of  management  and  budget,  and  consistent  with  the  rules  of  the
      procurement  policy  board,  as  both  are  modified  herein, subject to
      further modification by local  law.  Such  analyses  shall  include  all
      reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the  service using city
      employees and  all  reasonable  costs  associated  with  performing  the
      service under the proposed contract or contract renewal or extension.
        b.   Such   analyses   shall   further   include   the  total  number,
      qualifications, job descriptions, and titles  of  all  personnel  to  be
      employed  by  the vendor under the proposed contract or contract renewal
      or extension, as well as the nature and cost of salaries and benefits to
      be provided to such personnel.
        c. Such analyses shall further include, but not  be  limited  to,  the
      cost  of  employee  supervision directly related to the provision of the
      service,   vendor   solicitation,   contract    preparation,    contract
      administration, monitoring and evaluating the contractor, capitalization
      of  equipment  over the period such equipment shall be in use, supplies,
      the cost of providing the equivalent quantity and quality of service  by
      city  employees  compared  to  the  cost  of  providing  such service by
      contract, based upon the best and final offer of  the  proposed  vendor,
    
      and  such  other factors as will assist in arriving at full and accurate
      cost determinations and comparisons.
        6.  The  reasons  given to award, renew, or extend the contracts shall
      include all factors that have been  considered  in  determining  whether
      contracting  for  this  service  is  in  the  best interest of the city,
      whether or not such reasons are contained within the cost or comparative
      analyses. Such factors  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the
      potential  for  contractor  default,  the  time  required to perform the
      service, and the quality of the service to be delivered.
        7. The mayor or his or her designee may prepare and implement  a  plan
      of  assistance for displaced city employees, which may include, but need
      not be limited to,  training  to  place  such  employees  in  comparable
      positions within the contracting agency or any other agency. The cost of
      such  assistance plan may be included within the cost of contracting-out
      in the cost and comparative analyses.
        8. a. For the purposes of  this  paragraph,  "agency"  means  a  city,
      county,  borough  or other office, position, administration, department,
      division, bureau, board, commission,  authority,  corporation,  advisory
      committee  or other agency of government, the expenses of which are paid
      in whole or in part from the city treasury, and shall include but not be
      limited to, the  department  of  education,  the  health  and  hospitals
      corporation,  and  the  New  York  city housing authority, but shall not
      include any court, or any local development corporation or other not for
      profit corporation or  institution,  including  such  a  corporation  or
      institution maintaining or operating a public library, museum, botanical
      garden,  arboretum, tomb, memorial building, aquarium, zoological garden
      or similar facility.
        b. The mayor shall, no later than July 31st of each year, produce  and
      publish  on  the  mayor's office of contract services website a plan and
      schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated  contracting  actions
      of  each such agency for the upcoming fiscal year. The plan and schedule
      shall include: (i) information specific to each  prospective  invitation
      for  bids,  request  for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but
      not limited to, the nature of services sought, the term of the  proposed
      contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
      the anticipated fiscal year quarter of  the  planned  solicitation,  the
      civil  service  and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the
      services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
      purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
      perform such services; and (ii) information specific  to  each  proposed
      contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
      modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
      contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
      reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the month
      and year of the expiration of the existing contract, the  civil  service
      and/or  job  titles  within  the  agency who perform the services sought
      and/or services of a substantially similar nature or  purpose,  if  any,
      and  the  headcount  of  employees  within  such titles who perform such
      services.
        c. If an agency intends to issue an invitation for bids,  request  for
      proposal,  or  other  solicitation,  or  renew  or  extend  an  existing
      contract, but the mayor fails to include  such  prospective  invitation,
      request,  solicitation,  renewal  or extension in the plan and schedule,
      the mayor shall provide public notice  sixty  days  before  such  agency
      issues  such  invitation,  request, or solicitation, or enters into such
      renewal or extension. Such notice, which shall be posted on the  mayor's
      office  of  contract  services  website  and  in  the city record, shall
      include: (i) information specific  to  the  prospective  invitation  for
    
      bids,  request  for  proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not
      limited to, the nature of services sought,  the  term  of  the  proposed
      contract,  the method of the solicitation the agency intends to utilize,
      the  civil  service  and/or job titles within the agency who perform the
      services sought and/or services of a  substantially  similar  nature  or
      purpose,  if  any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who
      perform such services; or (ii)  information  specific  to  the  proposed
      contract  renewal  or  extension,  including,  but  not  limited to, any
      modifications sought to the nature of the services performed  under  the
      contract,  the  term  of  the proposed renewed or extended contract, the
      reason(s) the agency intends to renew or extend such contract, the civil
      service and/or job titles within the agency  who  perform  the  services
      sought  and/or services of a substantially similar nature or purpose, if
      any, and the headcount of employees within such titles who perform  such
      services.
        b. 1. Except as provided for in sections three hundred fourteen, three
      hundred fifteen and three hundred sixteen, contracts shall be awarded by
      competitive  sealed  bidding  under  such  rules as shall be made by the
      procurement policy board, except that, in a special case as  defined  in
      subdivision  b of this section, the head of an agency proposing to award
      such contract may  order  otherwise  in  accordance  with  policies  and
      procedures established by the procurement policy board.
        2.  A  determination  by  the  head  of  an  agency  to use other than
      competitive sealed bidding except as  provided  for  by  sections  three
      hundred  fourteen  and  three  hundred sixteen shall be made in writing,
      stating the reasons why competitive sealed bidding is not practicable or
      not advantageous and why the method of procurement selected pursuant  to
      section three hundred seventeen is the most competitive alternative that
      is  appropriate  under  the  circumstances. The head of the agency shall
      include the determination or a  summary  of  the  determination  in  the
      notice of solicitation, or for an emergency procurement in the notice of
      award,  required  to  be  published  pursuant  to  section three hundred
      twenty-five of this chapter.
        c. 1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term "special case"  shall
      be  defined  as a situation in which it is either not practicable or not
      advantageous to the city to use competitive sealed bidding  for  one  of
      the following reasons:
        i.  specifications cannot be made sufficiently definite and certain to
      permit selection based on price alone;
        ii. judgment is required in evaluating competing proposals, and it  is
      in  the  best  interest  of  the  city  to require a balancing of price,
      quality, and other factors;
        iii. the good, service or construction to  be  procured  is  available
      only from a single source;
        iv.   testing  or  experimentation  is  required  with  a  product  or
      technology, or a new source for a product or technology, or to  evaluate
      the service or reliability of such product or technology; or
        v.  such  other  reasons  as defined by rule of the procurement policy
      board.
        2. The procurement policy board may provide by rule that it is  either
      not  practicable or not advantageous to the city, for one of the reasons
      set forth in paragraph one of this subdivision, to procure  a  specified
      type of good, service or construction by competitive sealed bidding.

        §  313.    Competitive sealed bidding. a.  The term competitive sealed
      bidding shall mean a method of procurement where the award of a contract
      is  made  to  the  lowest  responsible  bidder  whose  bid   meets   the
      requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids.
        b. Procedures for competitive sealed bidding.
        1. Bids shall be solicited through an invitation for bids, which shall
      include  a purchase description and a notice of where vendors may obtain
      a copy of  all  contractual  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  the
      procurement.    A  notice  of  the  intention  to  solicit bids shall be
      publicly advertised in accordance with the provisions of  section  three
      hundred  twenty-five of this chapter.  The terms of such contracts shall
      be  settled  by  the  corporation  counsel  as  an  act  of  preliminary
      specification to an invitation for bids.
        2.  The  agency  letting  the contract may reject all bids if it shall
      deem it for the interest of the city so to do; if not, it shall, without
      other consent or approval, award the contract to the lowest  responsible
      bidder,  unless  the  mayor  shall  determine in writing, justifying the
      reasons therefor, that it is in the best interest of the city that a bid
      other than that of the lowest  responsible  bidder  shall  be  accepted.
      Such  determination shall be published in the City Record.  Tie bids are
      to be decided by the agency letting the contract  and  the  award  made.
      Whenever  a  contract is awarded to other than the lowest bidder because
      the lowest bidder is determined by the agency not to  be  a  responsible
      bidder or because the lowest bid is determined by the agency to not meet
      the  requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, the
      agency making  such  determination  and  awarding  such  contract  shall
      immediately  notify  the  lowest  bidder of such determination and shall
      file in the agency contract file a statement in detail  of  the  reasons
      therefor.
        3.  Any  bidder  who  is declared not responsible by an agency and any
      bidder whose bid is determined by an agency to not meet the requirements
      and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids may, within five  days
      of receipt of notice of the agency decision, appeal such decision to the
      agency  head.    A  determination  of  an  agency head of an appeal of a
      decision of non-responsibility may be appealed to the  mayor  who  shall
      take  final  action regarding such matter.  A determination of an agency
      head of  an  appeal  of  a  decision  that  a  bid  does  not  meet  the
      requirements  and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids shall be
      final.
        c.  No bid shall be valid unless  accompanied  by  a  deposit  in  the
      amount  and  manner  set  forth and specified in the proposal; provided,
      however,  that  the  procurement  policy  board  shall  establish   such
      requirements  for  bid  deposits  as are necessary and practicable, and,
      pursuant to rules and standards, may waive the bid  deposit  requirement
      for  specific  classes  of  purchase or types of transactions.  Upon the
      award of the contract the deposits  of  unsuccessful  bidders  shall  be
      returned  to  them,  and the deposit of   the successful bidder shall be
      returned upon execution of the contract and furnishing of  the  required
      security.
        d.    Every  invitation for bids shall contain a provision that in the
      event of the failure of the bidder to execute the contract  and  furnish
      the  required  security within ten days after notice of the award of the
      contract, the deposit or so much thereof as shall be applicable  to  the
      amount  of  the award made shall be retained by the city, and the bidder
      shall be liable for and shall agree to  pay  on  demand  the  difference
      between  the  price  bid  and the price for which such contract shall be
      subsequently relet, including the cost of such reletting  and  less  the
      amount  of  such deposit.  No plea of mistake in such accepted bid shall
    
      be available to the bidder for the recovery  of  the  deposit  or  as  a
      defense to any action based upon such accepted bid.

      accordance with section three hundred twelve, an agency determines  that
      the  use  of  competitive  sealed  bidding  is  not  practicable  or not
      advantageous to the city, the agency shall select the  most  competitive
      alternative method of procurement provided for by sections three hundred
      eighteen through three hundred twenty-two which is appropriate under the
      circumstance.   Each agency contract file shall contain documentation of

      to be considered in selecting the proposal most advantageous to the city
      was  set  forth  in a writing filed in the agency contract file prior to
      the opening of proposals, shall require the approval of the mayor  prior
      to its execution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the mayor may,
      where  the  mayor  has  determined  that  it  is appropriate, exclude an
      agency's contracts or  a  particular  category  of  contracts  from  the

        §  321.  Sole  source.  a.  In  accordance  with section three hundred
      seventeen, a contract may be awarded for a good, service or construction
      without  competition  when  an  agency  determines,  pursuant  to  rules
      promulgated  by  the  procurement  policy  board, that there is only one
      source for the  required  good,  service  or  construction.  The  agency
      contract  file  shall  contain  the  agency's  determination that only a
      single  source  is  available  for  the  required   good,   service   or
      construction,  including  the  process  by  which  the  agency made such
      determination.  Copies  of  such  notice  shall  be   filed   with   the
      comptroller.
        b.  Whenever  an  agency determines that there is only a single source
      for a good, service or construction,  an  agency  shall  give  immediate
      notice in the City Record of such determination and shall in such notice
      solicit  the  application  of  vendors  qualified  to provide such good,
      service or construction, or interested in providing such good service or
      construction in the future. The procurement policy board shall  by  rule
      define  the  timing  and  duration  of  such notification to ensure that
      vendors qualified to provide such good,  service  or  construction  have
      sufficient  opportunity to express their interest to the agency prior to
      the initiation of any sole source negotiation; provided,  however,  that
      if  the  agency  has  determined that it should not reveal to the vendor
      with whom it is negotiating that it is doing so on a sole  source  basis
      under circumstances defined by rule of the procurement policy board, the
      notice required by this subdivision shall be made upon the completion of
      such  negotiations  or  the award of the contract. Vendors interested in
      providing such good, service or construction  in  the  future  shall  be
      prequalified  in  accordance  with section three hundred twenty-four, or
      shall be included for receipt of notice in accordance with subdivision a

      procurement procedure established by  rule  of  the  procurement  policy
      board,  under  circumstances,  defined by rule of the procurement policy
      board, in which the use  of such procedures is in the best  interest  of
      the  city.  An  agency  determination  to  utilize  such  an alternative
      procurement procedure for a particular procurement or for  a  particular
      type  of  procurement  shall  require  the written approval of the mayor
      prior to seeking bids or proposals.   The  agency  contract  file  shall

      prequalified vendors and  entry  into  a  prequalified  group  shall  be
      continuously  available.  Prospective  vendors  may  be  prequalified as
      contractors for the provision of particular types of goods, services and
      construction, in accordance with general criteria established by rule of
      the procurement policy board which may include, but shall not be limited
      to,  the  experience,  past  performance,  ability  to  undertake  work,
      financial  capability,  responsibility,  and  reliability of prospective
      bidders, and which may be supplemented by criteria established  by  rule
      of  the  agency for the prequalification of vendors for particular types
      of goods, services or construction or by criteria published in the  City
      Record  by  the  agency  prior  to the prequalification of vendors for a
      particular procurement.  Such  prequalification  may  be  by  categories
      designated by size and other factors.
        b. Any vendor who is denied prequalification or whose prequalification
      is  revoked  by an agency may appeal such decision to the agency head. A
      determination of an agency  head  may  be  appealed  to  the  office  of
      administrative  trials  and hearings for a hearing and such office shall
      take final action regarding such matter. A  decision  by  an  agency  to
      suspend  a vendor's prequalification may be appealed to the agency head,
      provided that if such suspension extends for more than three  months  it
      shall be deemed a revocation of the prequalification for the purposes of
      this section.

      the  program,  the  authorized  number  of  contracts  to  be  let for a
      particular program, the month and year of the next  planned  competitive
      solicitation.  Failure  to  include  a contract in the plan and schedule

      the  contract.  The  procurement  policy  board  shall  promulgate rules
      governing the issuance of the draft and final plans and schedules, which
      shall ensure that  the  draft  plan  and  schedule  is  issued  promptly

      Record a notice soliciting the names  of  vendors  interested  in  being
      notified of future procurement opportunities in each such category,

      in the City Record a notice soliciting the names and  qualifications  of
      vendors  interested  in  being  considered for prequalification for such
      category, and
        3. publish in the City Record, and where appropriate, in newspapers of
      city, state or national distribution and trade publications, notice of
        (a) the solicitation of bids or proposals pursuant  to  section  three
      hundred  thirteen  and  three  hundred  seventeen  through three hundred
      twenty-two, where the value of a contract is estimated to be  above  the
      small  purchase  limits, except where the agency has determined pursuant
      to  section  three  hundred  eighteen  or  three  hundred  twenty   that
      solicitation should be limited to prequalified vendors,
        (b)  the  award  of  a contract exceeding the small purchase limits in
      value. Each such  notice  of  award  shall  indicate  the  name  of  the
      contractor,  the dollar value of the contract, the procurement method by
      which the contract  was  let,  and  for  contracts  let  by  other  than

      of  general  services,  shall  promulgate  rules   providing   for   the
      publication  and content of notices of contract actions required by this
      chapter. Such rules shall include provisions regarding,

      meaningful distinctions among categories.
        d.  The  notice  required  by  subparagraph  a  of  paragraph three of
      subdivision a of this section shall not apply to contracts awarded on an
      emergency basis pursuant to section three hundred fifteen, provided that
      the agency shall, as soon as is practicable, publish notice that such  a
      contract  has  been  entered  into, pursuant to rules of the procurement
    
      policy board, nor shall such notice requirements apply where the  notice
      would  disclose  litigation  strategy or otherwise impair the conduct of

      than   competitive  sealed  bidding  or  competitive  sealed  bids  from
      prequalified vendors, the value of which exceeds  one  hundred  thousand
      dollars, the agency shall upon reasonable public notice conduct a public
      hearing   to   receive   testimony   regarding  the  proposed  contract.
      Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if within a period of time after
      such notice, which period of time shall be determined by the procurement
      policy board, no individual requests an opportunity to speak at  such  a
      public  hearing  with respect to any such proposed contract the value of
      which does not exceed one million dollars, then such public hearing need
      not be conducted. The procurement policy board may by rule  exempt  from
      this  public hearing requirement contracts to be let which do not differ
      materially in terms and  conditions,  as  defined  by  the  board,  from
      contracts currently held by the city where the parties to such contracts
      are  the  same;  provided, that under no circumstance may such exemption
      apply to any contract in value exceeding ten million dollars.
        b. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any procurement
      (i) let pursuant to a  finding  of  an  emergency  under  section  three
      hundred fifteen, (ii) required to be made on an accelerated basis due to
      markets  which experience significant, short-term price fluctuations, as

Section 328. ::    
        
     
        §  328. Registration of contracts by the comptroller.  a.  No contract
      or agreement executed pursuant to this charter or  other  law  shall  be
      implemented until (1) a copy has been filed with the comptroller and (2)
      either  the  comptroller  has  registered it or thirty days have elapsed
      from the date of filing, whichever is sooner, unless  an  objection  has
      been filed pursuant to subdivision c of this section, or the comptroller
      has grounds for not registering the contract under subdivision b of this
      section.
        b.    Subject  to the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the
      comptroller shall register a contract  within  thirty  days  unless  the
      comptroller has information indicating that:
        i.   there   remains  no  unexpended  and  unapplied  balance  of  the
      appropriation  or  fund  applicable  thereto,  sufficient  to  pay   the
      estimated  expense  of  executing  such  contract,  as  certified by the
      officer making the same;
        ii.    that  a  certification  required  by  section   three   hundred
      twenty-seven of this chapter has not been made; or
        iii.   the proposed vendor has been debarred by the city in accordance
      with the provisions of section three hundred thirty-five.
        c.  The comptroller may, within thirty days of the date of  filing  of
      the  contract  with  the  comptroller's office, object in writing to the
      registration of the contract, if in the comptroller's judgment there  is
      sufficient  reason  to  believe that there is possible corruption in the
      letting of the contract or that the proposed contractor is  involved  in
      corrupt  activity.  Such objection shall be delivered within such thirty
      day period to the mayor setting forth in  detail  the  grounds  for  the
      comptroller's  determination.    After  the   mayor has responded to the
      comptroller's objections  in  writing,  indicating  (i)  the  corrective
      actions if any, that have been taken or will be taken in response to the
      comptroller's  objections,  or  (ii) the reasons why the mayor disagrees
      with the comptroller's objections, the mayor may require registration of
      the contract despite the comptroller's objections.  Such response by the
      mayor shall not  serve  as  the  basis  for  further  objection  by  the
      comptroller,  and the comptroller shall register the contract within ten
      days of receipt of the mayor's response.
        d.  The requirements of this section shall not apply to
        (1) an emergency contract awarded pursuant to  section  three  hundred
      fifteen  or to an accelerated procurement as defined under section three
      hundred twenty-six, provided that  the  agency  shall,  as  soon  as  is
      practicable, submit any such contract to the comptroller for an audit of
      the  procedures  and  basis  for  the  determination  of the need for an
      emergency or accelerated procurement, or
        (2) a contract awarded pursuant to this chapter for the  provision  of
      goods,  services  or  construction that is not to be paid for out of the
      city treasury or out of moneys under the control of the  city,  provided
      that  the  board of the entity awarding such a contract shall within ten
      days of awarding contract, file a copy of such contract and any  related
      materials specified by the mayor, with the mayor or the mayor's designee
      for purposes of section three hundred thirty-four of this charter.

      of  a  specific  good  may  be delegated by the commissioner of citywide
      administrative services, in the best interest of the city, to any agency
      for direct purchase by such agency, and shall  not  be  subject  to  the
      provisions of subdivisions b, c or d of this section; provided, however,
      that  such  delegation  shall  not  be  made  for  goods  that are to be
      generally used by city agencies.

        §  333. Evaluation and monitoring of contractor performance.  a.  Each
      agency  letting  contracts  shall  monitor  the  performance  of   every
      contractor.  Information with respect to contractor performance shall be
      maintained  in  a  central  place  in  accordance  with subdivision c of
      section three hundred thirty-four.
        b. 1. If a borough president determines there is reason to  believe  a
      term  or condition of a contract providing for the delivery of  services
      in the borough is not being complied with and that the  contract  should
      be  terminated for noncompliance, modified, not renewed, modified at the
      time of renewal, or that the existing terms of the  contract  should  be
      enforced,  the  borough  president shall document in writing the reasons
      for  that  determination  and  present  such   determination,   with   a
      recommendation  for   appropriate action, to the agency head for review.
      In the case of a recommendation that a contract should not be renewed or
      should be modified at the time of renewal, such recommendation shall  be
      made  to  the  agency head at least one hundred and twenty days prior to
      the expiration of the contract.
        2. The agency head shall respond to the borough  president's  findings
      within  ten business days from receipt of such findings, indicating what
      action, if any, shall be taken. If such action is  not  satisfactory  to
      the  borough  president, the borough president shall, within thirty days
      of receipt of such responses, be authorized to require that a hearing be
      held in the borough by a contract performance panel  consisting  of  the
      public  advocate,  the comptroller and the mayor, or their designees, to
      receive the testimony of the  borough  president  and  other  interested
      persons  on  the borough president's recommendations.  The hearing shall
      be held within twenty days from the borough president's request for  the
      hearing. The head of the agency which procured the services in question,
      or  a designee of such agency head, and the contractor whose performance
      is being evaluated, shall have the right, and it  shall  be  their  duty
      when requested by the panel, to appear and be heard.
        3.   The panel shall recommend, within thirty days of the date of such
      hearing, such action as it deems appropriate and shall promptly  deliver
      its recommendations in writing to the agency head, borough president and
      contractor. Within thirty days of receipt of the panel's recommendation,
      the  agency  head  shall respond in writing to the panel and the borough
      president, indicating which of  the  panel's  recommendations  shall  be
      acted upon and what, if any, alternative action will be taken.
        4.   In the case of any contract regarding which more than one borough
      president has submitted a determination in accordance with paragraph one
      of this subdivision, the  agency  receiving  such  determinations  shall
      notify  each  such borough president of the agency response submitted in
      accordance with paragraph two of this subdivision.  A hearing,  if  any,
      held shall include the comments of all such borough presidents.

      pursuant to section three thousand four of this  charter.    The  agency
      contract  files  shall  contain copies of each determination, writing or

      solicitation or award of any city contract, the mayor and city  agencies
      shall  promptly  provide  such  documentation  as  is requested or shall
      promptly respond  to  the  requesting  official  with  reason  why  such
      documentation  cannot  be provided.  If the mayor or agency is unable to
      provide the requested documentation within ten business days of the  day
      the  request  is  received,  the  mayor or agency shall within such time
      deliver to the requesting  official  a  statement  of  the  reasons  the
      documentation  can  not  be  promptly provided and shall include in such
      statement a timetable within which the documentation will  be  provided,
      not to exceed thirty days from the date of the original request.
        c.  Centralized  contract and contractor information.  The mayor shall
      ensure that copies of city  contracts  and  other  standard  information
