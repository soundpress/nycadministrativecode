d. If the applicant be a probationary member of the department, the commissioner may allow him or her the time already served as a probationary member to count as time served, but shall not allow the time between the date of his or her dismissal and his or her restoration to count as service in the department.

Employees of the department, not entitled to a trial before dismissal, and who were given an opportunity to explain charges before they were removed, may apply to the mayor, within one year from the date of the order separating them from the service, for a further opportunity to explain, setting forth the reasons for such action. The mayor, in his or her discretion, may grant such application. The commissioner, thereupon, shall afford a further opportunity to the dismissed employee to explain the charges filed against him or her, on which the removal was based. Thereafter the commissioner, in his or her discretion, may reinstate the dismissed employee or reaffirm the previous removal.

*§ 14-132 Proceedings where woman is arrested.* ::


Whenever a woman is arrested and taken to a police station, it shall be the duty of the officer in command of the station to cause a female staff member assigned to this detail to be summoned forthwith, and whenever a woman is arrested in any precinct in which no such female staff member is assigned, she shall be taken directly to the station house designated to receive the women prisoners of the precinct in which the arrest is made. Such separate confinement, or any such removal of any woman, shall not operate to take from any court any jurisdiction which it would have had. The term "woman" as used in this section and section 14-131 of this title shall not include any female either actually or apparently under the age of sixteen years whose care is assumed by any incorporated society for the prevention of cruelty to children; but every such female detainee under the age of sixteen shall be taken directly to a station house designated to receive women prisoners and shall be at once transferred therefrom by the officer in charge, to the custody of such society.

*§ 14-136 Rewards.* ::


a. To members of force. The commissioner for meritorious and extraordinary services rendered by any member of the force in due discharge of his or her duty, may permit any member of the force to retain for his or her own benefit any reward or present, or some part thereof, tendered him or her therefor; and it shall be cause for removal from the force for any member thereof to receive any such reward or present without notice thereof to the commissioner. Upon receiving such notice, the commissioner may either order the said member to retain the same, or shall dispose of it for the benefit of the police pension fund.

b. To informers. The commissioner shall have authority to offer rewards to induce any person to give information which shall lead to the detection, arrest and conviction of persons guilty of a felony and to pay such awards to such persons who shall give such information. Such a reward shall be offered only if there be an unexpended appropriation therefor. The city shall make the necessary appropriation for such purpose.






*§ 14-137 Subpoenas; administration of oaths.* ::


a. The commissioner, and his or her deputies shall have the power to issue subpoenas, attested in the name of the commissioner and to exact and compel obedience to any order, subpoena or mandate issued by them and to that end may institute and prosecute any proceedings or action authorized by law in such cases. The commissioner, and his or her deputies may in proper cases issue subpoena duces tecum. The commissioner may devise, make and issue process and forms of proceedings to carry into effect any powers or jurisdiction possessed by him or her.

b. The commissioner, each of his or her deputies, the chief clerk, and the first and second deputy clerks of such department and hearing officers of the division of licenses or any superior officer of the rank of sergeant or above specifically designated by the commissioner, are hereby authorized and empowered to administer oaths and affirmations in the usual or appropriate forms, to any person in any matter or proceedings authorized as aforesaid, and in all matters pertaining to the department, or the duties of any officer or other person in matters of or connected with such department and to administer oaths of office which may be taken or required in the administration or affairs of such department, and to take and administer oaths and affirmations, in the usual or appropriate forms in taking any affidavit or disposition which may be necessary or required by law or by order, rule or regulation of the commissioner for or in connection with the official purposes, affairs, powers, duties or proceedings of the department, or of such commissioner or member of the force or any official purpose lawfully authorized by said commissioner.

*§ 14-139 Disposal of horses.* ::


Whenever any horses used in the department shall have become unfit for use therein, the commissioner, instead of causing such horses to be sold at auction, may transfer such horses to the custody of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, provided such society is willing to accept the custody thereof, to be disposed of in such manner as such society may deem best. If, however, any horse so received into the custody of such society and formerly used in the department shall thereafter be sold by such society, or any profit be derived from its use, the proceeds from such sale or use shall be paid over by such society to the commissioner, for the benefit of the police pension fund.

Whenever property or money taken from any person arrested shall be alleged to have been feloniously obtained, or to be the proceeds of crime, and brought, with all ascertained claimants thereof, and the person arrested, before a judge of the criminal court for adjudication, and the judge of the criminal court shall be satisfied from the evidence that the person arrested is innocent of the offense alleged, and that the property rightfully belongs to him or her, then such judge thereupon, in writing, may order such property or money to be returned, and the property clerk, if he or she have it, to deliver such property or money to the accused person, and not to any attorney, agent or clerk of such accused person.

d. Disputed ownership. If any claim to the ownership of such property or money shall be made on oath before the judge, by or in behalf of any other persons than the person arrested, and such accused person shall be held for trial or examination, such property or money shall remain in the custody of the property clerk until the discharge or conviction of the person accused and until lawfully disposed of.

   1. Abandoned vehicles subject to the provisions of section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law in the custody of the property clerk shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of such section twelve hundred twenty-four.

If, in the opinion of the commissioner, any such property may be used or converted to use for the purpose of the department or any city, state or federal agency, such property may in the discretion of the commissioner be used or converted to use for any such purpose, and the same need not be sold or destroyed as in this section provided.

   3. Perishable property may be sold as soon as practicable on the best terms available and the proceeds of such sale shall be disposed of as in this section provided.

f. Lawful property right to be established. In any action or proceeding against the property clerk for or on account of any property or money in his or her custody, a claimant from whose possession such property or money was taken or obtained, or any other claimant, shall establish that he or she has a lawful title or property right in such property or money and lawfully obtained possession thereof and that such property or money was held and used in a lawful manner. In any such action or proceeding, a claimant who derives his or her title or right by assignment, transfer or otherwise from or through the person from whose possession such property or money was taken or obtained, shall further establish that such person had a lawful title or property right in such property or money and lawfully obtained possession thereof and that such property or money was held and used in a lawful manner.

g. No action for property or money held as evidence. No action or proceeding may be brought against the property clerk for or on account of any property or money held as evidence in any criminal investigation or proceeding until the termination thereof.

   2. Whenever a stolen motor vehicle or boat, which is in the custody of the property clerk, shall not be removed by the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession thereof within three days after notice by registered mail from the property clerk, such owner or other person shall not be entitled to the return thereof unless he or she shall first pay to the property clerk a storage charge of five dollars for each day, or fraction thereof, after the expiration of such three-day period.

   3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, where the department has incurred charges for removal and storage of an abandoned or stolen motor vehicle pursuant to subchapter thirty-one of chapter two of title twenty of the code, an owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession of such motor vehicle shall not be entitled to the return thereof unless he or she shall first pay all such charges incurred by the department pursuant to such subchapter thirty-one together with any applicable storage charge provided for in this subdivision.

   4. The removal and storage charges provided by this subdivision, or incurred by the department pursuant to subchapter thirty-one of chapter two of title twenty of such code, as applicable, shall be a lien upon such motor vehicle or boat and the property clerk shall refuse to return such motor vehicle or boat until such charges are paid, except that where such motor vehicle or boat is the property of an estate administered by a public administrator, the removal charge and the storage charge shall be general claims against the estate of the deceased.

If any property or money placed in the custody of the property clerk shall be desired to be produced as evidence in any criminal court, such property or money shall be delivered to any officer who shall present an order to that effect from such court. Property or money used as evidence in any criminal court shall not be retained in such court but shall be turned over as soon as practicable to the property clerk to be disposed of according to the provisions of this section.

k. Public administrators not affected. Nothing in this section shall in any way contravene, modify or repeal any existing provision of law, general, special or local, relating to the jurisdiction, powers, privileges, personnel, duties and functions of any public administrator.



* Editor's note: In McClendon v. Rossetti, 460 F.2d 111 , the court held that certain procedures of the police property clerk, which required persons from whom property was taken in the course of an arrest to commence a court proceeding to obtain the return of such property, combined with the provisions of section 14-140(f) of the Administrative Code, which required such persons to prove lawful possession of the property, denied such persons due process of law under the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Subsequent to the McClendon decision, the Police Department and the District Attorneys adopted procedures for claiming property taken or obtained by the police in the course of an arrest which were approved by the McClendon court. These procedures are codified as subchapter B of chapter 12 of title 38 of the Rules of the City of New York.






*§ 14-141 Common law and statutory powers of constables.* ::


The members of the force while on duty in the city and whenever in any other part of this state, shall possess all the common law and statutory powers of constables, except for the service of civil process, and any warrant for search or arrest, issued by any judge of this state, may be executed, in any part thereof, by any member of the force.






*§ 14-147 Workers' compensation for members of auxiliary police.* ::


a. As used in this section, the term "member of the auxiliary police" shall mean and include only a volunteer who is a duly enrolled member in good standing of the auxiliary police which the city is authorized to recruit by subdivision five of section twenty-three of the New York state defense emergency act, as enacted by chapter seven hundred eighty-four of the laws of nineteen hundred fifty-one, and who is not within the coverage of the workers' compensation law pursuant to group seventeen of subdivision one of section three of the workers' compensation law.

b. Pursuant to the authorization contained in group nineteen of subdivision one of section three of the workers' compensation law the coverage of the workers' compensation law is hereby extended to the activities of any member of the auxiliary police during any period which such member is actually engaged in auxiliary police activites duly authorized by regulation or order issued pursuant to the New York state defense emergency act including any such activities as may be prescribed by the commissioner of the city pursuant to such regulation or order, such coverage shall extend to such member of the auxiliary police, but only to the extent that such member is not, as to any such activities, covered by article ten of the workers' compensation law.






*§ 14-148 Uniform allowance for members of auxiliary police.* ::


a. Legislative intent. In the public interest and under the powers granted by the charter to the council to enact legislation for the good and welfare of the citizens of New York, it is the intent of the council by this legislation to attract more men and women to serve as auxiliary police. These men or women are trained by our regular police forces and are similarly uniformed and equipped except that they do not carry guns. The appearance on the streets of many men or women wearing the police uniform, in precincts where auxiliary police are active, has done much to reduce the crime rates in those areas. Auxiliary police serve without pay as civic minded citizens. Their presence in uniform on the streets serves to release regular uniformed police for patrol duty and lessens the neighborhood fear of crime. Auxiliary police patrol in pairs and by radio can summon instant assistance from the regular police should they encounter a situation which they have not been trained to handle. Their presence on the streets makes for good community relations between the citizens and the regular police. It is small repayment for the valuable services they render to provide them with a uniform allowance.

b. Allowance. Duly enrolled members in good standing of the auxiliary police, upon successful completion of training, shall receive an initial allowance not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars towards the initial purchase of uniforms and accessories for same, including care and maintenance. The amount of such allowance shall be determined by the police commissioner and shall not exceed the actual costs incurred for such uniforms and accessories including care and maintenance. Such members other than those receiving such initial allowance in the then current or preceding fiscal year, shall be eligible for an allowance towards the purchase of uniforms and accessories for same, including care and maintenance to be awarded to each such member who shall otherwise qualify in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision. The commissioner shall determine the amount of the allowance to be awarded based on but not limited to the member's participation, hours of service, expense incurred in maintaining uniforms and equipment and such other facts deemed pertinent by the commissioner. Payments shall be made for the preceding fiscal year after certification by the commanding officer of the auxiliary forces section to the police commissioner of such facts as the commissioner may deem pertinent to enable him or her to make his or her determination.

c. Auxiliary police not to be members of regular police force. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section nothing contained therein shall be construed to constitute such auxiliary police officers members of the regular police force or to entitle them to the privileges and benefits of the regular police force or to become members of the police pension funds.

a. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:

   1. "Bias-based profiling" means an act of a member of the force of the police department or other law enforcement officer that relies on actual or perceived race, national origin, color, creed, age, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or housing status as the determinative factor in initiating law enforcement action against an individual, rather than an individual's behavior or other information or circumstances that links a person or persons to suspected unlawful activity.

   2. "Law enforcement officer" means (i) a peace officer or police officer as defined in the Criminal Procedure Law who is employed by the city of New York; or (ii) a special patrolman appointed by the police commissioner pursuant to section 14-106 of the administrative code.

   3. The terms "national origin," "gender," "disability," "sexual orientation," and "alienage or citizenship status" shall have the same meaning as in section 8-102 of the administrative code.

   4. "Housing status" means the character of an individual's residence or lack thereof, whether publicly or privately owned, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, and shall include but not be limited to:

      (i) an individual's ownership status with regard to the individual's residence;

      (iii) an individual's use of publicly assisted housing;

      (iv) an individual's use of the shelter system; and

      (v) an individual's actual or perceived homelessness.

b. Prohibition.

   1. Every member of the police department or other law enforcement officer shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.

   2. The department shall be prohibited from engaging in bias-based profiling.

c. Private Right of Action.

   1. A claim of bias-based profiling is established under this section when an individual brings an action demonstrating that:

      (i) the governmental body has engaged in intentional bias-based profiling of one or more individuals and the governmental body fails to prove that such bias-based profiling (A) is necessary to achieve a compelling governmental interest and (B) was narrowly tailored to achieve that compelling governmental interest; or

      (ii) one or more law enforcement officers have intentionally engaged in bias-based profiling of one or more individuals; and the law enforcement officer(s) against whom such action is brought fail(s) to prove that the law enforcement action at issue was justified by a factor(s) unrelated to unlawful discrimination.

   2. A claim of bias-based profiling is also established under this section when:

      (i) a policy or practice within the police department or a group of policies or practices within the police department regarding the initiation of law enforcement action has had a disparate impact on the subjects of law enforcement action on the basis of characteristics delineated in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section, such that the policy or practice on the subjects of law enforcement action has the effect of bias-based profiling; and

      (ii) The police department fails to plead and prove as an affirmative defense that each such policy or practice bears a significant relationship to advancing a significant law enforcement objective or does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that if such person who may bring an action demonstrates that a group of policies or practices results in a disparate impact, such person shall not be required to demonstrate which specific policies or practices within the group results in such disparate impact; provided further, that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated to result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where such person who may bring an action produces substantial evidence that an alternative policy or practice with less disparate impact is available and the police department fails to prove that such alternative policy or practice would not serve the law enforcement objective as well.

      (iii) For purposes of claims brought pursuant to this paragraph, the mere existence of a statistical imbalance between the demographic composition of the subjects of the challenged law enforcement action and the general population is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation unless the general population is shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable policy or practice or group of policies or practices that allegedly causes the imbalance.

d. Enforcement.

   1. An individual subject to bias-based profiling as defined in paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section may file a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights, pursuant to Title 8 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, or may bring a civil action against (i) any governmental body that employs any law enforcement officer who has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, (ii) any law enforcement officer who has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling, and (iii) the police department where it has engaged, is engaging, or continues to engage in bias-based profiling or policies or practices that have the effect of bias-based profiling.

   2. The remedy in any civil action or administrative proceeding undertaken pursuant to this section shall be limited to injunctive and declaratory relief.

   3. In any action or proceeding to enforce this section, the court may allow a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees as part of the costs, and may include expert fees as part of the attorney's fees.

e. Preservation of rights. This section shall be in addition to all rights, procedures, and remedies available under the United States Constitution, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Constitution of the State of New York and all other federal law, state law, law of the City of New York or the New York City Administrative Code, and all pre-existing civil remedies, including monetary damages, created by statute, ordinance, regulation or common law.
