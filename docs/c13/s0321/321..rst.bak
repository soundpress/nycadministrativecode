Section 321. ::    
        
     
        §  321.  Sole  source.  a.  In  accordance  with section three hundred
      seventeen, a contract may be awarded for a good, service or construction
      without  competition  when  an  agency  determines,  pursuant  to  rules
      promulgated  by  the  procurement  policy  board, that there is only one
      source for the  required  good,  service  or  construction.  The  agency
      contract  file  shall  contain  the  agency's  determination that only a
      single  source  is  available  for  the  required   good,   service   or
      construction,  including  the  process  by  which  the  agency made such
      determination.  Copies  of  such  notice  shall  be   filed   with   the
      comptroller.
        b.  Whenever  an  agency determines that there is only a single source
      for a good, service or construction,  an  agency  shall  give  immediate
      notice in the City Record of such determination and shall in such notice
      solicit  the  application  of  vendors  qualified  to provide such good,
      service or construction, or interested in providing such good service or
      construction in the future. The procurement policy board shall  by  rule
      define  the  timing  and  duration  of  such notification to ensure that
      vendors qualified to provide such good,  service  or  construction  have
      sufficient  opportunity to express their interest to the agency prior to
      the initiation of any sole source negotiation; provided,  however,  that
      if  the  agency  has  determined that it should not reveal to the vendor
      with whom it is negotiating that it is doing so on a sole  source  basis
      under circumstances defined by rule of the procurement policy board, the
      notice required by this subdivision shall be made upon the completion of
      such  negotiations  or  the award of the contract. Vendors interested in
      providing such good, service or construction  in  the  future  shall  be
      prequalified  in  accordance  with section three hundred twenty-four, or
      shall be included for receipt of notice in accordance with subdivision a
      of section three hundred twenty-five.
