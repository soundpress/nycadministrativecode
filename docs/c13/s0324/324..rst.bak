Section 324. ::    
        
     
        §   324.   Prequalification.   a.   Agencies  may  maintain  lists  of
      prequalified vendors and  entry  into  a  prequalified  group  shall  be
      continuously  available.  Prospective  vendors  may  be  prequalified as
      contractors for the provision of particular types of goods, services and
      construction, in accordance with general criteria established by rule of
      the procurement policy board which may include, but shall not be limited
      to,  the  experience,  past  performance,  ability  to  undertake  work,
      financial  capability,  responsibility,  and  reliability of prospective
      bidders, and which may be supplemented by criteria established  by  rule
      of  the  agency for the prequalification of vendors for particular types
      of goods, services or construction or by criteria published in the  City
      Record  by  the  agency  prior  to the prequalification of vendors for a
      particular procurement.  Such  prequalification  may  be  by  categories
      designated by size and other factors.
        b. Any vendor who is denied prequalification or whose prequalification
      is  revoked  by an agency may appeal such decision to the agency head. A
      determination of an agency  head  may  be  appealed  to  the  office  of
      administrative  trials  and hearings for a hearing and such office shall
      take final action regarding such matter. A  decision  by  an  agency  to
      suspend  a vendor's prequalification may be appealed to the agency head,
      provided that if such suspension extends for more than three  months  it
      shall be deemed a revocation of the prequalification for the purposes of
      this section.
