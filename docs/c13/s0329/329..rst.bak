        §  329. By whom procured. a. All services to be performed by contract,
      including the furnishing of goods incident thereto, shall be obtained by
      the agency for whose use the  appropriation  therefor  shall  have  been
      made,  except as otherwise provided by law or by rule of the procurement
      policy board.
        b. All other goods shall be purchased or procured by the department of
      citywide administrative services, except as otherwise provided  pursuant
      to this chapter or other law.
        c.  Pursuant  to  rules of the procurement policy board and subject to
      other sections of this chapter, each agency may purchase directly  goods
      in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars for each transaction or,
      with  the  prior approval of the commissioner of citywide administrative
      services, in an amount not to exceed  five  thousand  dollars  for  each
      transaction.  The  limitation  of  this  subdivision  shall not apply to
      purchases by an agency under a  vendor  contract  entered  into  by  the
      commissioner of citywide administrative services.
        d.  The  dollar  limits  for direct agency purchases without the prior
      approval  of  the  commissioner  of  citywide  administrative   services
      pursuant to subdivision c of this section may be raised to five thousand
      dollars for each transaction for any or all agencies by the commissioner
      of  citywide administrative services with the approval of the mayor. Any
      proposed increases in the limits for such purchases above five  thousand
      dollars shall be subject to the further approval of the comptroller. Any
      increase  in  dollar  limits  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  shall  be
      published in the City Record and may be rescinded by the commissioner of
      citywide administrative services, the mayor, or the comptroller.
        e. Subject to the approval of the comptroller, a specific  procurement
      of  a  specific  good  may  be delegated by the commissioner of citywide
      administrative services, in the best interest of the city, to any agency
      for direct purchase by such agency, and shall  not  be  subject  to  the
      provisions of subdivisions b, c or d of this section; provided, however,
      that  such  delegation  shall  not  be  made  for  goods  that are to be
      generally used by city agencies.
