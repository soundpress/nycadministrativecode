Section 851. ::    
        
     
        §  851.  Constitution  and  appointment.  a.  There  shall  be  an art
      commission the members of which shall be the mayor, who  may  appoint  a
      person to represent him and replace such representative at his pleasure,
      the  president  of  the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the president of the
      New York Public Library  (Astor,  Lenox  and  Tilden  foundations),  the
      president  of  the  Brooklyn  Museum,  one  painter,  one  sculptor, one
      architect, and one landscape architect, all of whom shall  be  residents
      of  the city, and three other residents of the city no one of whom shall
      be a painter, sculptor, architect, landscape architect or active  member
      of any other profession in the fine arts.
        b.  All the members of the commission shall serve without compensation
      for their service on the commission.  Those  whose  service  is  not  ex
      officio  shall  be  appointed  by the mayor from a list of not less than
      three times the number to be appointed, such list to be submitted by the
      Fine Arts Federation of New York. In case the Fine Arts Federation shall
      fail to present a list of nominees within three  months  from  the  time
      when  a vacancy occurs, the mayor shall appoint without such nomination.
      In case the mayor shall fail to appoint within one year  from  the  time
      when  a  vacancy  occurs, such vacancy shall be filled by the commission
      for any balance of the unexpired term.
        c. In all matters which come before the commission pertaining to  work
      under  the  special charge of an agency, the head of such agency may act
      as a member of the commission. Each president of an institution  who  is
      an ex officio member may, by a writing filed with the executive director
      of  the  commission, appoint a trustee of the institution of which he is
      president to serve in his  place  as  member  of  the  commission.  Such
      appointment  shall  be revocable at any time by such president and shall
      terminate whenever he ceases to be president.
