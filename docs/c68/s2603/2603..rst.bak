Section 2603. ::    
        
     
        §  2603.  Powers and obligations. a. Rules. The board shall promulgate
      rules as are necessary to implement and interpret the provisions of this
      chapter, consistent with the goal of providing clear guidance  regarding
      prohibited  conduct.  The  board,  by  rule, shall once every four years
      adjust the dollar amount established in subdivision sixteen  of  section
      twenty-six  hundred  one  of  this  chapter  to  reflect  changes in the
      consumer price index for the metropolitan  New  York-New  Jersey  region
      published by the United States bureau of labor statistics.
        b.  Training and education. 1. The board shall have the responsibility
      of informing public servants and assisting their  understanding  of  the
      conflicts  of  interest  provisions  of this chapter. In fulfilling this
      responsibility, the board shall develop educational materials  regarding
      the  conflicts of interest provisions and related interpretive rules and
      shall develop and administer an on-going program for  the  education  of
      public servants regarding the provisions of this chapter.
        2.  (a)  The  board  shall  make  information  concerning this chapter
      available and known to all public servants. On or before the  tenth  day
      after  an individual becomes a public servant, such public servant shall
      be provided with a copy  of  this  chapter  and  shall  sign  a  written
      statement,  which shall be maintained in his or her personnel file, that
      such public servant has received and read and  shall  conform  with  the
      provisions of this chapter.
        (b)  Each  public servant shall undergo training provided by the board
      in the provisions of this chapter on or before the sixtieth day after he
      or she becomes a public servant, and periodically as appropriate  during
      the  course  of  his  or  her city service. Every two years, each agency
      shall develop and implement  an  appropriate  agency  training  plan  in
      consultation  with  the board and the mayor's office of operations. Each
      agency shall cooperate with the board in order to ensure that all public
      servants in the agency receive the training required by this subdivision
      and shall maintain records  documenting  such  training  and  the  dates
      thereof.  The  training  required  by this subdivision may be in person,
      provided either by the board itself or by agency  personnel  working  in
      conjunction  with  the board, or through an automated or online training
      program developed by the board.
        (c) The failure of a public servant to receive the  training  required
      by  this  paragraph,  to  receive a copy of this chapter, or to sign the
      statement required by this paragraph, or the failure of  the  agency  to
      maintain the required statement on file or record of training completed,
      shall  have  no effect on the duty of such public servant to comply with
      this chapter or on the enforcement of the provisions thereof.
        c. Advisory opinions. 1. The board shall render advisory opinions with
      respect to all matters covered by  this  chapter.  An  advisory  opinion
      shall  be  rendered  on the request of a public servant or a supervisory
      official of a public  servant  and  shall  apply  only  to  such  public
      servant.  The request shall be in such form as the board may require and
      shall be signed by the person making the request.  The  opinion  of  the
      board  shall  be  based on such facts as are presented in the request or
      subsequently submitted in a written, signed document.
        2. Advisory opinions shall be issued only  with  respect  to  proposed
      future  conduct  or  action  by a public servant. A public servant whose
      conduct or action is the subject of an advisory  opinion  shall  not  be
      subject  to penalties or sanctions by virtue of acting or failing to act
      due to a reasonable reliance on the opinion, unless material facts  were
      omitted  or misstated in the request for an opinion. The board may amend
      a previously issued advisory opinion after giving reasonable  notice  to
      the  public  servant that it is reconsidering its opinion; provided that
    
      such amended advisory opinion shall apply  only  to  future  conduct  or
      action of the public servant.
        3.  The  board  shall  make  public  its  advisory  opinions with such
      deletions as may be necessary to prevent disclosure of the indentity  of
      any public servant or other involved party. The advisory opinions of the
      board  shall  be  indexed by subject matter and cross-indexed by charter
      section and rule number and such index shall be maintained on an  annual
      and cumulative basis.
        4. Not later than the first day of September, nineteen hundred ninety,
      the  board  shall initiate a rulemaking to adopt, as interpretive of the
      provisions of this chapter, any advisory opinions of the board of ethics
      constituted pursuant to chapter sixty-eight of the charter heretofore in
      effect, which the board determines to be consistent  with  and  to  have
      interpretive value in construing the provisions of this chapter.
        5.  For  the  purposes  of this subdivision, public servant includes a
      prospective and  former  public  servant,  and  a  supervisory  official
      includes a supervisory official who shall supervise a prospective public
      servant  and  a  supervisory  official  who  supervised  a former public
      servant.
        d.  Financial  disclosure.  1.  All  financial  disclosure  statements
      required  to be completed and filed by public servants pursuant to state
      or local law shall be filed by such public servants with the board.
        2. The board shall cause each statement filed with it to  be  examined
      to  determine  if  there  has  been  compliance  with the applicable law
      concerning financial disclosure and  to  determine  if  there  has  been
      compliance with or violations of the provisions of this chapter.
        3.  The  board  shall  issue  rules concerning the filing of financial
      disclosure statements for the purpose of ensuring compliance by the city
      and all public servants with  the  applicable  provisions  of  financial
      disclosure law.
        e.   Complaints.  1.  The  board  shall  receive  complaints  alleging
      violations of this chapter.
        2. Whenever a written complaint is received by the board, it shall:
        (a) dismiss the complaint if it determines that no further  action  is
      required by the board; or
        (b)  refer  the  complaint  to  the  commissioner  of investigation if
      further investigation is required for the board to determine what action
      is appropriate; or
        (c) make an initial determination that  there  is  probable  cause  to
      believe  that a public servant has violated a provision of this chapter;
      or
        (d) refer an alleged violation of this chapter  to  the  head  of  the
      agency served by the public servant, if the board deems the violation to
      be  minor  or  if  related  disciplinary charges are pending against the
      public servant.
        3. For the purposes of this subdivision, a public servant  includes  a
      former public servant.
        f.  Investigations.  1.  The  board shall have the power to direct the
      department of investigation to conduct an investigation  of  any  matter
      related   to  the  board's  responsibilities  under  this  chapter.  The
      commissioner  of  investigation  shall,  within   a   reasonable   time,
      investigate  any such matter and submit a confidential written report of
      factual findings to the board.
        2. The commissioner of investigation shall make a confidential  report
      to  the board concerning the results of all investigations which involve
      or may involve violations of the provisions of this chapter, whether  or
      not such investigations were made at the request of the board.
    
        g.  Referral  of  matters within the board's jurisdiction. 1. A public
      servant or supervisory official of such public servant may  request  the
      board  to  review  and  make a determination regarding a past or ongoing
      action of such public servant. Such request shall be reviewed and  acted
      upon  by  the  board  in  the same manner as a complaint received by the
      board under subdivision e of this section.
        2. Whenever an agency receives a complaint  alleging  a  violation  of
      this  chapter  or  determines  that a violation of this chapter may have
      occurred, it shall refer such matter to the board. Such  referral  shall
      be  reviewed  and  acted  upon  by  the  board  in  the same manner as a
      complaint received by the board under subdivision e of this section.
        3. For the purposes of this subdivision,  public  servant  includes  a
      former public servant, and a supervisory official includes a supervisory
      official who supervised a former public servant.
        h.  Hearings. 1. If the board makes an initial determination, based on
      a complaint, investigation or other information available to the  board,
      that  there  is  probable  cause  to believe that the public servant has
      violated a provision of this chapter, the board shall notify the  public
      servant  of  its  determination  in  writing. The notice shall contain a
      statement of the facts upon which the board relied for its determination
      of probable cause and a statement of the  provisions  of  law  allegedly
      violated.  The board shall also inform the public servant of the board's
      procedural rules. Such public servant shall have a  reasonable  time  to
      respond,  either  orally  or  in writing, and shall have the right to be
      represented by counsel or any other person.
        2. If, after receipt of  the  public  servant's  response,  the  board
      determines  that  there is no probable cause to believe that a violation
      has occurred, the board shall dismiss the matter and inform  the  public
      servant  in  writing of its decision. If, after the consideration of the
      response by the public  servant,  the  board  determines  there  remains
      probable  cause  to  believe  that a violation of the provisions of this
      chapter has occurred, the board shall hold or direct  a  hearing  to  be
      held  on the record to determine whether such violation has occurred, or
      shall refer the matter to the appropriate agency if the  public  servant
      is subject to the jurisdiction of any state law or collective bargaining
      agreement  which  provides  for the conduct of disciplinary proceedings,
      provided that when such a matter is referred to an  agency,  the  agency
      shall consult with the board before issuing a final decision.
        3.  If  the board determines, after a hearing or the opportunity for a
      hearing, that a public servant has violated provisions of this  chapter,
      it  shall,  after  consultation  with  the  head of the agency served or
      formerly served by the public servant, or in the case of an agency head,
      with the mayor, issue an order either imposing such  penalties  provided
      for  by  this  chapter  as  it  deems  appropriate, or recommending such
      penalties to the head of the agency served or  formerly  served  by  the
      public  servant,  or  in  the  case  of  an  agency  head, to the mayor;
      provided, however, that the board shall  not  impose  penalties  against
      members of the council, or public servants employed by the council or by
      members  of the council, but may recommend to the council such penalties
      as it deems appropriate. The order shall include findings  of  fact  and
      conclusions  of  law.  When  a  penalty  is recommended, the head of the
      agency or the council shall report to the board what action was taken.
        4. Hearings of the board shall not be public unless requested  by  the
      public servant. The order and the board's findings and conclusions shall
      be made public.
        5.  The  board  shall  maintain an index of all persons found to be in
      violation of this chapter, by name, office and date of order. The  index
    
      and  the determinations of probable cause and orders in such cases shall
      be made available for public inspection and copying.
        6.  Nothing  contained  in  this section shall prohibit the appointing
      officer of a public servant from terminating or  otherwise  disciplining
      such   public  servant,  where  such  appointing  officer  is  otherwise
      authorized to  do  so;  provided,  however,  that  such  action  by  the
      appointing  officer  shall  not  preclude  the board from exercising its
      powers and duties under this chapter with respect to the actions of  any
      such public servant.
        7. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term public servant shall
      include a former public servant.
        i. Annual report. The board shall submit an annual report to the mayor
      and  the  council  in  accordance with section eleven hundred and six of
      this charter. The report shall include a summary of the proceedings  and
      activities  of  the  board,  a description of the education and training
      conducted pursuant to the requirements of this  chapter,  a  statistical
      summary  and  evaluation  of complaints and referrals received and their
      disposition, such legislative and administrative recommendations as  the
      board  deems  appropriate,  the  rules  of  the  board, and the index of
      opinions and orders of that  year.  The  report,  which  shall  be  made
      available  to  the  public,  shall  not  contain  information, which, if
      disclosed, would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of  a
      public servant.
        j. Revision. The board shall review the provisions of this chapter and
      shall  recommend  to  the  council  from  time  to  time such changes or
      additions as it may consider appropriate or desirable. Such  review  and
      recommendation shall be made at least once every five years.
        k. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the records, reports,
      memoranda  and files of the board shall be confidential and shall not be
      subject to public scrutiny.
