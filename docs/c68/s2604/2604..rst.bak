Section 2604. ::    
        
     
        §  2604.  Prohibited interests and conduct. a. Prohibited interests in
      firms engaged in business dealings with the city.
        1. Except as provided in paragraph three below,
        (a) no public servant shall have an interest  in  a  firm  which  such
      public  servant  knows  is  engaged in business dealings with the agency
      served by such public  servant;  provided,  however,  that,  subject  to
      paragraph one of subdivision b of this section, an appointed member of a
      community  board  shall  not  be prohibited from having an interest in a
      firm which may be affected by an action on a matter before the community
      or borough board, and
        (b) no regular employee shall have an interest in a  firm  which  such
      regular  employee  knows  is engaged in business dealings with the city,
      except if such interest is in a firm whose shares are  publicly  traded,
      as defined by rule of the board.
        2.  Prior to acquiring or accepting an interest in a firm whose shares
      are publicly traded, a public servant may submit a  written  request  to
      the  head of the agency served by the public servant for a determination
      of whether such firm is engaged in business dealings with  such  agency.
      Such  determination shall be in writing, shall be rendered expeditiously
      and shall be binding on the city and the public servant with respect  to
      the prohibition of subparagraph a of paragraph one of this subdivision.
        3.  An  individual  who,  prior  to  becoming a public servant, has an
      ownership interest which would be prohibited by paragraph one above;  or
      a  public  servant  who  has an ownership interest and did not know of a
      business dealing which would cause the interest to be one prohibited  by
      paragraph  one  above,  but  has  subsequently  gained knowledge of such
      business dealing; or a public servant who holds  an  ownership  interest
      which,  subsequent  to the public servant's acquisition of the interest,
      enters into a business dealing which would cause the ownership  interest
      to be one prohibited by paragraph one above; or a public servant who, by
      operation   of  law,  obtains  an  ownership  interest  which  would  be
      prohibited by paragraph one above shall,  prior  to  becoming  a  public
      servant  or,  if already a public servant, within ten days of knowing of
      the business dealing, either:
        (a) divest the ownership interest; or
        (b) disclose to the board such ownership interest and comply with  its
      order.
        4.  When  an individual or public servant discloses an interest to the
      board pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision, the  board  shall
      issue an order setting forth its determination as to whether or not such
      interest,  if maintained, would be in conflict with the proper discharge
      of the public servant's official duties. In making  such  determination,
      the  board  shall  take  into account the nature of the public servant's
      official duties, the manner in which the interest may be affected by any
      action of the city, and the appearance of conflict to the public. If the
      board determines a conflict exists,  the  board's  order  shall  require
      divestiture  or  such  other  action  as  it deems appropriate which may
      mitigate such a conflict, taking into account the  financial  burden  of
      any decision on the public servant.
        5. For the purposes of this subdivision, the agency served by
        (a)  an elected official, other than a member of the council, shall be
      the executive branch of the city government,
        (b) a public servant who is a deputy mayor, the director of the office
      of  management  and  budget,  commissioner  of  citywide  administrative
      services,  corporation counsel, commissioner of finance, commissioner of
      investigation or chair of the city planning commission, or who serves in
      the executive branch of city government and is charged with  substantial
    
      policy discretion involving city-wide policy as determined by the board,
      shall be the executive branch of the city government,
        (c)  a  public servant designated by a member of the board of estimate
      to act in the place of such member as a member of the board of estimate,
      shall include the board of estimate, and
        (d) a member of the council shall be the  legislative  branch  of  the
      city government.
        6.  For  the  purposes  of  subdivisions a and b of section twenty-six
      hundred six, a public servant shall be deemed  to  know  of  a  business
      dealing  with  the city if such public servant should have known of such
      business dealing with the city.
        b. Prohibited conduct. 1. A public servant who has an  interest  in  a
      firm which is not prohibited by subdivision a of this section, shall not
      take  any  action  as  a  public  servant  particularly  affecting  that
      interest, except that
        (a) in the case of an elected  official,  such  action  shall  not  be
      prohibited,  but the elected official shall disclose the interest to the
      conflicts of interest board, and on the official records of the  council
      or the board of estimate in the case of matters before those bodies,
        (b)  in  the  case of an appointed community board member, such action
      shall not be prohibited, but no member may vote on any matter before the
      community or borough board which may result in  a  personal  and  direct
      economic  gain  to  the  member  or  any  person with whom the member is
      associated, and
        (c) in the case of all other public servants, if the interest is  less
      than  ten thousand dollars, such action shall not be prohibited, but the
      public servant shall disclose the interest to the board.
        2. No public servant shall engage  in  any  business,  transaction  or
      private  employment,  or  have  any financial or other private interest,
      direct or indirect, which is in conflict with the  proper  discharge  of
      his or her official duties.
        3.  No  public servant shall use or attempt to use his or her position
      as a public servant to obtain any  financial  gain,  contract,  license,
      privilege  or  other  private or personal advantage, direct or indirect,
      for the public servant or any person or firm associated with the  public
      servant.
        4.  No  public  servant  shall  disclose  any confidential information
      concerning the property, affairs or government  of  the  city  which  is
      obtained  as  a result of the official duties of such public servant and
      which is not  otherwise  available  to  the  public,  or  use  any  such
      information to advance any direct or indirect financial or other private
      interest of the public servant or of any other person or firm associated
      with the public servant; provided, however, that this shall not prohibit
      any  public  servant  from disclosing any information concerning conduct
      which the public servant knows or reasonably believes to involve  waste,
      inefficiency, corruption, criminal activity or conflict of interest.
        5.  No  public  servant  shall accept any valuable gift, as defined by
      rule of the board, from any person or firm  which  such  public  servant
      knows  is  or  intends  to  become engaged in business dealings with the
      city, except that nothing  contained  herein  shall  prohibit  a  public
      servant  from  accepting  a gift which is customary on family and social
      occasions.
        6. No  public  servant  shall,  for  compensation,  represent  private
      interests  before  any  city  agency or appear directly or indirectly on
      behalf of private interests in matters involving the city. For a  public
      servant who is not a regular employee, this prohibition shall apply only
      to the agency served by the public servant.
    
        7.  No  public servant shall appear as attorney or counsel against the
      interests of the city in any litigation to which the city is a party, or
      in any action or proceeding in which the city, or any public servant  of
      the  city,  acting  in  the course of official duties, is a complainant,
      provided  that  this  paragraph  shall  not  apply  to  a public servant
      employed by an elected official who appears as attorney or  counsel  for
      that  elected  official in any litigation, action or proceeding in which
      the elected official has standing and authority to participate by virtue
      of his or her capacity as an elected official, including any part  of  a
      litigation,  action  or  proceeding  prior  to  or  at which standing or
      authority to participate is determined. This paragraph shall not in  any
      way  be  construed  to  expand or limit the standing or authority of any
      elected official to participate in any litigation, action or proceeding,
      nor shall it in any way affect the powers and duties of the  corporation
      counsel.  For  a  public  servant  who  is  not a regular employee, this
      prohibition shall apply only to the agency served by the public servant.
        8. No public servant shall give opinion  evidence  as  a  paid  expert
      against  the interests of the city in any civil litigation brought by or
      against the city. For a public servant who is not  a  regular  employee,
      this  prohibition  shall  apply  only to the agency served by the public
      servant.
        9. No public servant shall,
        (a)  coerce  or  attempt  to  coerce,  by  intimidation,  threats   or
      otherwise, any public servant to engage in political activities, or
        (b)  request  any  subordinate  public  servant  to  participate  in a
      political campaign. For purposes of this subparagraph, participation  in
      a  political campaign shall include managing or aiding in the management
      of a campaign, soliciting votes or canvassing voters  for  a  particular
      candidate  or  performing  any  similar  acts which are unrelated to the
      public servant's duties or responsibilities.  Nothing  contained  herein
      shall  prohibit  a  public  servant from requesting a subordinate public
      servant to speak on behalf of a candidate,  or  provide  information  or
      perform  other  similar acts, if such acts are related to matters within
      the public servant's duties or responsibilities.
        10. No public servant shall give or promise to give any portion of the
      public servant's compensation, or any money, or valuable  thing  to  any
      person  in  consideration  of having been or being nominated, appointed,
      elected or employed as a public servant.
        11. No public servant shall, directly of indirectly,
        (a) compel,  induce  or  request  any  person  to  pay  any  political
      assessment,  subscription  or contribution, under threat of prejudice to
      or promise of or to secure advantage  in  rank,  compensation  or  other
      job-related status or function,
        (b)  pay  or  promise to pay any political assessment, subscription or
      contribution in consideration of having been or being nominated, elected
      or employed as such public servant  or  to  secure  advantage  in  rank,
      compensation or other job-related status or function, or
        (c)  compel,  induce  or request any subordinate public servant to pay
      any political assessment, subscription or contribution.
        12. No public servant, other than an elected official, who is a deputy
      mayor, or head of an agency or who is charged  with  substantial  policy
      discretion as defined by rule of the board, shall directly or indirectly
      request any person to make or pay any political assessment, subscription
      or  contribution for any candidate for an elective office of the city or
      for any elected official who is a candidate  for  any  elective  office;
      provided  that nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed to
      prohibit such public  servant  from  speaking  on  behalf  of  any  such
      candidate  or  elected  official  at  an  occasion where a request for a
    
      political assessment,  subscription  or  contribution  may  be  made  by
      others.
        13.  No public servant shall receive compensation except from the city
      for performing any official duty or accept or receive any gratuity  from
      any  person  whose  interests  may  be  affected by the public servant's
      official action.
        14. No public servant shall  enter  into  any  business  or  financial
      relationship   with   another  public  servant  who  is  a  superior  or
      subordinate of such public servant.
        15. No elected  official,  deputy  mayor,  deputy  to  a  citywide  or
      boroughwide elected official, head of an agency, or other public servant
      who  is charged with substantial policy discretion as defined by rule of
      the board may be a member of  the  national  or  state  committee  of  a
      political  party,  serve  as  an assembly district leader of a political
      party or serve as the chair or as an officer of the county committee  or
      county executive committee of a political party, except that a member of
      the  council may serve as an assembly district leader or hold any lesser
      political office as defined by rule of the board.
        c. This section shall not prohibit:
        1. an elected official from appearing without compensation before  any
      city  agency  on  behalf of constituents or in the performance of public
      official or civic obligations;
        2. a public  servant  from  accepting  or  receiving  any  benefit  or
      facility  which  is  provided  for  or  made  available  to  citizens or
      residents, or classes of citizens or residents, under housing  or  other
      general welfare legislation or in the exercise of the police power;
        3.  a  public  servant  from  obtaining  a  loan  from  any  financial
      institution upon terms  and  conditions  available  to  members  of  the
      public;
        4.   any  physician,  dentist,  optometrist,  podiatrist,  pharmacist,
      chiropractor or other person who is  eligible  to  provide  services  or
      supplies  under  title eleven of article five of the social services law
      and is  receiving  any  salary  or  other  compensation  from  the  city
      treasury,  from  providing professional services and supplies to persons
      who are entitled to benefits under such title,  provided  that,  in  the
      case of services or supplies provided by those who perform audit, review
      or  other  administrative  functions  pursuant to the provisions of such
      title, the New York state department  of  health  reviews  and  approves
      payment for such services or supplies and provided further that there is
      no  conflict with their official duties; nothing in this paragraph shall
      be construed to authorize payment to such persons under such  title  for
      services  or supplies furnished in the course of their employment by the
      city;
        5. any member of the uniformed force of  the  police  department  from
      being  employed in the private security field, provided that such member
      has received approval from the  police  commissioner  therefor  and  has
      complied  with  all  rules  and  regulations  promulgated  by the police
      commissioner relating to such employment;
        6. a public servant from acting as attorney, agent, broker,  employee,
      officer,  director  or consultant for any not-for-profit corporation, or
      association, or other such entity which  operates  on  a  not-for-profit
      basis, interested in business dealings with the city, provided that:
        (a)  such  public  servant  takes  no  direct or indirect part in such
      business dealings;
        (b) such not-for-profit entity has no direct or indirect  interest  in
      any  business  dealings with the city agency in which the public servant
      is employed and is not subject to supervision, control or regulation  by
      such  agency, except where it is determined by the head of an agency, or
    
      by the mayor where the public servant  is  an  agency  head,  that  such
      activity is in furtherance of the purposes and interests of the city;
        (c)  all  such activities by such public servant shall be performed at
      times during which  the  public  servant  is  not  required  to  perform
      services for the city; and
        (d)  such  public  servant receives no salary or other compensation in
      connection with such activities;
        7. a public servant, other than elected officials,  employees  in  the
      office  of property management of the department of housing preservation
      and development, employees in the department of citywide  administrative
      services  who  are  designated  by  the  commissioner of such department
      pursuant to this paragraph, and the commissioners, deputy commissioners,
      assistant  commissioners  and  others  of  equivalent  ranks   in   such
      departments,  or the successors to such departments, from bidding on and
      purchasing any city-owned real property at public auction or sealed  bid
      sale,  or from purchasing any city-owned residential building containing
      six or less dwelling units through negotiated sale, provided  that  such
      public servant, in the course of city employment, did not participate in
      decisions  or  matters affecting the disposition of the city property to
      be purchased and has no such matters  under  active  consideration.  The
      commissioner  of  citywide  administrative  services shall designate all
      employees of the department of citywide  administrative  services  whose
      functions relate to citywide real property matters to be subject to this
      paragraph; or
        8.  a  public  servant  from participating in collective bargaining or
      from paying union or shop fees or dues or, if such public servant  is  a
      union  member,  from  requesting  a  subordinate public servant who is a
      member of such union to contribute to union political action  committees
      or other similar entities.
        d.  Post-employment  restrictions. 1. No public servant shall solicit,
      negotiate for or accept any position (i) from which, after leaving  city
      service,   the   public   servant   would  be  disqualified  under  this
      subdivision, or (ii) with any person or firm who or which is involved in
      a particular matter with the city, while such public servant is actively
      considering, or is directly concerned  or  personally  participating  in
      such particular matter on behalf of the city.
        2.  No  former public servant shall, within a period of one year after
      termination of such person's service with the city,  appear  before  the
      city  agency  served  by  such  public  servant; provided, however, that
      nothing contained herein shall be deemed to  prohibit  a  former  public
      servant  from making communications with the agency served by the public
      servant which are incidental to an otherwise permitted appearance in  an
      adjudicative  proceeding  before  another  agency  or  body, or a court,
      unless the proceeding was pending in the agency served during the period
      of the public servant's service with that agency. For  the  purposes  of
      this  paragraph,  the  agency served by a public servant designated by a
      member of the board of estimate to act in the place of such member as  a
      member of the board of estimate, shall include the board of estimate.
        3.  No  elected  official,  nor  the  holder of the position of deputy
      mayor, director of the office of management and budget, commissioner  of
      citywide  administrative  services, corporation counsel, commissioner of
      finance, commissioner of investigation or chair  of  the  city  planning
      commission  shall, within a period of one year after termination of such
      person's employment with the city,  appear  before  any  agency  in  the
      branch  of  city  government  served by such person. For the purposes of
      this paragraph, the legislative branch  of  the  city  consists  of  the
      council  and the offices of the council, and the executive branch of the
    
      city consists of all other agencies of the city, including the office of
      the public advocate.
        4.  No person who has served as a public servant shall appear, whether
      paid or unpaid,  before  the  city,  or  receive  compensation  for  any
      services  rendered,  in  relation to any particular matter involving the
      same party or parties with  respect  to  which  particular  matter  such
      person had participated personally and substantially as a public servant
      through  decision,  approval,  recommendation,  investigation  or  other
      similar activities.
        5. No public servant shall, after leaving city  service,  disclose  or
      use  for  private  advantage  any  confidential  information gained from
      public service which is not otherwise  made  available  to  the  public;
      provided,  however, that this shall not prohibit any public servant from
      disclosing any information concerning conduct which the  public  servant
      knows or reasonably believes to involve waste, inefficiency, corruption,
      criminal activity or conflict of interest.
        6.  The  prohibitions  on negotiating for and having certain positions
      after leaving city  service,  shall  not  apply  to  positions  with  or
      representation on behalf of any local, state or federal agency.
        7.  Nothing  contained  in  this  subdivision  shall prohibit a former
      public servant from being associated with or having a position in a firm
      which appears before a city agency  or  from  acting  in  a  ministerial
      matter regarding business dealings with the city.
        e.  Allowed  positions.  A public servant or former public servant may
      hold or negotiate for a position otherwise prohibited by  this  section,
      where  the  holding  of  the  position would not be in conflict with the
      purposes and interests of the city, if, after written  approval  by  the
      head  of  the agency or agencies involved, the board determines that the
      position involves no such conflict. Such findings shall  be  in  writing
      and made public by the board.
