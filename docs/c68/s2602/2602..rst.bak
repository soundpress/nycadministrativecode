      forty-five days of receipt  of  such  nomination  from  the  mayor,  the
      nomination shall be deemed to be confirmed.
        f.  Members  may  be  removed  by the mayor for substantial neglect of
      duty, gross misconduct in office, inability to discharge the  powers  or
      duties  of office or violation of this section, after written notice and

        g. The board shall appoint a counsel to  serve  at  its  pleasure  and
      shall employ or retain such other officers, employees and consultants as
      are  necessary  to  exercise its powers and fulfill its obligations. The
      authority of the counsel shall be  defined  in  writing,  provided  that
