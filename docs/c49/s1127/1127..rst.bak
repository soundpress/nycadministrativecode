        §  1127.  Condition  precedent  to  employment. a. Notwithstanding the
      provisions of any local law, rule or regulation to the  contrary,  every
      person  seeking  employment  with  the  city  of  New York or any of its
      agencies regardless of civil service classification or status shall sign
      an agreement as a condition precedent to such employment to  the  effect
      that  if such person is or becomes a nonresident individual as that term
      is defined in section 11-1706 of the administrative code of the city  of
      New York or any similar provision of such code, during employment by the
      city,  such  person  will  pay  to  the  city  an amount by which a city
      personal income tax on residents computed  and  determined  as  if  such
      person  were  a  resident individual, as defined in such section, during
      such employment, exceeds the amount of any city earnings  tax  and  city
      personal income tax imposed on such person for the same taxable period.
        b.  Whenever any provision of this charter, the administrative code of
      the city of New York or any rule or regulation promulgated  pursuant  to
      such   charter   or  administrative  code  employs  the  term  "salary",
      "compensation", or any other word or words  having  a  similar  meaning,
      such terms shall be deemed and construed to mean the scheduled salary or
      compensation  of  any  employee of the city of New York, undiminished by
      any amount payable pursuant to subdivision a of this section.
