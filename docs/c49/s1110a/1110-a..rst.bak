        § 1110-a. Capital plant inventory and maintenance estimates.
        a. For the purposes of this section:
        1. "Maintenance" or "maintain" shall denote those activities necessary
      to  keep  the relevant portion of the capital plant in good repair so as
      to preserve its structural integrity and to prevent its deterioration.
        2. "Major portion of the capital plant" shall  mean  (a)  any  capital
      asset  (1)  which is a capital facility or system comprising a component
      of the public domain or infrastructure general fixed assets of the  city
      or  a building comprising a component of the general fixed assets of the
      city and (2)  which,  as  of  December  thirty-first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight, or, as the result of any reconstruction or expansion after
      such  date, has a replacement cost of at least ten million dollars and a
      useful life of at least ten years, or if purchased or constructed  after
      such  date, has an original cost of at least ten million dollars, and an
      original useful life of at least ten years; and (b)  any  other  capital
      asset  of  the  city  designated  by  the mayor for the purposes of this
      section; provided, however, that it shall not include any asset which is
      leased to or otherwise under the cognizance  and  control  of  a  public
      benefit  corporation  or  which  is otherwise covered, pursuant to state
      law, by requirements which are substantially similar to the requirements
      of this section.
        b. Not later than October first of nineteen hundred  eighty-nine,  the
      head of each agency shall submit to the mayor, for each major portion of
      the  capital  plant  for  which  the  agency  or any officer or employee
      thereof is responsible, the following information: the date of  original
      acquisition or construction, the dates of any significant alterations or
      reconstructions,  the  original  cost  and original useful life, and the
      current replacement cost and remaining  useful  life.  Such  information
      shall be categorized by project type.
        c.  Not  later than October first of nineteen hundred ninety, the head
      of each agency shall  submit  to  the  mayor  an  agency  capital  plant
      inventory  presenting,  for  each major portion of the capital plant for
      which the agency or any officer or employee thereof is  responsible,  an
      update  of  the information required by subdivision b of this section as
      well as an assessment of its condition  and  a  schedule,  by  year,  of
      maintenance  activities. The head of each agency shall submit amendments
      of such agency capital plant inventory to  the  mayor  as  necessary  to
      ensure  that  such  inventory,  including  the condition assessments and
      maintenance schedules, is complete, current and accurate. Such inventory
      and amendments thereto shall be categorized by project type.
        d. Such maintenance  schedules  and  amendments  thereto,  other  than
      amendments reflecting the dispostion or demolition of any portion of the
      capital  plant,  shall be prepared or reviewed by professional engineers
      or architects registered in the state of New York and such engineers  or
      architects  shall  set  forth  in  writing  (1) their opinions as to the
      reasonableness and sufficiency of  the  activities  set  forth  in  such
      schedules  for  maintaining  such  portions of the capital plant and (2)
      their recommendations, if any,  for  changes  in  such  schedules.  Such
      opinions and recommendations shall be based upon commonly used standards
      for   acceptable  levels  of  maintenance,  the  performance  and  other
      specifications  to  which  such  portions  of  the  capital  plant  were
      designed,  and  such other engineering or architectural standards as may
      be  appropriate.  Such  professional  engineers  or  architects  may  be
      officers or employees of the city of New York.
        e.  The  mayor  shall  transmit  copies  of  such agency capital plant
      inventories, and all amendments thereto, to the council, the comptroller
      and the city planning commission and shall ensure that  all  information
      from  such  inventories  as amended, including the condition assessments
    
      and maintenance schedules, and the opinions and recommendations  related
      to  such  maintenance  schedules  are centrally stored and accessible to
      such officials, the agencies involved and other interested parties.
        f. Not later than the first day of October of each year, commencing in
      nineteen  hundred  ninety,  the  mayor  shall  transmit  to  the council
      estimates for the  ensuing  fiscal  year  and  for  each  of  the  three
      succeeding  fiscal years of the amounts, by agency and project type and,
      within  project  type,  by  personal  services  and  other-than-personal
      services, necessary to maintain all major portions of the capital plant,
      consistent  with  the  maintenance  schedules  on  file  with  the mayor
      pursuant to subdivision e of  this  section.  Such  estimates  shall  be
      prepared  or  reviewed  by  the professional engineers or architects who
      prepared or reviewed  such  maintenance  schedules  or  by  professional
      engineers or architects registered in the State of New York and employed
      by  the  office  of management and budget or the agencies involved. Such
      architects or engineers shall set forth in writing (1) their opinions as
      to the reasonableness of such estimates and whether such estimates  have
      been  logically  derived  from  such maintenance schedules and (2) their
      recommendations, if any, for changes in such  estimates.  Such  opinions
      and  recommendations  shall  be  centrally  stored and accessible to any
      interested party.
