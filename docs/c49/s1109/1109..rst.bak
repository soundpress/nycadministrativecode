        §  1109. Summary inquiry. A summary inquiry into any alleged violation
      or neglect of duty in relation to the property, government or affairs of
      the city may be conducted under an order to be made by  any  justice  of
      the  supreme court in the first, second or eleventh judicial district on
      application of the mayor, the comptroller, the public advocate, any five
      council members, the commissioner of investigation or any five  citizens
      who are taxpayers, supported by affidavit to the effect that one or more
      officers,  employees  or  other  persons therein named have knowledge or
      information concerning such alleged violation or neglect of  duty.  Such
      inquiry shall be conducted before and shall be controlled by the justice
      making  the  order or any other justice of the supreme court in the same
      district. Such justice may require any officer or employee or any  other
      person  to  attend  and  be  examined  in relation to the subject of the
      inquiry. Any answers given by a witness in such  inquiry  shall  not  be
      used  against  such  witness in any criminal proceeding, except that for
      all false answers on material points such witness shall  be  subject  to
      prosecution for perjury. The examination shall be reduced to writing and
      shall  be  filed  in  the  office of the clerk of such county within the
      first, second or eleventh judicial district as the justice  may  direct,
      and shall be a public record.
