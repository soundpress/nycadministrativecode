Section 1121. ::    
        
     
        §  1121.  Agreements  concerning  performance of agency administrative
      functions. Notwithstanding any other  provision  of  local  law  to  the
      contrary,  two  or  more  agencies of the city may, by mutual agreement,
      share in  the  performance  of  specified  administrative  functions  or
      designate one or more of such agencies to perform such functions for one
      or  more  other  such  agencies if, in the judgment of the heads of such
      agencies, such sharing or designation will result in more  effective  or
      efficient  performance  of such functions for the agencies entering into
      such agreement. An agreement pursuant to this section  may  include  but
      shall  not  be  limited to the sharing of, or designation of one or more
      agencies to perform, one or more of the following  functions:  personnel
      services,   labor  relations,  facilities  maintenance  and  management,
      purchasing,  information  technology  and   telecommunications,   budget
      administration,  and  internal  auditing.  For purposes of this section,
      "agencies of the city" shall include but not be limited to  mayoral  and
      non-mayoral  agencies,  city  boards and commissions, and the offices of
      elected city officers.
