Section 1113. ::    
        
     
        §   1113.   Report   and   Advisory   Board   Review   Commission.  a.
      Notwithstanding  any  inconsistent  provision  of  this   charter,   the
      administrative  code  or  any  local  law and except as provided in this
      section, any requirement in this charter,  the  administrative  code  or
      otherwise  in  any  local  law that mandates the issuance of periodic or
      multiple reports by public agencies,  officers  or  employees  where  at
      least  one  such  report  is  due on or after the effective date of this
      section, and any  requirement  that  mandates  the  establishment  of  a
      commission,  committee,  board, task force or other similar body that is
      solely advisory in nature, shall be subject to waiver in accordance with
      the provisions of this section.
        b. There shall be a report and advisory board review commission, which
      shall consist of the speaker of the city council,  two  members  of  the
      council  to  be  chosen  by  the  speaker,  the corporation counsel, the
      director of the mayor's office of operations, the director of management
      and  budget,  and  the  commissioner  of  information   technology   and
      telecommunications  or  designated officers or employees of the agencies
      headed by such members or in the case of the council members, designated
      employees of  the  council.  The  director  of  the  mayor's  office  of
      operations shall be the chair of the commission.
        c.  The  commission  shall  meet  on  a  regular  basis,  at intervals
      determined by the  chair,  to  perform  the  reviews  required  by  this
      section. The commission shall hold at least one public hearing each year
      to  solicit comment from members of the public on matters required to be
      reviewed by the commission pursuant to this  section.  The  chair  shall
      have  charge  of  the  organization  of  the  commission  and shall have
      authority to employ, assign and superintend the duties of such  officers
      and  employees  as  may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this
      section. In addition, the speaker of the city council, the  commissioner
      or  head  of  any  agency or office represented on the commission or the
      commissioner or head of any other appropriate city agency or office may,
      if requested by the chair or the commission,  provide  staff  and  other
      assistance  with  respect  to  any matter within the jurisdiction of the
      commission.
        d. (1) Except as provided in paragraph six of  this  subdivision,  the
      commission  shall  have  the  power  and  responsibility  to  review all
      requirements in this charter or the administrative code or elsewhere  in
      the local laws of New York city that mandate the issuance of periodic or
      multiple  reports by city agencies, officers or employees where at least
      one such report is due on or after the effective date of  this  section,
      and  all  requirements  that  mandate  the establishment of commissions,
      committees, boards, task forces or other similar bodies that are  solely
      advisory  in  nature. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this
      charter, the administrative code or any local law, the commission  shall
      further  have  the  power  and  responsibility, subject to review by the
      council and the mayor as provided in paragraphs four and  five  of  this
      subdivision,   and   except   as  provided  in  paragraph  six  of  this
      subdivision, to waive any such  requirement.  The  commission  shall  be
      empowered  to  review  requirements in effect on and after the effective
      date of this section  regardless  of  the  date  of  enactment  of  such
      requirements;  provided,  however,  that  the  powers  and duties of the
      commission shall not extend to the mayor's  management  report  required
      pursuant to subdivision c of section twelve of this charter as in effect
      on  July  first,  two  thousand  ten,  or  to requirements mandating the
      issuance of reports, or  the  creation  of  bodies,  that  are  required
      pursuant  to  any  state  or federal law, rule or regulation or that are
      both (i) in effect on July first, two thousand ten and (ii) set forth in
    
      or required by sections ninety-three, ninety-five or ninety-six,  or  by
      chapters six, nine, ten or eleven of this charter.
        (2)  Prior to making any determination to waive a requirement pursuant
      to this section,  the  commission  shall,  to  the  extent  practicable,
      solicit the views of groups, organizations, or entities representing the
      interests  of  persons  and  entities  that  the chair or the commission
      reasonably determines are the subject of or are  otherwise  affected  or
      benefited  by  the requirement under review. Any such determination made
      by the commission shall include a  statement  that  the  commission  has
      solicited input in accordance with this paragraph.
        (3)   The   commission   shall  review  all  requirements  within  its
      jurisdiction. Except as provided in  this  subdivision,  the  chair  may
      establish  the  agenda  and priorities of the commission with respect to
      the order in which the commission reviews requirements and with  respect
      to similar matters. Upon completing its review of each such requirement,
      the  commission  shall  issue  a written determination whether or not to
      waive  such  requirement  and,  if  the   commission   determines   such
      requirement  shall  be  waived,  stating  the reasons therefor. A report
      waived by the commission, subject to the review  process  set  forth  in
      paragraphs  four  and  five  of  this  subdivision,  shall  cease  to be
      required. In the event that  the  commission  determines  to  waive  the
      requirement that mandates the establishment of an advisory body, if such
      waiver  is  approved  by  the  council  and  the  mayor  pursuant to the
      provisions of this section, such body shall  cease  to  exist  following
      such  approval. The commission may waive a reporting requirement in part
      rather than in whole by identifying particular required elements of such
      report that should be waived or retained.  The  commission  shall  issue
      determinations  with  respect  to requirements that are in effect on the
      date of adoption of this section  no  later  than  November  first,  two
      thousand  fifteen,  and  shall  issue  determinations  with  respect  to
      requirements enacted after such date of  adoption  no  later  than  five
      years  after  the date of enactment of such requirements. The commission
      may from time to time make further determinations with  respect  to  the
      waiver   of  any  such  requirement;  provided,  however,  that  when  a
      requirement has been retained by the commission or as a  result  of  the
      review   process   set  forth  in  paragraphs  four  and  five  of  this
      subdivision, the commission shall again review such  requirement  within
      five years of the date of the determination to retain the requirement.
        (4) The commission shall promptly file with the council and the mayor,
      publish   in  the  city  record  and  post  on  the  city  website  each
      determination to waive a requirement, whether in part or in whole,  that
      is  issued  pursuant  to  paragraph three of this subdivision, and shall
      promptly provide copies of such determination electronically or  by  any
      other  reasonable  means to groups, organizations or entities from which
      the commission has solicited input in accordance with paragraph  two  of
      this  subdivision.  Within  one  hundred  twenty days of the filing of a
      determination by the commission,  the  council  may  either  approve  or
      disapprove  such  determination by the affirmative vote of a majority of
      all the council members. If, at the end of such one hundred twenty days,
      the council has failed to act on a determination of the commission,  the
      council  shall  be  deemed to have approved such determination, and such
      determination shall take effect.
        (5) All actions of the council pursuant to this subdivision  shall  be
      filed  by the council with the mayor prior to the expiration of the time
      period for council action under paragraph four of this subdivision.  Any
      approval  by  the  council  pursuant  to  this subdivision, whether as a
      result of council  action  or  failure  to  act,  shall  be  final.  Any
      disapproval  by  the council pursuant to this subdivision shall be final
    
      unless the mayor within ten days of receiving a filing with  respect  to
      such  action files with the council a written disapproval of the action.
      A mayoral disapproval pursuant to this paragraph shall have  the  effect
      of vetoing any council disapproval and shall be subject to override by a
      two-thirds  vote  of all the council members within fifteen days of such
      filing by the mayor.
        (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in  no  event
      shall  the  commission  make  a  determination  to  waive  a requirement
      otherwise subject to its jurisdiction for three years following the date
      of enactment of the most recent local law imposing any such requirement.
        e. The commission shall base its reviews and  determinations  on  such
      criteria as it may deem appropriate. Such criteria shall include but not
      be limited to the following:
        (1)  With  regard  to  requirements mandating the issuance of reports:
      whether the  report  provides  useful  information  for  evaluating  the
      results of programs, activities and functions and their effectiveness in
      achieving their goals and objectives; whether the report provides useful
      information  for  assessing  the effectiveness of the management of city
      resources; whether the report is entirely or  partially  duplicative  of
      the  subject  matter  of  any  other mandated report; whether the report
      remains relevant in light of changing circumstances, current information
      needs  and  technological  advances;  and  whether  the   benefits   and
      usefulness of the report outweigh the expenditure of public resources to
      produce it.
        (2)  With  regard  to  requirements  mandating  the  establishment  of
      advisory commissions, committees, boards, task forces or  other  similar
      bodies:    whether  the  body substantially furthers the mission of city
      agencies with which it interacts or within which it is located;  whether
      the function or jurisdiction of a body is entirely or partly duplicative
      of  the function or jurisdiction of any other mandated body; whether the
      function or jurisdiction of a body  is  limited  to  the  production  of
      reports  that  have  been  waived  pursuant to this section; whether the
      function or jurisdiction of a body remains relevant in light of changing
      circumstances and needs; and whether the benefits and usefulness of  the
      body  outweigh  the  expenditure  of  public  resources  to  support and
      interact with it.
        f. In addition to the powers set forth in subdivisions a through e  of
      this  section, the commission may recommend to the mayor and the council
      the modification of existing requirements with respect to  the  issuance
      of  reports  and the establishment of solely advisory bodies in order to
      make the implementation of such requirements more effective in achieving
      their intended purposes; such recommendations may include,  but  not  be
      limited  to  recommendations designed to modify or consolidate reporting
      requirements in light of technological advances, and may also  evaluate,
      and  make  recommendations  to  the  mayor  and  the council concerning,
      additional data needs.
        g. Nothing in this section shall be  construed  to  prevent  the  city
      council  from  acting  by  local  law to limit or repeal any requirement
      otherwise subject to this section at any time, or to enhance  or  extend
      such  requirement. Any such enhancement or extension shall be subject to
      commission review pursuant to this section, provided, however, that such
      review is limited by the three-year period set forth in paragraph six of
      subdivision d.
