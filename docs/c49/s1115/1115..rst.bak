Section 1115. ::    
        
     
        § 1115. Officer not to hold any other civil office. Any person holding
      office,  whether  by  election  or  appointment,  who shall, during such
      person's term of office, accept, hold or retain any other  civil  office
      of  honor, trust or emolument under the government of the United States,
      except commissioners for the taking of bail, or of the state, except the
      office of notary public or commissioner  of  deeds  or  officer  of  the
      national  guard,  or who shall hold or accept any other office connected
      with the government of the city, or who  shall  accept  a  seat  in  the
      legislature,  shall be deemed thereby to have vacated any office held by
      such person under the city government; except that the mayor may accept,
      or may in writing authorize any other person holding office to accept, a
      specified  civil  office  in  respect  to  which  no  salary  or   other
      compensation  is  provided.  No  person  shall  hold  two city or county
      offices, except as expressly provided in this charter or by statute; nor
      shall any officer under the city government hold  or  retain  an  office
      under a county government, except when such officer holds such office ex
      officio  by  virtue of an act of the legislature, and in such case shall
      draw no salary for such ex officio; provided, however, that  any  member
      of the police force or any member of the fire department may hold office
      as  a  member of a board of education outside of the city of New York if
      otherwise qualified to serve thereon.
