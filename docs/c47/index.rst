        c.  Participating  agencies  shall  ensure  that the employees of such
      agency do not make any statement to an applicant for services or  client

      bearing on their eligibility to receive or the availability of  services
      or benefits provided by such agency.
        d. Each participating agency shall request that any contractor of such
      agency  operating  pursuant  to a contract which (i) is in excess of two

      the  commissioner  of  the  department of health and mental hygiene, may
      exclude a program in whole or in part  from  the  requirements  of  this
      section  upon determining that the inclusion of such a program would not
      substantially further the purpose of  the  local  law  that  added  this
      section.  The  commissioner  or  head  of each participating agency that
      administers programs receiving funds under the workforce investment  act
      of  1998,  as  codified  at  29  U.S.C.  § 2801 et seq., shall, with the

      workforce development services, including core and intensive services or
      substantive training funded in whole or in part by the city's  share  of
      funds provided under such workforce investment act, shall be required to
      fulfill  the  obligations  of participating agencies under this section;
      such determination shall be based upon whether  the  inclusion  of  such
      offices  would  substantially  further the purpose of the local law that
      added this section. A copy of each determination made pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall  be  forwarded  to  the  council and the mayor within
      thirty days of such determination.
