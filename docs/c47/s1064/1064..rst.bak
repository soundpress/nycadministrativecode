        b.  The  procurement policy board shall regularly review the scope and
      form of all information maintained pursuant to this  section  and  shall
      promulgate rules regarding its contents, organization and management.
        c. The mayor shall ensure adequate public access to the information on
      contracts  and  contractors,  which  shall  be maintained in a manner to
      facilitate public  review,  with  due  consideration  for  the  need  to
      protect, where appropriate, the confidentiality of any such information.
        d.  The information on contracts and contractors shall be computerized
      to the extent feasible. The computerized information shall be stored  in

      contract  number  included in prior notices published in the City Record
      pursuant to section three hundred twenty-five.  At  least  one  computer
      terminal  shall  be  available  for  such  access  in  the central place
      established by the mayor pursuant to subdivision a of this section.
