      recertification  of services or request for a change of address relating
      to the provision of services by such  agency;  provided,  however,  that
      this  section  shall  not  apply  to  services  that must be provided to
      prevent actual or potential danger to the life, health or safety of  any
      individual  or  to  the  public;  (ii) include a public health insurance
      program options pamphlet with any agency communication sent through  the
      United  States  mail  for  the purpose of supplying an individual with a
      written application for services, renewal or recertification of services
      or with a request for a change of address form relating to the provision
      of services by such agency; and (iii)  provide  an  opportunity  for  an
      individual  requesting  a  written  application for services, renewal or
      recertification for services or change of address form relating  to  the
      provision  of  services  by  such  agency  via the Internet to request a
      public health insurance  program  options  pamphlet,  and  provide  such
      pamphlet,  by  United  States  mail  or  an  Internet address where such
      pamphlet may be viewed or downloaded, to any person  who  indicates  via
      the Internet that they wish to be sent a public health insurance program
      options  pamphlet;  provided,  however,  that  the  taxi  and  limousine
      commission shall only  be  required  to  distribute  the  public  health
      insurance  program  options  pamphlet  to  those persons applying for or
      renewing a driver's license  or  vehicle  license  as  those  terms  are
      defined  in  section 19-502 of this code; and provided further, that the
      board of education shall be required only  to  ensure  that  the  public
      health  insurance  program  options  pamphlet  is  distributed  to those
      individuals who appear in person to  register  a  child  in  the  public
      school system.
        c.  Participating  agencies  shall  ensure  that the employees of such
      agency do not make any statement to an applicant for services or  client
      or  take  any  action  the  purpose  or  effect  of which is to lead the
      applicant or client to believe that a decision to request public  health
      insurance  or a public health insurance program options pamphlet has any
      bearing on their eligibility to receive or the availability of  services
      or benefits provided by such agency.
        d. Each participating agency shall request that any contractor of such
      agency  operating  pursuant  to a contract which (i) is in excess of two
      hundred and fifty thousand dollars and (ii) requires such contractor  to
    
      supply individuals with a written application for, or written renewal or
      recertification  of  services,  or request for change of address form in
      the  daily  administration  of  their  contractual  obligation  to  such
      participating  agency, fulfill the obligations of participating agencies
      under this section.
        e. Each participating agency may establish  procedures  as  they  deem
      necessary  to  implement  the  local  law  that  added this section. The
      commissioner or head of a participating agency, with the concurrence  of
      the  commissioner  of  the  department of health and mental hygiene, may
      exclude a program in whole or in part  from  the  requirements  of  this
      section  upon determining that the inclusion of such a program would not
      substantially further the purpose of  the  local  law  that  added  this
      section.  The  commissioner  or  head  of each participating agency that
      administers programs receiving funds under the workforce investment  act
      of  1998,  as  codified  at  29  U.S.C.  § 2801 et seq., shall, with the
      concurrence of the commissioner of the department of health  and  mental
      hygiene,  determine  which  workforce  investment  act offices providing
      workforce development services, including core and intensive services or
      substantive training funded in whole or in part by the city's  share  of
      funds provided under such workforce investment act, shall be required to
      fulfill  the  obligations  of participating agencies under this section;
      such determination shall be based upon whether  the  inclusion  of  such
      offices  would  substantially  further the purpose of the local law that
      added this section. A copy of each determination made pursuant  to  this
      subdivision  shall  be  forwarded  to  the  council and the mayor within
      thirty days of such determination.
