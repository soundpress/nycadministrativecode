      pierhead line or other similar line demarcating the extent of waterfront
      development  may  be  delineated,  established   or   changed   by   the
      commissioner except in accordance with sections one hundred ninety-eight
      and  one  hundred  ninety-nine  of this charter. Any existing waterfront
      plan containing  such  lines  shall  be  continued  in  effect  and  may
      similarly  be  changed  only  in  accordance  with  sections one hundred
      ninety-eight and one hundred ninety-nine.  The commissioner may apply to
      the city planning commission to incorporate such existing plans for  the
      water  front  or  any  portion thereof into the city map pursuant to the
      procedure for review and approval of a change to the city map. Any plans
      for the water front or portions thereof so incorporated shall thereafter
      be discontinued as separate plans.
        b. No wharf, pier, bulkhead, basin, dock,  slip,  marginal  street  or
      other  structure shall be laid out, built, or rebuilt in the port of New

      to  time  change  the width or location of any of the piers laid down on
      such plans and build or rebuild temporary wharf structures or license or
      permit the building or rebuilding thereof as may be provided by law.
        c. The commissioner may widen, open, construct, abandon or  close  any
      marginal  street or avenue included in such plans and shall maintain the
      widened portion of such street or avenue, or the new street or avenue as
      a marginal street, and such new street, or such a widened street to  the
      extent  of  the portion so widened, shall not be a public street. Before
      acting under this subdivision, the commissioner shall make a  report  to
      the city planning commission including a map showing any proposed change
      and  such other information as the chair of the city planning commission
      shall require. If the city planning commission makes a finding that  the
      proposed  change  is in accordance with the water front plan or approves
      the change, the commissioner may  proceed  with  it,  but  if  the  city
      planning  commission  makes  a finding that it is not in accordance with
      such plan and disapproves the change, then the  commissioner  shall  not
      proceed   unless  the  council  by  a  two-thirds  vote  authorizes  the
      commissioner to proceed. The city planning commission shall act on  such
      change  within six weeks from the time when it is filed in the office of
      the commission and if it does not act within such six weeks  period  the

Section 1304. ::    
        
     
        § 1304. Division of Economic and Financial Opportunity. There shall be
      a division of economic and financial opportunity within the department.
        a.  The  purpose  of  the  division shall be to enhance the ability of
      minority and women owned  business  enterprises  and  emerging  business
      enterprises  to  compete  for  city contracts, to enhance city agencies'
      awareness of such business enterprises, and to ensure  their  meaningful
      participation in city procurement.
        b.  The  commissioner  shall  administer,  coordinate,  and  enforce a
      citywide program  established  by  local  law  for  the  identification,
      recruitment,  certification  and  participation  in  city procurement of
      minority and women owned  business  enterprises  and  emerging  business
      enterprises.
        c.  The commissioner shall be authorized to promulgate rules necessary
      to implement the purposes of such  local  law.  The  commissioner  shall
      consult  with the procurement policy board in drafting and adopting such
      rules.  Such rules shall define sanctions, consistent  with  local  law,
      which  are  appropriate to remedy violations or penalize contractors for
      failure to comply with the provisions of local law or with  any  program
      or rule established pursuant to local law.
        d. The commissioner shall monitor the implementation of all financial,
      technical,  managerial, and bonding assistance programs operated by city
      agencies to enhance participation by minority and women  owned  business
      enterprises and emerging business enterprises in city procurement.
        e.  The  commissioner  shall  have  the following powers and duties to
      implement the purposes of this section:
        1. to  direct  and  assist  agencies  in  their  efforts  to  increase
      participation  by  minority  and  women  owned  business enterprises and
      emerging business enterprises as contractors and subcontractors in  city
      procurement;
        2. to develop standardized forms and reporting documents;
        3.  to  conduct,  coordinate  and  facilitate technical assistance and
      educational programs;
        4. to periodically review the compliance of  city  agencies  with  the
      provisions   of   local   law   for   the  identification,  recruitment,
      certification and participation in  city  procurement  of  minority  and
      women owned business enterprises and emerging business enterprises;
        5.  to  annually  report  to the mayor and the council, as required by
      such local law, on  the  activities  of  the  division  and  efforts  by
      agencies to comply with the provisions of such local law;
        6.  a.  to establish and operate, on behalf of the city, a centralized
      program for the certification of minority  owned  business  enterprises,
      women  owned  business enterprises and emerging business enterprises for
      the purposes of establishing the  eligibility  of  such  businesses  for
      participation  in  the  programs  and  processes established pursuant to
      local law to ensure their meaningful participation in city procurement.
        b. For the purposes of such certification,  "minority  owned  business
      enterprise"  and  "women  owned business enterprise" shall mean business
      enterprises authorized to do business  in  this  state,  including  sole
      proprietorships,  partnerships  and  corporations, in which (i) at least
      fifty-one percent of the ownership interest is  held  by  United  States
      citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  who are either minority group
      members or women, (ii) the ownership interest  of  such  individuals  is
      real,  substantial  and  continuing, and (iii) such individuals have and
      exercise the authority to control independently the day to day  business
      decisions of the enterprise;
        c.   For  the  purposes  of  such  certification,  "emerging  business
      enterprise" shall mean a business enterprise authorized to  do  business
      in   this   state,  including  sole  proprietorships,  partnerships  and
    
      corporations, in which (i) at least fifty-one percent of  the  ownership
      interest is held by United States citizens or permanent resident aliens;
      (ii) the ownership interest of such individuals is real, substantial and
      continuing,  (iii)  such  individuals have and exercise the authority to
      control  independently  the  day  to  day  business  decisions  of   the
      enterprise;  and  (iv) such individuals have demonstrated, in accordance
      with regulations promulgated by the commissioner, that they are socially
      and economically disadvantaged.  An  individual  who  is  "socially  and
      economically disadvantaged" shall mean an individual who has experienced
      social disadvantage in American society as a result of causes not common
      to  individuals who are not socially disadvantaged, and whose ability to
      compete  in  the  free  enterprise  system  has  been  impaired  due  to
      diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the
      same  business  area who are not socially disadvantaged. An individual's
      race, national origin, or  gender  by  itself,  shall  not  qualify  the
      individual  as  "socially  disadvantaged." In drafting such regulations,
      the commissioner shall consider criteria developed for federal  programs
      established to promote opportunities for businesses owned by individuals
      who  are socially and economically disadvantaged, including criteria for
      determining initial and continued eligibility in  relation  to  the  net
      worth of individuals claiming to be economically disadvantaged, provided
      that  the  net  worth of an individual claiming disadvantage pursuant to
      this section must be less than one million dollars. In determining  such
      net  worth,  the  department shall exclude the ownership interest in the
      business enterprise and the equity in the primary personal residence.
        d. To be eligible for certification, a business enterprise shall  have
      a  real  and substantial business presence in the market for the city of
      New York, as defined by the commissioner pursuant to local law.
        e. The commissioner of small business services  may  provide  by  rule
      criteria and procedures for firms certified as minority owned businesses
      and  women  owned  businesses  by  other  governmental  entities  to  be
      recognized as certified business enterprises by the city of New York.
        7.  to  conduct  site   visits   at   business   enterprises   seeking
      certification,  the basis for which shall be provided by rule, to verify
      that such business enterprises are eligible for certification;
        8. to audit  such  certified  business  enterprises  and  periodically
      review   and  in  appropriate  cases  recertify  their  eligibility  for
      participation in programs established pursuant to local law;
        9. to direct and assist city agencies in  their  efforts  to  increase
      participation  by  minority  owned  business  enterprises,  women  owned
      business  enterprises  and  emerging   business   enterprises   in   any
      city-operated financial, technical, and management assistance program;
        10.  to  assist  all  business  enterprises certified pursuant to this
      section in becoming prequalified for all categories of  procurement  for
      which  they  may  be eligible and for which contracting agencies utilize
      prequalification in the procurement process;
        11. to prepare, periodically update, and post on the  website  of  the
      division a directory of such city certified business enterprises for use
      by  city  agencies  and contractors, which shall include information for
      each such business enterprise, as applicable, including but not  limited
      to:  (i)  identification  of  the  market  sector  in which the business
      enterprise  operates;  (ii)  the  bonding  capacity  of   the   business
      enterprise; (iii) the contract price and specific tasks performed by the
      business  enterprise  for  its  last  three  contracts;  (iv)  the union
      affiliation, if any, of the certified business enterprise; and  (v)  the
      renewal date for certification;
        12. to develop a clearinghouse of information on programs and services
      available to such business enterprises; and
    
        13.  to  provide such assistance to business enterprises interested in
      being certified as is needed to ensure that such businesses benefit from
      city technical, managerial, and financial assistance, and other business
      development programs.
        f. Responsibilities of the city agencies. The head of each city agency
      shall:
        1.  establish  and  implement  reasonable  measures  and procedures to
      secure  the  meaningful  participation  of   city   certified   business
      enterprises  in  the  agency's  (1)  procurement  of goods, services and

      carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to local law;
        4.  cooperate  with  and  furnish to the division such information and

        1.  shall  not discriminate against any individual in violation of any
      federal, state or local law;
        2. shall inform any employee  representatives  authorized  to  bargain
      collectively  for its employees of the contractor's obligations pursuant
      to this section, and negotiate with such representatives to obtain their
      cooperation in the implementation of such obligations;
        3. shall require that any subcontractor it employs in the  performance
      of the contract comply with the requirements of this section.
        e.  1.  The  commissioner  shall  require  employment  reports  to  be
      submitted  in  such  form  and  containing  such  information   as   the
      commissioner  may  prescribe, by contractors to whom agencies propose to
      award city  contracts  and  their  proposed  subcontractors,  when  such
      contracts  or  subcontracts have a value above a monetary threshold that
    
      the commissioner shall by rule establish. The commissioner may  by  rule
      provide for appropriate exemptions from such requirements.
        2.  An  employment  report  shall  include,  but  not  be  limited to,
      employment practices, policies, procedures,  statistics  and  collective
      bargaining   agreements.  The  contracting  agency  shall  transmit  the
      employment report to the commissioner after the selection of a  proposed
      contractor   or   subcontractor.   The  commissioner  shall  review  all
      employment  reports  to   determine   whether   such   contractors   and
      subcontractors  are  in compliance with the equal employment opportunity
      requirement of local, state and federal law and executive orders.
        3. Except as provided in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this subdivision,  a
      contracting  agency  may  award  the contract or approve a subcontractor
      upon receiving the approval of the division, or after a number  of  days
      to  be  specified  by rule have passed since it submitted the employment
      report of the proposed contractor to the division, whichever is sooner.
        4. If the commissioner notifies the contracting agency that a proposed
      contractor or subcontractor has failed to submit a  complete  employment
      report,  the  commissioner  shall  require the contracting agency not to
      award the contract or approve the subcontractor until after  a  complete
      employment report has been submitted to the division for its review.
        5.  If  the  commissioner  notifies  the  contracting  agency that the
      division has reason to believe that the contractor or  subcontractor  is
      not in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section, the
      commissioner  may  require  the  contracting  agency  not  to  award the
      contract or approve the subcontractor until the contractor has agreed to
      take appropriate action to come into compliance with such requirements.
        6. The commissioner may by  rule  provide  for  circumstances  when  a
      contract or subcontract may be awarded without the prior approval of the
      division,  which  shall  include  but  not  be  limited  to requirements
      contracts which may be awarded prior to the approval  of  an  employment
      report, subject to the condition that a purchase shall not be made under
      the  contract  until  the  division  has approved the employment report,
      emergency contracts, and contracts with  contractors  or  subcontractors
      for which the division has previously approved an employment report.
        7.  The  time  schedules  for actions required to be taken pursuant to
      this section shall be defined by rule of the procurement policy board in
      accordance with the provisions of section three hundred eleven.
        f. Periodic  review.  The  commissioner  may  require  contractors  or
      subcontractors  to file periodic employment reports after the award of a
      contract in such form and with such frequency as  the  commissioner  may
      direct  by  rule to determine whether such contractors or subcontractors
      are in compliance with applicable legal requirements and the  provisions
      of this section.
        g.  Responsibilities  of city agencies. The head of each city, county,
      borough or other office, position,  administration,  board,  department,
      division, commission, bureau, corporation, authority, or other agency of
      government,  where  the majority of board members are appointed directly
      or indirectly by the mayor or serve by virtue of being city officers, or
      the expenses of which are paid  in  whole  or  in  part  from  the  city
      treasury, including the board of education, city and community colleges,
      the   financial   services   corporation,   the   health  and  hospitals
      corporation, the public development corporation, school boards, and  the
      city housing authority, shall:
        1.  assist  the  division  in  monitoring  compliance  with  the equal
      employment opportunity requirements of contracts under its  jurisdiction
      and  refer  and  recommend  matters  to  the  division  with  respect to
      non-compliance with the provisions of this section;
    
        2. designate a deputy  commissioner  or  other  executive  officer  to
      advise  the  commissioner  concerning the activities and progress of the
      agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant  to  this  section;
      and
        3.  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  three  hundred
      thirty-five, impose remedies and sanctions for failure  to  comply  with
      the requirements included in city contracts pursuant to this section.
        h.  Enforcement, remedies and sanctions. Upon receiving a complaint or
      at its own instance, the commissioner may conduct such investigation  as
      may be necessary to determine whether contractors and subcontractors are
      in  compliance  with  the  equal  employment opportunity requirements of
      federal, state and local laws and executive orders. If the  commissioner
      has  reason  to  believe  that  a  contractor or subcontractor is not in
      compliance with the provisions of this section, the  commissioner  shall
      seek  the  contractor's or subcontractor's agreement to adopt and adhere
      to  an  employment  program  designed   to   ensure   equal   employment
      opportunity,  including  but  not limited to measures designed to remedy
      underutilization  of  minorities  and  women  in  the  contractor's   or
      subcontractor's  workforce,  and  may,  in  addition,  recommend  to the
      contracting agency that payments to the contractor be suspended  pending
      a  determination  of the contractor's or subcontractor's compliance with
      such requirements. If the contractor or subcontractor does not agree  to
      adopt  or does not adhere to such a program, the commissioner shall make
      a determination as to whether the  contractor  or  subcontractor  is  in
      compliance  with  the  provisions  of this section, and shall notify the
      head of the contracting agency of such determination and any  sanctions,
      including  withholding  of payment, imposition of an employment program,
      or other sanction or remedy provided by law or by  contract,  which  the
      executive   director  believes  should  be  imposed.  The  head  of  the
      contracting agency shall impose such sanction unless he or she  notifies
      the commissioner in writing that the agency head does not agree with the
      recommendation,  in  which  case  the  commissioner  and the head of the
      contracting agency shall jointly determine any sanction to  be  imposed.
      If  the agency head and the commissioner do not agree on the sanction to
      be imposed, the matter  shall  be  referred  to  the  mayor,  who  shall
      determine any sanction to be imposed.
        i. Confidentiality. To the extent permitted by law and consistent with
      the  proper  discharge  of  the  division's  responsibilities under this
      section all information provided by a contractor to the  division  shall
      be confidential.
        j. This section shall not apply:
        1. to contracts for financial or other assistance between the city and
      a government or governmental agency;
        2.  to  contracts,  resolutions, indentures, declarations of trust, or
      other  instruments  authorizing  or  relating  to   the   authorization,
      issuance,  award, and sale of bonds, certificates of indebtedness, notes
      or other fiscal obligations of the city, or consisting  thereof,  except
      as otherwise provided by law or executive order; or
        3.  to  employment  by the city of its officers and employees which is
      subject to equal employment opportunity requirements of applicable law.
