      in  city  contracts  regarding  the subject matter of this section. Such
      contract language shall be reviewed by  the  corporation  counsel.  Such

      federal, state or local law;
        2. shall inform any employee  representatives  authorized  to  bargain

        3. shall require that any subcontractor it employs in the  performance
      of the contract comply with the requirements of this section.
        e.  1.  The  commissioner  shall  require  employment  reports  to  be
      submitted  in  such  form  and  containing  such  information   as   the
      commissioner  may  prescribe, by contractors to whom agencies propose to
      award city  contracts  and  their  proposed  subcontractors,  when  such
      contracts  or  subcontracts have a value above a monetary threshold that

      provide for appropriate exemptions from such requirements.

      employment practices, policies, procedures,  statistics  and  collective

      employment report to the commissioner after the selection of a  proposed
      contractor   or   subcontractor.   The  commissioner  shall  review  all

      subcontractors  are  in compliance with the equal employment opportunity
      requirement of local, state and federal law and executive orders.
        3. Except as provided in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this subdivision,  a

      award the contract or approve the subcontractor until after  a  complete
      employment report has been submitted to the division for its review.
        5.  If  the  commissioner  notifies  the  contracting  agency that the
      division has reason to believe that the contractor or  subcontractor  is
      not in substantial compliance with the requirements of this section, the
      commissioner  may  require  the  contracting  agency  not  to  award the
      contract or approve the subcontractor until the contractor has agreed to
      take appropriate action to come into compliance with such requirements.
        6. The commissioner may by  rule  provide  for  circumstances  when  a
      contract or subcontract may be awarded without the prior approval of the
      division,  which  shall  include  but  not  be  limited  to requirements
      contracts which may be awarded prior to the approval  of  an  employment
      report, subject to the condition that a purchase shall not be made under
      the  contract  until  the  division  has approved the employment report,
      emergency contracts, and contracts with  contractors  or  subcontractors

      subcontractors  to file periodic employment reports after the award of a

      of this section.

      or indirectly by the mayor or serve by virtue of being city officers, or
      the expenses of which are paid  in  whole  or  in  part  from  the  city
      treasury, including the board of education, city and community colleges,
      the   financial   services   corporation,   the   health  and  hospitals
      corporation, the public development corporation, school boards, and  the
      city housing authority, shall:
        1.  assist  the  division  in  monitoring  compliance  with  the equal
      employment opportunity requirements of contracts under its  jurisdiction
      and  refer  and  recommend  matters  to  the  division  with  respect to
      non-compliance with the provisions of this section;
    
        2. designate a deputy  commissioner  or  other  executive  officer  to
      advise  the  commissioner  concerning the activities and progress of the
      agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant  to  this  section;
      and
        3.  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  three  hundred
      thirty-five, impose remedies and sanctions for failure  to  comply  with
      the requirements included in city contracts pursuant to this section.
        h.  Enforcement, remedies and sanctions. Upon receiving a complaint or
      at its own instance, the commissioner may conduct such investigation  as
      may be necessary to determine whether contractors and subcontractors are
      in  compliance  with  the  equal  employment opportunity requirements of
      federal, state and local laws and executive orders. If the  commissioner
      has  reason  to  believe  that  a  contractor or subcontractor is not in
      compliance with the provisions of this section, the  commissioner  shall
      seek  the  contractor's or subcontractor's agreement to adopt and adhere
      to  an  employment  program  designed   to   ensure   equal   employment
      opportunity,  including  but  not limited to measures designed to remedy
      underutilization  of  minorities  and  women  in  the  contractor's   or
      subcontractor's  workforce,  and  may,  in  addition,  recommend  to the
      contracting agency that payments to the contractor be suspended  pending
      a  determination  of the contractor's or subcontractor's compliance with
      such requirements. If the contractor or subcontractor does not agree  to
      adopt  or does not adhere to such a program, the commissioner shall make
      a determination as to whether the  contractor  or  subcontractor  is  in
      compliance  with  the  provisions  of this section, and shall notify the
      head of the contracting agency of such determination and any  sanctions,
      including  withholding  of payment, imposition of an employment program,
      or other sanction or remedy provided by law or by  contract,  which  the
      executive   director  believes  should  be  imposed.  The  head  of  the
      contracting agency shall impose such sanction unless he or she  notifies
      the commissioner in writing that the agency head does not agree with the
      recommendation,  in  which  case  the  commissioner  and the head of the
      contracting agency shall jointly determine any sanction to  be  imposed.
      If  the agency head and the commissioner do not agree on the sanction to
      be imposed, the matter  shall  be  referred  to  the  mayor,  who  shall
      determine any sanction to be imposed.
        i. Confidentiality. To the extent permitted by law and consistent with
      the  proper  discharge  of  the  division's  responsibilities under this
      section all information provided by a contractor to the  division  shall
      be confidential.
        j. This section shall not apply:
        1. to contracts for financial or other assistance between the city and
      a government or governmental agency;
        2.  to  contracts,  resolutions, indentures, declarations of trust, or
      other  instruments  authorizing  or  relating  to   the   authorization,

      or other fiscal obligations of the city, or consisting  thereof,  except
      as otherwise provided by law or executive order; or
