        § 1304. Division of Economic and Financial Opportunity. There shall be
      a division of economic and financial opportunity within the department.
        a.  The  purpose  of  the  division shall be to enhance the ability of
      minority and women owned  business  enterprises  and  emerging  business
      enterprises  to  compete  for  city contracts, to enhance city agencies'
      awareness of such business enterprises, and to ensure  their  meaningful
      participation in city procurement.
        b.  The  commissioner  shall  administer,  coordinate,  and  enforce a
      citywide program  established  by  local  law  for  the  identification,
      recruitment,  certification  and  participation  in  city procurement of
      minority and women owned  business  enterprises  and  emerging  business
      enterprises.
        c.  The commissioner shall be authorized to promulgate rules necessary
      to implement the purposes of such  local  law.  The  commissioner  shall
      consult  with the procurement policy board in drafting and adopting such
      rules.  Such rules shall define sanctions, consistent  with  local  law,
      which  are  appropriate to remedy violations or penalize contractors for
      failure to comply with the provisions of local law or with  any  program
      or rule established pursuant to local law.
        d. The commissioner shall monitor the implementation of all financial,
      technical,  managerial, and bonding assistance programs operated by city
      agencies to enhance participation by minority and women  owned  business
      enterprises and emerging business enterprises in city procurement.
        e.  The  commissioner  shall  have  the following powers and duties to
      implement the purposes of this section:
        1. to  direct  and  assist  agencies  in  their  efforts  to  increase
      participation  by  minority  and  women  owned  business enterprises and
      emerging business enterprises as contractors and subcontractors in  city
      procurement;
        2. to develop standardized forms and reporting documents;
        3.  to  conduct,  coordinate  and  facilitate technical assistance and
      educational programs;
        4. to periodically review the compliance of  city  agencies  with  the
      provisions   of   local   law   for   the  identification,  recruitment,
      certification and participation in  city  procurement  of  minority  and
      women owned business enterprises and emerging business enterprises;
        5.  to  annually  report  to the mayor and the council, as required by
      such local law, on  the  activities  of  the  division  and  efforts  by
      agencies to comply with the provisions of such local law;
        6.  a.  to establish and operate, on behalf of the city, a centralized
      program for the certification of minority  owned  business  enterprises,
      women  owned  business enterprises and emerging business enterprises for
      the purposes of establishing the  eligibility  of  such  businesses  for
      participation  in  the  programs  and  processes established pursuant to
      local law to ensure their meaningful participation in city procurement.
        b. For the purposes of such certification,  "minority  owned  business
      enterprise"  and  "women  owned business enterprise" shall mean business
      enterprises authorized to do business  in  this  state,  including  sole
      proprietorships,  partnerships  and  corporations, in which (i) at least
      fifty-one percent of the ownership interest is  held  by  United  States
      citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  who are either minority group
      members or women, (ii) the ownership interest  of  such  individuals  is
      real,  substantial  and  continuing, and (iii) such individuals have and
      exercise the authority to control independently the day to day  business
      decisions of the enterprise;
        c.   For  the  purposes  of  such  certification,  "emerging  business
      enterprise" shall mean a business enterprise authorized to  do  business
      in   this   state,  including  sole  proprietorships,  partnerships  and
    
      corporations, in which (i) at least fifty-one percent of  the  ownership
      interest is held by United States citizens or permanent resident aliens;
      (ii) the ownership interest of such individuals is real, substantial and
      continuing,  (iii)  such  individuals have and exercise the authority to
      control  independently  the  day  to  day  business  decisions  of   the
      enterprise;  and  (iv) such individuals have demonstrated, in accordance
      with regulations promulgated by the commissioner, that they are socially
      and economically disadvantaged.  An  individual  who  is  "socially  and
      economically disadvantaged" shall mean an individual who has experienced
      social disadvantage in American society as a result of causes not common
      to  individuals who are not socially disadvantaged, and whose ability to
      compete  in  the  free  enterprise  system  has  been  impaired  due  to
      diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the
      same  business  area who are not socially disadvantaged. An individual's
      race, national origin, or  gender  by  itself,  shall  not  qualify  the
      individual  as  "socially  disadvantaged." In drafting such regulations,
      the commissioner shall consider criteria developed for federal  programs
      established to promote opportunities for businesses owned by individuals
      who  are socially and economically disadvantaged, including criteria for
      determining initial and continued eligibility in  relation  to  the  net
      worth of individuals claiming to be economically disadvantaged, provided
      that  the  net  worth of an individual claiming disadvantage pursuant to
      this section must be less than one million dollars. In determining  such
      net  worth,  the  department shall exclude the ownership interest in the
      business enterprise and the equity in the primary personal residence.
        d. To be eligible for certification, a business enterprise shall  have
      a  real  and substantial business presence in the market for the city of
      New York, as defined by the commissioner pursuant to local law.
        e. The commissioner of small business services  may  provide  by  rule
      criteria and procedures for firms certified as minority owned businesses
      and  women  owned  businesses  by  other  governmental  entities  to  be
      recognized as certified business enterprises by the city of New York.
        7.  to  conduct  site   visits   at   business   enterprises   seeking
      certification,  the basis for which shall be provided by rule, to verify
      that such business enterprises are eligible for certification;
        8. to audit  such  certified  business  enterprises  and  periodically
      review   and  in  appropriate  cases  recertify  their  eligibility  for
      participation in programs established pursuant to local law;
        9. to direct and assist city agencies in  their  efforts  to  increase
      participation  by  minority  owned  business  enterprises,  women  owned
      business  enterprises  and  emerging   business   enterprises   in   any
      city-operated financial, technical, and management assistance program;
        10.  to  assist  all  business  enterprises certified pursuant to this
      section in becoming prequalified for all categories of  procurement  for
      which  they  may  be eligible and for which contracting agencies utilize
      prequalification in the procurement process;
        11. to prepare, periodically update, and post on the  website  of  the
      division a directory of such city certified business enterprises for use
      by  city  agencies  and contractors, which shall include information for
      each such business enterprise, as applicable, including but not  limited
      to:  (i)  identification  of  the  market  sector  in which the business
      enterprise  operates;  (ii)  the  bonding  capacity  of   the   business
      enterprise; (iii) the contract price and specific tasks performed by the
      business  enterprise  for  its  last  three  contracts;  (iv)  the union
      affiliation, if any, of the certified business enterprise; and  (v)  the
      renewal date for certification;
        12. to develop a clearinghouse of information on programs and services
      available to such business enterprises; and
    
        13.  to  provide such assistance to business enterprises interested in
      being certified as is needed to ensure that such businesses benefit from
      city technical, managerial, and financial assistance, and other business
      development programs.
        f. Responsibilities of the city agencies. The head of each city agency
      shall:
        1.  establish  and  implement  reasonable  measures  and procedures to
      secure  the  meaningful  participation  of   city   certified   business
      enterprises  in  the  agency's  (1)  procurement  of goods, services and
      construction and (2)  financial,  technical  and  managerial  assistance
      programs for such business enterprises;
        2.  monitor  all  city  contracts  under the agency's jurisdiction for
      compliance with programs and policies established pursuant to local law,

      and financial opportunity and the law department;
        3.  designate  a  deputy  commissioner  or  other executive officer to
      advise the commissioner concerning  the  activities  of  the  agency  in
      carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to local law;
        4.  cooperate  with  and  furnish to the division such information and
      assistance as may be required  in  the  performance  of  the  division's
      functions  under  this  section  and local law and the rules promulgated
      thereunder;
        5. make available  to  prospective  bidders  a  current  copy  of  the
      directory of city certified businesses; and
        6.  periodically  report  to  the division on activities undertaken to
      promote and increase participation by city-certified businesses  in  its
      procurement  and  any  financial,  technical,  or  management assistance
      program which it administers.
        g. Small and locally-based business enterprises. In  addition  to  the
      purposes  provided  in  this  section,  the  division  of  economic  and
      financial  opportunity,  or  such  other  bureau  or  division  of   the
      department  as  the  commissioner  may  designate,  shall administer any
      programs for small or locally-based business enterprise programs as  may
      be   established   by  law.  The  division  of  economic  and  financial
      opportunity  or  such  other  bureau  or  division  shall,  pursuant  to
      applicable  local  laws,  certify  such  enterprises  as are eligible to
