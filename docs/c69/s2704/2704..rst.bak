Section 2704. ::    
        
     
        §  2704.  Coterminality of local services. a.  The head of each agency
      responsible for one or more of the services listed below shall  organize
      the local service delivery districts of such agency as follows.
        (1)  To  be  coterminous  with each of the community districts:  local
      parks services; local recreation services; street  cleaning  and  refuse
      collection  services;  the patrol services of the police department; and
      social services, including community  services,  community  development,
      youth  services,  child  development, and special services for children;
      and
        (2) To  be  coterminous  with  one  or  more  community  districts  or
      aggregates  of  them:  housing  code  enforcement,  highway  and  street
      maintenance  and  repair,  sewer  maintenance  and  repair,  and  health
      services, other than municipal hospitals.
        b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, the requirement
      that patrol services of the police department be coterminous  with  each
      of  the  community  districts  in  any  borough  shall  not apply to any
      community district where the mayor, after consultation with  the  police
      commissioner,  shall  determine that establishment of such coterminality
      would be inconsistent with the most effective delivery of such services.
      The mayor shall promptly notify the council of any  such  determination,
      and  the  council  may,  by majority vote, disapprove such determination
      with respect to any community district within sixty days after the first
      stated meeting of the council following the receipt of such  notice.  If
      the  council  shall  disapprove  such  determination with respect to any
      community  district,  the  police  commissioner  shall  organize  patrol
      services to be coterminous with such district within ninety days of such
      disapproval.
        c. The council, by resolution subject to the approval of the mayor, or
      the  mayor by executive order, may direct that city services in addition
      to those specified in subdivision a of this section be made  coterminous
      with one or more community districts or aggregates of them.
        d.  The head of each agency whose local service delivery districts are
      not required to be coterminous  with  community  districts  pursuant  to
      subdivision  a  or  c  of  this section shall organize the local service
      delivery districts of the agency to coincide as closely as  possible  to
      the boundaries of the community districts.
        e.  For purposes of this section, coterminality of services shall mean
      that the boundaries of  the  local  service  districts  of  each  agency
      service  listed  in  subdivision  a  or  required to be made coterminous
      pursuant  to  subdivision  c  shall  coincide  with  the  boundaries  of
      community districts.
        f.    The  head  of  each  agency  responsible  for one or more of the
      services listed in subdivision a or  required  to  be  made  coterminous
      pursuant  to subdivision c shall:  (1) assign to each such local service
      district  at  least  one  official  with   managerial   responsibilities
      involving  the  exercise  of  independent  judgment  in  the scheduling,
      allocation and assignment of personnel and equipment and the  evaluation
      of  performance  or  the  management and planning of programs; each such
      official shall have operating or line authority  over  agency  programs,
      personnel  and  facilities within the local service district; (2) assign
      to each borough at least one borough commissioner, or official  with  an
      equivalent  title,  who  shall have line authority over agency programs,
      personnel and facilities within the borough related  to  such  services;
      such  official  shall  consult  regularly with the borough president and
      shall be a member of the borough service cabinet established pursuant to
      section twenty-seven  hundred  six  of  the  charter;  and  (3)  publish
      semi-annually  in  the  City  Record  and  make  available to interested
      parties a list, by community district and borough, of the  name,  title,
    
      office  mailing  address,  and  office telephone number of the officials
      appointed pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision and  to
      subdivision a of section twenty-seven hundred six.
        g.  The  head  of  any  agency  may  assign  or  reallocate personnel,
      equipment or other  resources  outside  a  community  district  to  meet
      emergency needs, special situations, or temporary conditions.
        h.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any agency from maintaining
      sub-districts within a community district for purposes of efficient  and
      effective  service  delivery so long as the combined sub-districts shall
      coincide  with  the  boundaries  of  the  community  district.   Nothing
      contained in this section shall prevent the establishment of any special
      district  authorized  pursuant  to  federal,  state  or  local  law, the
      boundaries of which do not coincide with the boundaries of  a  community
      district.
        i.  Each borough president may publish an annual report evaluating the
      delivery,  within  the  borough,  of  the  services  which are listed in
      subdivision a, or are  required  to  be  made  coterminous  pursuant  to
      subdivision c, of this section.
        j.  On  or  before the first day of December, nineteen hundred ninety,
      the mayor shall appoint a task force on service delivery, consisting  of
      no  more than ten members, to review the requirements of subdivisions a,
      c and f of this section. Such task force shall include members appointed
      upon the recommendation of the council,  comptroller,  public  advocate,
      and  borough presidents. The membership of the task force shall include,
      but not be limited to, community board members, district  managers,  and
      representatives  of  the  agencies  subject  to the requirements of this
      section. On or before  the  first  day  of  December,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-two,  the  task  force  shall  submit  a  report to the mayor and
      council summarizing its conclusions and presenting such  recommendations
      for  changes  in  the  list  of  services  made  coterminous pursuant to
      subdivisions a or c, and in the requirements for such services contained
      in subdivision f, as the task force deems appropriate.
        k.  The  mayor  shall  report  biennially  to  the  council   on   the
      implementation  of  the  requirements of this section. Such report shall
      include: (1) an evaluation of the quality of the services  delivered  to
      community  districts  pursuant  to  subdivisions a and c of this section
      during the preceding two fiscal years, (2) a  review  of  the  agencies'
      implementation  of  subdivisions  d  and  f  of  this  section,  and  of
      subdivision  a  of  section  twenty-seven  hundred  six,  and  (3)   any
      recommendations   for   changes   in  the  services  listed  or  in  the
      requirements for those services which the mayor deems appropriate.
