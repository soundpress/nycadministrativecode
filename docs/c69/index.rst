        §  2700.  Declaration  of  intent. It is the intent of this chapter to
      encourage and facilitate coterminous  community  districts  and  service
      districts to be used for the planning of community life within the city,
      the   participation   of   citizens  in  city  government  within  their
      communities, and the efficient and effective  organization  of  agencies
      that deliver municipal services in local communities and boroughs.

Section 2701. ::    
        
     
        § 2701. Community districts. a.  Each community district shall:
        (1)  Lie within the boundaries of a single borough, except as provided
      in subdivisions d and e of this section,  and  coincide  with  historic,
      geographic   and  identifiable  communities  from  which  the  city  has
      developed;
        (2) Be suitable for the efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  those
      services  of municipal agencies required to be made coterminous with the
      community districts, pursuant to  section  two  thousand  seven  hundred
      four, including particularly the service and districting requirements of
      the police and sanitation departments; and,
        (3)  Be  compact and contiguous and have a population of not more than
      two hundred fifty thousand persons.
        b.  Community districts shall be as nearly equal  in  population  with
      each  other as is possible under the criteria in paragraphs one, two and
      three of subdivision a of this section.
        c. With respect to the city's central business district in the borough
      of Manhattan from fifty-ninth street south, the  council  may  adopt  as
      part  of  the  community district map, districts which shall reflect its
      unique character as the city's  financial,  business  and  entertainment
      center.  In  so  doing,  the  council  shall take into consideration the
      residential, working and other daytime populations as well as the  hotel
      and  transient  or  other  nighttime populations and adhere as nearly as
      possible to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a  of  this
      section.
        d.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of Manhattan shall
      include Roosevelt Island, located in  the  east  river,  as  part  of  a
      community district in the borough of Manhattan, immediately opposite and
      to  the  west of Roosevelt Island.  However, for the purposes of meeting
      the requirements  of  section  twenty-seven  hundred  four  relating  to
      coterminality  of  local  services,  section  twenty-seven  hundred five
      relating to district service cabinets and section  twenty-seven  hundred
      seven relating to agency budget and service statements, Roosevelt Island
      shall  be  deemed included within a community district of the borough of
      Queens immediately opposite and to the east of Roosevelt  Island.    The
      chairperson  of  the community board of the Manhattan community district
      which includes Roosevelt Island, or his or  her  designee,  shall  be  a
      member  of  the  district  service  cabinet  of  each  of  the community
      districts in which  Roosevelt  Island  is  included  in  the  respective
      boroughs.
        e.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of the Bronx shall
      include that portion of the borough of Manhattan which lies north of the
      Harlem River.

Section 2702. ::    
        
     
        §  2702.  Preparation  and  adoption  of  map. a. The map of community
      districts in effect as of the seventh day of November, nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine  shall be continued until modified pursuant to this section.
      Not later than the first day of May  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four  and
      every tenth year thereafter, the mayor shall, and at such other times as
      the  mayor  deems appropriate, the mayor may, prepare and present to the
      council a report reviewing the community district map then in force  and
      presenting  such  recommendations  for  changes  in the map as the mayor
      deems appropriate. Such review shall consider shifts in population shown
      in the most recent decennial census that may require adjustments in  the
      community   district   map   to  conform  to  the  criteria  in  section
      twenty-seven hundred one.   Such  review  shall  also  consider  whether
      reducing the size of any community district would provide more efficient
      and   effective  service  delivery  within  the  district  or  districts
      involved. If the mayor's recommendations for changes in  the  map  would
      produce  a  community  district  with  a  population  below seventy-five
      thousand persons, the mayor may consider whether partial  suspension  of
      coterminality within the district is likely to provide more efficient or
      effective  service  delivery  of  one  or more of the services for which
      coterminality is required, and may recommend that coterminality for  one
      or  more  designated  services  within  the  community  district and any
      adjacent district be suspended. The mayor's recommendations for  changes
      shall  be  referred  to  as  the  preliminary  revision of the community
      district map.
        b. The borough presidents, city planning commission, community  boards
      and  other  civic,  community  and  neighborhood groups and associations
      shall  be  consulted  and  their  recommendations  considered   in   the
      preparation of the preliminary revision of the community district map.
        c.  The  mayor shall publish the preliminary revision of the community
      district map in the City Record and in each  borough  of  the  city  and
      shall,  jointly  with  the borough president, conduct one or more public
      hearings on it in each borough of the city. Within sixty days after  the
      last   such  hearing,  the  mayor  shall  submit  to  the  council  such
      preliminary revisions of the community district map as he or  she  deems
      appropriate.
        d.  The  council  shall  conduct  public  hearings  on the preliminary
      revision of the community district map submitted by  the  mayor  and  it
      shall, by resolution, within one hundred twenty days of such submission,
      adopt,  adopt with modifications, or disapprove the map as submitted. If
      the council adopts the proposed map without  modifications,  or  if  the
      mayor  concurs  in any modifications adopted by the council, the new map
      shall be effective as of the date specified in the mayor's  proposal  or
      in  the  modifications  adopted  by  the council and concurred in by the
      mayor. If the council disapproves the map as submitted by the mayor,  or
      if the council fails to act within the one hundred twenty day period, or
      if  the  mayor  does  not  concur  in  any  modifications adopted by the
      council, the community district  map  then  in  force  shall  remain  in
      effect.

Section 2704. ::    
        
     
        §  2704.  Coterminality of local services. a.  The head of each agency
      responsible for one or more of the services listed below shall  organize
      the local service delivery districts of such agency as follows.
        (1)  To  be  coterminous  with each of the community districts:  local
      parks services; local recreation services; street  cleaning  and  refuse
      collection  services;  the patrol services of the police department; and
      social services, including community  services,  community  development,
      youth  services,  child  development, and special services for children;
      and
        (2) To  be  coterminous  with  one  or  more  community  districts  or
      aggregates  of  them:  housing  code  enforcement,  highway  and  street
      maintenance  and  repair,  sewer  maintenance  and  repair,  and  health
      services, other than municipal hospitals.
        b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a, the requirement
      that patrol services of the police department be coterminous  with  each
      of  the  community  districts  in  any  borough  shall  not apply to any
      community district where the mayor, after consultation with  the  police
      commissioner,  shall  determine that establishment of such coterminality
      would be inconsistent with the most effective delivery of such services.
      The mayor shall promptly notify the council of any  such  determination,
      and  the  council  may,  by majority vote, disapprove such determination
      with respect to any community district within sixty days after the first
      stated meeting of the council following the receipt of such  notice.  If
      the  council  shall  disapprove  such  determination with respect to any
      community  district,  the  police  commissioner  shall  organize  patrol
      services to be coterminous with such district within ninety days of such
      disapproval.
        c. The council, by resolution subject to the approval of the mayor, or
      the  mayor by executive order, may direct that city services in addition
      to those specified in subdivision a of this section be made  coterminous
      with one or more community districts or aggregates of them.
        d.  The head of each agency whose local service delivery districts are
      not required to be coterminous  with  community  districts  pursuant  to
      subdivision  a  or  c  of  this section shall organize the local service
      delivery districts of the agency to coincide as closely as  possible  to
      the boundaries of the community districts.
        e.  For purposes of this section, coterminality of services shall mean
      that the boundaries of  the  local  service  districts  of  each  agency
      service  listed  in  subdivision  a  or  required to be made coterminous
      pursuant  to  subdivision  c  shall  coincide  with  the  boundaries  of
      community districts.
        f.    The  head  of  each  agency  responsible  for one or more of the
      services listed in subdivision a or  required  to  be  made  coterminous
      pursuant  to subdivision c shall:  (1) assign to each such local service
      district  at  least  one  official  with   managerial   responsibilities
      involving  the  exercise  of  independent  judgment  in  the scheduling,
      allocation and assignment of personnel and equipment and the  evaluation
      of  performance  or  the  management and planning of programs; each such
      official shall have operating or line authority  over  agency  programs,
      personnel  and  facilities within the local service district; (2) assign
      to each borough at least one borough commissioner, or official  with  an
      equivalent  title,  who  shall have line authority over agency programs,
      personnel and facilities within the borough related  to  such  services;
      such  official  shall  consult  regularly with the borough president and
      shall be a member of the borough service cabinet established pursuant to
      section twenty-seven  hundred  six  of  the  charter;  and  (3)  publish
      semi-annually  in  the  City  Record  and  make  available to interested
      parties a list, by community district and borough, of the  name,  title,
    
      office  mailing  address,  and  office telephone number of the officials
      appointed pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision and  to
      subdivision a of section twenty-seven hundred six.
        g.  The  head  of  any  agency  may  assign  or  reallocate personnel,
      equipment or other  resources  outside  a  community  district  to  meet
      emergency needs, special situations, or temporary conditions.
        h.  Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit any agency from maintaining
      sub-districts within a community district for purposes of efficient  and
      effective  service  delivery so long as the combined sub-districts shall
      coincide  with  the  boundaries  of  the  community  district.   Nothing
      contained in this section shall prevent the establishment of any special
      district  authorized  pursuant  to  federal,  state  or  local  law, the
      boundaries of which do not coincide with the boundaries of  a  community
      district.
        i.  Each borough president may publish an annual report evaluating the
      delivery,  within  the  borough,  of  the  services  which are listed in
      subdivision a, or are  required  to  be  made  coterminous  pursuant  to
      subdivision c, of this section.
        j.  On  or  before the first day of December, nineteen hundred ninety,
      the mayor shall appoint a task force on service delivery, consisting  of
      no  more than ten members, to review the requirements of subdivisions a,
      c and f of this section. Such task force shall include members appointed
      upon the recommendation of the council,  comptroller,  public  advocate,
      and  borough presidents. The membership of the task force shall include,
      but not be limited to, community board members, district  managers,  and
      representatives  of  the  agencies  subject  to the requirements of this
      section. On or before  the  first  day  of  December,  nineteen  hundred
      ninety-two,  the  task  force  shall  submit  a  report to the mayor and
      council summarizing its conclusions and presenting such  recommendations
      for  changes  in  the  list  of  services  made  coterminous pursuant to
      subdivisions a or c, and in the requirements for such services contained
      in subdivision f, as the task force deems appropriate.
        k.  The  mayor  shall  report  biennially  to  the  council   on   the
      implementation  of  the  requirements of this section. Such report shall
      include: (1) an evaluation of the quality of the services  delivered  to
      community  districts  pursuant  to  subdivisions a and c of this section
      during the preceding two fiscal years, (2) a  review  of  the  agencies'
      implementation  of  subdivisions  d  and  f  of  this  section,  and  of
      subdivision  a  of  section  twenty-seven  hundred  six,  and  (3)   any
      recommendations   for   changes   in  the  services  listed  or  in  the
