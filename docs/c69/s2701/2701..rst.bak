      geographic   and  identifiable  communities  from  which  the  city  has
      developed;
        (2) Be suitable for the efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  those
      services  of municipal agencies required to be made coterminous with the
      community districts, pursuant to  section  two  thousand  seven  hundred
      four, including particularly the service and districting requirements of
      the police and sanitation departments; and,
        (3)  Be  compact and contiguous and have a population of not more than
      two hundred fifty thousand persons.
        b.  Community districts shall be as nearly equal  in  population  with

        c. With respect to the city's central business district in the borough
      of Manhattan from fifty-ninth street south, the  council  may  adopt  as
      part  of  the  community district map, districts which shall reflect its
      unique character as the city's  financial,  business  and  entertainment
      center.  In  so  doing,  the  council  shall take into consideration the
      residential, working and other daytime populations as well as the  hotel
      and  transient  or  other  nighttime populations and adhere as nearly as
      possible to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a  of  this
      section.
        d.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of Manhattan shall
      include Roosevelt Island, located in  the  east  river,  as  part  of  a

      coterminality  of  local  services,  section  twenty-seven  hundred five
      relating to district service cabinets and section  twenty-seven  hundred
      seven relating to agency budget and service statements, Roosevelt Island
      shall  be  deemed included within a community district of the borough of
      Queens immediately opposite and to the east of Roosevelt  Island.    The
      chairperson  of  the community board of the Manhattan community district
      which includes Roosevelt Island, or his or  her  designee,  shall  be  a
      member  of  the  district  service  cabinet  of  each  of  the community
      districts in which  Roosevelt  Island  is  included  in  the  respective
      boroughs.
        e.  The  community  district  map  for  the borough of the Bronx shall
      include that portion of the borough of Manhattan which lies north of the
      Harlem River.
