Section 2702. ::    
        
     
        §  2702.  Preparation  and  adoption  of  map. a. The map of community
      districts in effect as of the seventh day of November, nineteen  hundred
      eighty-nine  shall be continued until modified pursuant to this section.
      Not later than the first day of May  nineteen  hundred  ninety-four  and
      every tenth year thereafter, the mayor shall, and at such other times as
      the  mayor  deems appropriate, the mayor may, prepare and present to the
      council a report reviewing the community district map then in force  and
      presenting  such  recommendations  for  changes  in the map as the mayor
      deems appropriate. Such review shall consider shifts in population shown
      in the most recent decennial census that may require adjustments in  the
      community   district   map   to  conform  to  the  criteria  in  section
      twenty-seven hundred one.   Such  review  shall  also  consider  whether
      reducing the size of any community district would provide more efficient
      and   effective  service  delivery  within  the  district  or  districts
      involved. If the mayor's recommendations for changes in  the  map  would
      produce  a  community  district  with  a  population  below seventy-five
      thousand persons, the mayor may consider whether partial  suspension  of
      coterminality within the district is likely to provide more efficient or
      effective  service  delivery  of  one  or more of the services for which
      coterminality is required, and may recommend that coterminality for  one
      or  more  designated  services  within  the  community  district and any
      adjacent district be suspended. The mayor's recommendations for  changes
      shall  be  referred  to  as  the  preliminary  revision of the community
      district map.
        b. The borough presidents, city planning commission, community  boards
      and  other  civic,  community  and  neighborhood groups and associations
      shall  be  consulted  and  their  recommendations  considered   in   the
      preparation of the preliminary revision of the community district map.
        c.  The  mayor shall publish the preliminary revision of the community
      district map in the City Record and in each  borough  of  the  city  and
      shall,  jointly  with  the borough president, conduct one or more public
      hearings on it in each borough of the city. Within sixty days after  the
      last   such  hearing,  the  mayor  shall  submit  to  the  council  such
      preliminary revisions of the community district map as he or  she  deems
      appropriate.
        d.  The  council  shall  conduct  public  hearings  on the preliminary
      revision of the community district map submitted by  the  mayor  and  it
      shall, by resolution, within one hundred twenty days of such submission,
      adopt,  adopt with modifications, or disapprove the map as submitted. If
      the council adopts the proposed map without  modifications,  or  if  the
      mayor  concurs  in any modifications adopted by the council, the new map
      shall be effective as of the date specified in the mayor's  proposal  or
      in  the  modifications  adopted  by  the council and concurred in by the
      mayor. If the council disapproves the map as submitted by the mayor,  or
      if the council fails to act within the one hundred twenty day period, or
      if  the  mayor  does  not  concur  in  any  modifications adopted by the
      council, the community district  map  then  in  force  shall  remain  in
      effect.
