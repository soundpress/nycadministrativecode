*§ 28-112.9.2 Lien.* ::

Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances except for the lien of taxes and assessments.

**Article 204: Environmental Control Board**

Any person who shall violate or fail to comply with any of the provisions of this code, the 1968 building code, the zoning resolution or other laws or rules enforced by the department or with any order issued pursuant thereto shall be liable for a civil penalty that may be recovered in a proceeding before the environmental control board. Such proceeding shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation returnable before the board. Such notice of violation may be issued by employees of the department or of other city agencies designated by the commissioner and may be served by such employees or by a licensed process server.






*§ 28-204.1.1 Violations of section 3321 of the New York city building code.* ::


In addition to any other penalties or remedies provided by law or rule, the following items shall apply to violations of section 3321 of the New York city building code:

1. Upon determining that a worker at a building site is not in compliance with section 3321.1 of the New York city building code:

   1.1. The commissioner shall issue a notice of violation to the owner of such site, each permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site and the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site if such person can reasonably be identified. Each such worker shall constitute a separate violation that shall be noticed and charged separately and shall be punishable by a separate civil penalty. It shall be an affirmative defense to such a violation that such worker provided such owner, permit holder or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site with an SST card, SST supervisor card, limited SST card, temporary SST card or documentation establishing training in compliance with such section, as appropriate, that reasonably appeared to be valid and applicable to such worker and such owner, permit holder or such person reasonably relied thereon.

   1.2. In addition to the requirements of any other law or rule, such violation shall not be deemed corrected until the commissioner determines that, for each such worker, the recipient of such violation shows, in a form and manner established by the commissioner, that such owner, a person acting on behalf of such owner, a permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site has entered into a binding agreement that satisfies each of the following conditions:

      1.2.1. Pursuant to such agreement, such owner, a person acting on behalf of such owner or a permit holder responsible for ensuring that such worker complies with such section at such site or the person who employed or otherwise engaged such worker at such site shall pay, either directly or indirectly, for the costs of such worker to obtain the training required to comply with such section or will otherwise arrange for such worker to receive such training at no cost to such worker.

      1.2.2. Pursuant to such agreement, and provided that such worker is diligently endeavoring to complete the training required by such section, such worker shall continue to be employed or otherwise engaged under the same terms and conditions that applied before such determination by the commissioner until (i) such worker successfully completes the training required to comply with such section, (ii) work for which such worker was employed or otherwise engaged at such site concludes or (iii) 60 days elapses after such determination, whichever occurs earlier, except that, during such period, such worker shall be paid as if such worker were working at such site 40 hours each week at the same hourly or effective hourly wage such worker was paid before such determination by the commissioner.

2. Upon determining that a permit holder at a building site has not maintained a daily log in compliance with section 3321.2 of the New York city building code, a notice of violation shall be issued to the owner of such site and such permit holder. Failure to maintain such a log establishes a rebuttable presumption that each worker for whom such permit holder is responsible for ensuring compliance with section 3321 of the New York city building code is not compliant with such section and shall result in the issuance of notices of violation under Item 1.

3. Upon a finding by the office of administrative trials and hearings, acting pursuant to section 1049-a of the New York city charter, or a court of competent jurisdiction that a second or subsequent violation of section 3321 of the New York city building code has occurred at a building site, the commissioner shall conduct at least one unannounced inspection of such site at least once every three months to determine compliance with such section. Such inspections shall continue until at least two consecutive inspections do not result in the issuance of a notice of violation of such section.

4. Upon a finding by the office of administrative trials and hearings, acting pursuant to section 1049-a of the New York city charter, or a court of competent jurisdiction that the owner of a building site, a permit holder at such site or a person employing or otherwise engaging workers at such site has violated section 3321 of the New York city building code and such violation is a second or subsequent violation of such section by such owner, permit holder or person, the commissioner shall conduct at least one unannounced inspection of (i) each building site owned by such owner, if such violation is a second or subsequent violation by such owner, (ii) each building site where such permit holder works, if such violation is a second or subsequent violation by such permit holder and (iii) each building site where such person works, if such violation is a second or subsequent violation by such person.








*§ 28-204.1.2 Notice of violating conditions outside of occupied dwelling units.* ::


An owner must post a copy of a notice of violation that relates to a violating condition outside of an occupied dwelling unit, including in a common area or affecting all residents, of such owner’s building in a conspicuous manner in the building’s lobby until such violation has been closed. In addition, such owner shall post a flyer or pamphlet, created by the department, with information about the adjudication process. Such notice of violation and flyer or pamphlet shall be posted as soon as practicable, but no later than five calendar days after it has been served.








*§ 28-204.1.3 Notice to occupants of violating conditions in occupied dwelling units.* ::


An owner must distribute a copy of a notice of violation to the resident of an occupied dwelling unit where such violation relates to a violating condition that is present within such dwelling unit, and to residents of occupied dwelling units adjacent to such dwelling unit. In addition, such owner shall provide such residents with a flyer or pamphlet, created by the department, with information about the adjudication process. Such notice of violation and flyer or pamphlet shall be distributed to such occupied dwelling units as soon as practicable, but no later than five calendar days after it has been served.








*§ 28-204.2 Order to certify correction.* ::


Each such notice of violation shall contain an order of the commissioner directing the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation and to file with the department electronically or in such other manner as the department may authorize by rule a certification that the condition has been corrected. Unless otherwise provided by rule, such order shall require that violations classified as major or lesser be corrected within 30 days from the date of the order, that violations classified as immediately hazardous be corrected forthwith. Such order shall also require that certification of the correction of the violation shall be filed with the department in a manner and form and within such period of time as shall be established by the department. In any proceeding before the environmental control board, no civil penalty shall be imposed for a lesser violation if the respondent complies with the commissioner's order to correct and to certify correction of the violation within the applicable time period. However, such violation may serve as a predicate for purposes of assessing aggravating factors attributable to multiple offenses.






*§ 28-204.3 Failure of proof.* ::


In any proceeding before the environmental control board, if the board finds that the commissioner has failed to prove the violation charged, the order requiring the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation and to file a certification of correction shall be deemed dismissed.






*§ 28-204.4 Failure to certify the correction of a violation.* ::


Failure to comply with an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to section 28-204.2 or pursuant to any provision of law or rule enforced by the department in effect at the time the order was issued to correct and to certify correction of a violation within the applicable time period shall be a violation of this code for which penalties may be imposed in addition to the penalties that may be or have been imposed for the violation referred to in such order. Upon application, for good cause, the commissioner may extend the time for filing the certification of correction of a violation, but not for more than 30 days for each extension.






*§ 28-204.5 False statements in certification of correction.* ::


For the purposes of this section 28-204.5, if the environmental control board finds that a certification of correction filed pursuant to section 28-204.2 contained material false statements relating to the correction of a violation, such certification of correction shall be null and void and the penalties set forth in this code for the violation may be imposed as if such false certification had not been filed with and accepted by the department. It shall be an affirmative defense that the respondent neither knew nor should have known that such statements were false.






*§ 28-204.6 Tax lien.* ::


Enforcement of environmental control board judgments against owners for certain building code violations. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an environmental control board judgment against an owner for a building code violation with respect to (i) a private dwelling, a wooden-framed single room occupancy multiple dwelling, or a dwelling with a legal occupancy of three or fewer dwelling units,(ii) a violation of section 28-210.1 involving the illegal conversion, maintenance or occupancy of three or more dwelling units than are legally authorized by the certificate of occupancy or if no certificate of occupancy is required as evidenced by official records, (iii) a building that contains twenty or more dwelling units, or that contains any space classified in an occupancy group other than occupancy group R, where the total value of all such judgments against such building is $60,000 or more, or (iv) a building that contains only space classified in occupancy group R and no fewer than six and no more than nineteen dwelling units, where the total value of all such judgments against such building is $30,000 or more, shall constitute a tax lien on the property named in the violation with respect to which such judgment was rendered, as hereinafter provided. Such liens shall be entered and enforced as provided in this section 28-204.6.

Exception: Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an environmental control board judgment shall not constitute a tax lien on the property named in the violation with respect to which such judgment was rendered where:

1. Such property was the subject of an in rem foreclosures judgment in favor of the city and was transferred by the city to a third party pursuant to section 11-412.1 of the administrative code within five years of such judgment.

2. Such property is the subject of a court order appointing an administrator pursuant to article 7-A of the real property actions and proceedings law in a case brought by the department of housing preservation and development.

3. Such property is the subject of a loan provided by or through the department of housing preservation and development or the New York city housing development corporation for the purpose of rehabilitation that had closed within five years before such judgment.








*§ 28-204.6.1 Record of unpaid judgments.** ::


There shall be filed in the office of the department a record of all such unpaid judgments. Such records shall be kept by tax lot and block number and shall be accessible to the public during business hours. An entry of a judgment on the records of the department shall constitute notice to all parties.






*§ 28-204.6.1 Tax lien reporting.** ::


On December 31, 2018, the department of finance shall submit a report to the mayor and the council on tax lien activities as a result of environmental control board judgment debt. Such report shall include: (i) the number of buildings subject to tax liens for environmental control board judgment debts, disaggregated by whether the tax lien was a result of an illegal conversion, more than $60,000 in debt, or more than $30,000 in debt; (ii) the location of such buildings disaggregated by council district; (iii) the number of dwelling units in each building which is subject to a tax lien; and (iv) recommendations for whether a 25 percent lien to value ratio is an appropriate threshold for a property to be considered distressed and if it is not, such report shall contain recommendations for what an appropriate threshold would be.








*§ 28-204.6.2 Lien.* ::


All such unpaid judgments shall constitute a lien upon the property named in the violation with respect to which such judgment was rendered when the amount shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department, and the department shall file such statement with the department of finance for entry against the property. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this section 28-204.6 shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless the requirements of section 28-204.6.1 are satisfied.






*§ 28-204.6.3 Notice.* ::


A notice, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the department of finance to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records of the department of finance as being the owner or agent of the property or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where no name appears, to the property, addressed to either the "owner" or the "agent."






*§ 28-204.6.4 Mailing.* ::


Such notice mailed by the department of finance pursuant to this section 28-204.6.4 shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to section 204.6.






*§ 28-204.6.5 Failure to pay charge.* ::


If such charge is not paid within 30 days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the department of finance to receive interest thereon at the same rate as unpaid real property taxes, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry.






*§ 28-204.6.6 Enforcement of lien.* ::


Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the property. Any remedy or procedure available for the enforcement of tax liens against such property, including, but not limited to, any sale of a tax lien or any foreclosure of a tax lien, shall be available with respect to such tax lien. In addition, such tax lien may be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of section 1354 of the real property actions and proceedings law.






*§ 28-204.6.7 Validity of lien.* ::


In any proceeding to enforce or discharge a lien created pursuant to this section 28-204.6, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on the lawfulness of the judgment, except as provided in this section 28-204.6.






*§ 28-204.6.8 Challenge.* ::


No such challenge may be made except by the owner of the property or a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but for the provisions of this section 28-204.6, have priority over the department's lien.






*§ 28-204.6.9 Notice to mortgagees and lienors.* ::


Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, no such judgment shall be entered and enforced as a tax lien against any property unless at the time of the issuance of the notice of violation a copy of such notice was also served on all mortgagees and lienors of record of such property by mail addressed to the recorded addresses of such mortgagees and lienors.






*§ 28-204.6.10 Non-exclusive remedy.* ::


The procedures provided in this section 28-204.6 for the enforcement of environmental control board judgments against owners shall be in addition to any other methods provided under any other provision of law for the enforcement of such judgments.

The owner, lessee, person in charge, or occupant of any building, structure, premises, equipment or part thereof, where a violation of this code, the 1968 building code, the zoning resolution or of other laws or rules enforced by the department or any order issued by the commissioner shall exist or the agent, architect, builder, contractor, engineer, or any other person who commits or assists in any such violation or who maintains any building, structure, premises, equipment or part thereof where any such violation shall exist shall be subject to an action or proceeding to restrain, correct or abate such violation, or to compel compliance with such order. Upon request of the commissioner, the corporation counsel may institute judicial actions or proceedings seeking such relief.
