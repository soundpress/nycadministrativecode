Section 1043. ::    
        
     
        §  1043.  Rulemaking.  a. Authority. Each agency is empowered to adopt
      rules necessary to carry out the powers and duties delegated to it by or
      pursuant to federal, state or local law. No agency shall  adopt  a  rule
      except pursuant to this section. Each such rule shall be simply written,
      using ordinary language where possible.
        b.  Notice. 1. Each agency shall publish the full text of the proposed
      rule in the City Record at least thirty days prior to the date set for a
      public hearing to be held pursuant to the requirements of subdivision  e
      of  this  section  or  the  final  date for receipt of written comments,
      whichever is earlier. A proposed rule amending an  existing  rule  shall
      contain  in brackets any part to be deleted and shall have underlined or
      italicized any new part to  be  added.  A  proposed  rule  repealing  an
      existing  rule  shall contain in brackets the rule to be repealed, or if
      the full text of the rule was published in the Compilation  required  to
      be published pursuant to section one thousand forty-five, shall give the
      citation  of the rule to be repealed and a summary of its contents. Such
      published notice shall include  a  draft  statement  of  the  basis  and
      purpose  of  the  proposed  rule, the statutory authority, including the
      particular sections and subdivisions upon which the action is based, the
      time and place of public hearing, if any, to be held or the reason  that
      a  public  hearing  will  not be held, and the final date for receipt of
      written  comments.  If  the  proposed  rule  was  not  included  in  the
      regulatory  agenda,  such  notice shall also include the reason the rule
      was not anticipated,  as  required  in  subdivision  c  of  section  one
      thousand forty-two of this chapter.
        2.   Copies   of   the  full  text  of  the  proposed  rule  shall  be
      electronically transmitted to the office of the speaker of the  council,
      the  council's office of legislative documents, the corporation counsel,
      each council member, the chairs of all community boards, the news  media
      and  civic  organizations  no  later  than the date the proposed rule is
      transmitted to the City Record for publication pursuant to paragraph one
      of subdivision b of this section; provided that an  inadvertent  failure
      to fully comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph shall not
      serve to invalidate any rule.
        3. (a) News media, for the purposes of this subdivision, shall include
      (i)  all  radio  and television stations broadcasting in the city of New
      York, all newspapers  published  in  the  city  of  New  York  having  a
      city-wide  or  borough-wide  circulation, and any newspaper of any labor
      union or trade association representing an  industry  affected  by  such
      rule,  and  (ii)  any  community newspaper or any other publication that
      requests such notification on an annual basis.
        (b) Civic organizations, for the purposes of this  subdivision,  shall
      include  any  city-wide or borough-wide organization or any labor union,
      trade association or other group that requests such notification  on  an
      annual basis.
        4.  In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph one of this
      subdivision, each agency shall provide information regarding the  public
      hearing  to  be  held  with  regard  to  a  proposed rule in a prominent
      location on such agency's website at least seven days prior to the  date
      set  for such hearing. Each agency shall further provide, in a prominent
      location on such agency's website, a link to the NYC Rules online portal
      or any successor city website or page that is substantially  similar  in
      form or function. Each agency shall, to the greatest extent practicable,
      and  in  addition  to the electronic transmissions required by paragraph
      two  of  this  subdivision,  publicize  upcoming  public  hearings   via
      electronic  means  that  are  likely  to reach interested members of the
      public. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private  right
    
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        c. Review of statutory authority. The corporation counsel shall review
      the  proposed  rule  to  determine  whether  it  is within the authority
      delegated by law to the agency proposing the rule.  If  the  corporation
      counsel  determines  that  the  proposed rule is not within the agency's
      delegated authority, the corporation counsel shall notify the agency  in
      writing prior to the publication of the final rule in the City Record.
        d.  1.  The  law department and the mayor's office of operations shall
      review each proposed rule prior to publication of such proposed rule  in
      the  City  Record.  At  the conclusion of its review, the law department
      shall state whether  each  proposed  rule:  (i)  is  drafted  so  as  to
      accomplish the purpose of the authorizing provisions of law; (ii) is not
      in conflict with other applicable rules; (iii) to the extent practicable
      and  appropriate,  is  narrowly drawn to achieve its stated purpose; and
      (iv) to the extent practicable and appropriate, contains a statement  of
      basis  and purpose that provides a clear explanation of the rule and the
      requirements imposed by the rule. As part of  its  review,  the  mayor's
      office  of  operations  shall  analyze each proposed rule and state: (a)
      whether such rule is understandable and written in plain  language;  (b)
      how  the  drafting  process  of  the rule, to the extent practicable and
      appropriate, included analysis sufficient  to  minimize  the  compliance
      costs for the discrete regulated community or communities, to the extent
      one  exists,  consistent  with achieving the stated purpose of the rule;
      and (c) why, in the event such rule  involves  the  establishment  of  a
      violation,  modification of a violation or modification of the penalties
      associated with a violation without also including  a  cure  period,  or
      other  opportunity  for  ameliorative  action  by  the  party or parties
      subject to enforcement,  such  cure  period  or  other  opportunity  for
      ameliorative  action  was  not  included. Provided, however, that if the
      proposed rule solely establishes or modifies the amount  of  a  monetary
      penalty  or penalties then the law department statement required by this
      paragraph shall not be required  and  the  analysis  of  the  office  of
      operations  may  be  limited  to  the reason or reasons a cure period or
      other opportunity for ameliorative action was not included.
        2. After completing the review as set forth in paragraph one  of  this
      subdivision,  the  law  department  and the mayor's office of operations
      shall certify that they have performed such review, and  shall  promptly
      transmit  a copy of such certification, including the analysis performed
      by the mayor's office of operations, to the relevant agency. Such agency
      shall annex such certification and analysis to  the  full  text  of  the
      proposed  rule  as  published in the City Record. Such certification and
      analysis shall also be made  available  to  the  public  on  the  city's
      website  and  transmitted to the speaker of the city council at the time
      of publication. In no event shall  a  proposed  rule  be  submitted  for
      initial publication in the City Record unless the law department and the
      mayor's   office  of  operations  have  issued  such  certification  and
      analysis.
        3. This subdivision shall not be construed to create a  private  right
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this subdivision shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        4. This subdivision shall not apply to rules that: (i) are promulgated
      pursuant to the emergency procedures set forth in subdivision i of  this
      section;   (ii)   are   solely   concerned  with  the  establishment  or
      modification of the amount of a monetary penalty or penalties,  and  the
      underlying  violation or a modification of the penalties associated with
      such violation has previously been analyzed in accordance with paragraph
      one  of  this  subdivision;  (iii)  are  solely   concerned   with   the
    
      establishment  or  modification  of  the amount of a fee or fees or (iv)
      implement particular mandates or standards set forth  in  newly  enacted
      federal,  state,  or  local laws, regulations or other requirements with
      only  minor,  if any, exercise of agency discretion in interpreting such
      mandates or standards.  If  an  analysis  of  a  proposed  rule  is  not
      performed  pursuant to the exceptions noted in this paragraph, such fact
      shall be noted and the note annexed to the full  text  of  the  proposed
      rule as published in the City Record.
        e. Opportunity for and consideration of agency and public comment. The
      agency  shall  provide  the  public  an  opportunity  to  comment on the
      proposed rule (i) through outreach to the discrete  regulated  community
      or  communities,  if  one exists, provided that this clause shall not be
      construed  to  create  a  private  right  of  action  to  enforce   this
      requirement;   (ii)  through  submission  of  written  data,  views,  or
      arguments, and (iii) at a public hearing unless it is determined by  the
      agency  in  writing,  which shall be published in the notice of proposed
      rulemaking in the City Record, that such a public hearing on a  proposed
      rule  would  serve no public purpose. All written comments and a summary
      of oral comments concerning a proposed rule received from the public  or
      any  agency  shall  be  placed  in  a  public record and be made readily
      available to the public as soon as practicable and in any event within a
      reasonable time, not to be delayed because of the continued pendency  of
      consideration  of the proposed rule. After consideration of the relevant
      comments presented, the agency  may  adopt  a  final  rule  pursuant  to
      subdivision  f  of  this section; except that, other than a rule adopted
      pursuant to subdivision i of  this  section,  no  final  rule  shall  be
      adopted  by such board or commission unless its final language is posted
      in a prominent location on  such  agency's  website  and  electronically
      transmitted  to  each  member of such board or commission at least three
      calendar days, exclusive of Sundays,  prior  to  such  rule's  adoption;
      provided,  however,  that  revisions  may  be made to a final rule posed
      online and sent electronically in conformity with  this  subdivision  at
      any  time  prior to the vote on such rule if such revisions are approved
      by all members of such board or commission by  unanimous  consent.  Such
      final rule may include revisions of the proposed rule, and such adoption
      of  revisions  based  on  the consideration of relevant agency or public
      comments shall not require further notice and comment pursuant  to  this
      section. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private right
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        f. Effective date. 1. No rule shall be effective until
        (a) the rule is filed by the agency with the corporation  counsel  for
      publication in the Compilation,
        (b)  the  rule  and a statement of basis and purpose is transmitted to
      the council for its information, and
        (c) the rule and a statement of basis and purpose have been  published
      in  the City Record and thirty days have elapsed after such publication.
      The  requirement  that  thirty  days  shall  first  elapse  after   such
      publication  shall not apply where a finding that a substantial need for
      the earlier implementation of a program or policy has been made  by  the
      agency  in  writing  and  has  been  approved  by the mayor prior to the
      effective date of the rule and such finding and approval is contained in
      the notice.
        2. A rule shall be void if it is not published in the next  supplement
      to  the  Compilation  in which its publication is practicable; provided,
      however, that in the case of an inadvertent failure to publish a rule in
      such supplement, the rule shall become effective as of the date  of  its
      publication,  if  it  is  published  within  six  months of the date the
    
      corporation  counsel  receives  notice  of  its  omission;  and  further
      provided  that  any  judicial  or  administrative  action or proceeding,
      whether criminal or civil, commenced under or by virtue of any provision
      of  a  rule  voided  pursuant  to this section and pending prior to such
      voidance, may be prosecuted and defended to final  effect  in  the  same
      manner as they might if such rule had not been so voided.
        g.  Petition  for rules. Any person may petition an agency to consider
      the adoption of any rule. Within sixty days after the  submission  of  a
      petition, the agency shall either deny such petition in writing, stating
      the  reasons  for  denial,  or  state the agency's intention to initiate
      rulemaking,  by  a  specified  date,  concerning  the  subject  of  such
      petition.  Each  agency  shall  prescribe  by  rule  the  procedure  for
      submission, consideration and disposition of such petitions. In the case
      of a board, commission or other body that is  not  headed  by  a  single
      person,  such  rules of procedure may authorize such body to delegate to
      its chair the authority to reject such petitions. Such decision shall be
      within the discretion of the agency and shall not be subject to judicial
      review.
        h. Maintenance of comments. Each agency shall establish a  system  for
      maintaining  and  making  available  for  public  inspection all written
      comments received in response to each notice of rulemaking.
        i. Emergency procedures. 1. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
      this section, an agency may adopt a rule prior to the notice and comment
      otherwise  required  by  this  section if the immediate effectiveness of
      such rule is necessary to address an imminent threat to health,  safety,
      property  or  a necessary service. A finding of such imminent threat and
      the specific reasons for the finding must be  made  in  writing  by  the
      agency adopting such rule and shall be approved by the mayor before such
      rule  may be made effective. In the event that an elected official other
      than the mayor has the authority to promulgate rules, such official  may
      make  such  findings  without  prior  mayoral  approval.  The  rule  and
      accompanying finding  shall  be  made  public  forthwith  and  shall  be
      published in the City Record as soon as practicable. Agencies shall also
      electronically  transmit  all  emergency  rules adopted pursuant to this
      paragraph to the office of the speaker of  the  council,  the  council's
      office  of  legislative documents, the corporation counsel, each council
      member, the chairs of all community boards, the  news  media  and  civic
      organizations, as such term is defined in subdivision b of this section,
      no  later  than the date the emergency rules are transmitted to the City
      Record for publication pursuant to this paragraph.
        2. A rule adopted on an emergency basis shall not remain in effect for
      longer than sixty days  unless  the  agency  has  initiated  notice  and
      comment  otherwise required by this section within such sixty day period
      and publishes with such notice a statement that  an  extension  of  such
      rule  on an emergency basis is necessary for an additional sixty days to
      afford an opportunity for notice and comment and to adopt a  final  rule
      as required by this section; provided that no further such finding of an
      emergency  may  be  made  with  respect  to  the same or a substantially
      similar rule.
