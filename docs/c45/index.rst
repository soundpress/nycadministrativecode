        §  1042.  Regulatory agenda. a. Each agency shall publish by the first
      day of May annually, a regulatory agenda which shall contain:
        1. a brief description of the subject areas in which it is anticipated
      that rules may be promulgated during the next fiscal year,  including  a
      description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered;
        2. a summary, to the extent known, of the anticipated contents of each
      such proposed rule, its objectives and legal basis;
        3. a description of the types of individuals and entities likely to be
      subject to the rule;
        4.  an  identification,  to  the  extent  practicable, of all relevant
      federal, state, and local laws and  rules,  including  those  which  may

      name and telephone number of an agency official knowledgeable about each
      subject area involved.
        b. Each agency the single head of which  is  appointed  by  the  mayor
      shall forward to the mayor its regulatory agenda. The mayor shall review
      such  regulatory agenda to determine whether regulations contemplated by
      city  agencies  are  consistent  with  the  policy  objectives  of   the
      administration.
        c.  Failure  to  include  an  item  in  a  regulatory agenda shall not
      preclude action thereon. If rulemaking is undertaken  on  a  matter  not
      included in the regulatory agenda the agency shall include in the notice
      of  proposed  rulemaking  the  reason  the rule was not anticipated. The
      inadvertent failure to provide the reason such rule was not included  in
      the regulatory agenda shall not serve to invalidate the rule.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 1043.
-------------

Section 1043. ::    
        
     
        §  1043.  Rulemaking.  a. Authority. Each agency is empowered to adopt
      rules necessary to carry out the powers and duties delegated to it by or
      pursuant to federal, state or local law. No agency shall  adopt  a  rule
      except pursuant to this section. Each such rule shall be simply written,
      using ordinary language where possible.
        b.  Notice. 1. Each agency shall publish the full text of the proposed
      rule in the City Record at least thirty days prior to the date set for a
      public hearing to be held pursuant to the requirements of subdivision  e
      of  this  section  or  the  final  date for receipt of written comments,
      whichever is earlier. A proposed rule amending an  existing  rule  shall
      contain  in brackets any part to be deleted and shall have underlined or
      italicized any new part to  be  added.  A  proposed  rule  repealing  an
      existing  rule  shall contain in brackets the rule to be repealed, or if
      the full text of the rule was published in the Compilation  required  to
      be published pursuant to section one thousand forty-five, shall give the
      citation  of the rule to be repealed and a summary of its contents. Such
      published notice shall include  a  draft  statement  of  the  basis  and
      purpose  of  the  proposed  rule, the statutory authority, including the
      particular sections and subdivisions upon which the action is based, the
      time and place of public hearing, if any, to be held or the reason  that
      a  public  hearing  will  not be held, and the final date for receipt of
      written  comments.  If  the  proposed  rule  was  not  included  in  the
      regulatory  agenda,  such  notice shall also include the reason the rule
      was not anticipated,  as  required  in  subdivision  c  of  section  one
      thousand forty-two of this chapter.
        2.   Copies   of   the  full  text  of  the  proposed  rule  shall  be
      electronically transmitted to the office of the speaker of the  council,
      the  council's office of legislative documents, the corporation counsel,
      each council member, the chairs of all community boards, the news  media
      and  civic  organizations  no  later  than the date the proposed rule is
      transmitted to the City Record for publication pursuant to paragraph one
      of subdivision b of this section; provided that an  inadvertent  failure
      to fully comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph shall not
      serve to invalidate any rule.
        3. (a) News media, for the purposes of this subdivision, shall include
      (i)  all  radio  and television stations broadcasting in the city of New
      York, all newspapers  published  in  the  city  of  New  York  having  a
      city-wide  or  borough-wide  circulation, and any newspaper of any labor
      union or trade association representing an  industry  affected  by  such
      rule,  and  (ii)  any  community newspaper or any other publication that
      requests such notification on an annual basis.
        (b) Civic organizations, for the purposes of this  subdivision,  shall
      include  any  city-wide or borough-wide organization or any labor union,
      trade association or other group that requests such notification  on  an
      annual basis.
        4.  In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph one of this
      subdivision, each agency shall provide information regarding the  public
      hearing  to  be  held  with  regard  to  a  proposed rule in a prominent
      location on such agency's website at least seven days prior to the  date
      set  for such hearing. Each agency shall further provide, in a prominent
      location on such agency's website, a link to the NYC Rules online portal
      or any successor city website or page that is substantially  similar  in
      form or function. Each agency shall, to the greatest extent practicable,
      and  in  addition  to the electronic transmissions required by paragraph
      two  of  this  subdivision,  publicize  upcoming  public  hearings   via
      electronic  means  that  are  likely  to reach interested members of the
      public. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private  right
    
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        c. Review of statutory authority. The corporation counsel shall review
      the  proposed  rule  to  determine  whether  it  is within the authority
      delegated by law to the agency proposing the rule.  If  the  corporation
      counsel  determines  that  the  proposed rule is not within the agency's
      delegated authority, the corporation counsel shall notify the agency  in
      writing prior to the publication of the final rule in the City Record.
        d.  1.  The  law department and the mayor's office of operations shall
      review each proposed rule prior to publication of such proposed rule  in
      the  City  Record.  At  the conclusion of its review, the law department
      shall state whether  each  proposed  rule:  (i)  is  drafted  so  as  to
      accomplish the purpose of the authorizing provisions of law; (ii) is not
      in conflict with other applicable rules; (iii) to the extent practicable
      and  appropriate,  is  narrowly drawn to achieve its stated purpose; and
      (iv) to the extent practicable and appropriate, contains a statement  of
      basis  and purpose that provides a clear explanation of the rule and the
      requirements imposed by the rule. As part of  its  review,  the  mayor's
      office  of  operations  shall  analyze each proposed rule and state: (a)
      whether such rule is understandable and written in plain  language;  (b)
      how  the  drafting  process  of  the rule, to the extent practicable and
      appropriate, included analysis sufficient  to  minimize  the  compliance
      costs for the discrete regulated community or communities, to the extent
      one  exists,  consistent  with achieving the stated purpose of the rule;
      and (c) why, in the event such rule  involves  the  establishment  of  a
      violation,  modification of a violation or modification of the penalties
      associated with a violation without also including  a  cure  period,  or
      other  opportunity  for  ameliorative  action  by  the  party or parties
      subject to enforcement,  such  cure  period  or  other  opportunity  for
      ameliorative  action  was  not  included. Provided, however, that if the
      proposed rule solely establishes or modifies the amount  of  a  monetary
      penalty  or penalties then the law department statement required by this
      paragraph shall not be required  and  the  analysis  of  the  office  of
      operations  may  be  limited  to  the reason or reasons a cure period or
      other opportunity for ameliorative action was not included.
        2. After completing the review as set forth in paragraph one  of  this
      subdivision,  the  law  department  and the mayor's office of operations
      shall certify that they have performed such review, and  shall  promptly
      transmit  a copy of such certification, including the analysis performed
      by the mayor's office of operations, to the relevant agency. Such agency
      shall annex such certification and analysis to  the  full  text  of  the
      proposed  rule  as  published in the City Record. Such certification and
      analysis shall also be made  available  to  the  public  on  the  city's
      website  and  transmitted to the speaker of the city council at the time
      of publication. In no event shall  a  proposed  rule  be  submitted  for
      initial publication in the City Record unless the law department and the
      mayor's   office  of  operations  have  issued  such  certification  and
      analysis.
        3. This subdivision shall not be construed to create a  private  right
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this subdivision shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        4. This subdivision shall not apply to rules that: (i) are promulgated
      pursuant to the emergency procedures set forth in subdivision i of  this
      section;   (ii)   are   solely   concerned  with  the  establishment  or
      modification of the amount of a monetary penalty or penalties,  and  the
      underlying  violation or a modification of the penalties associated with
      such violation has previously been analyzed in accordance with paragraph
      one  of  this  subdivision;  (iii)  are  solely   concerned   with   the
    
      establishment  or  modification  of  the amount of a fee or fees or (iv)
      implement particular mandates or standards set forth  in  newly  enacted
      federal,  state,  or  local laws, regulations or other requirements with
      only  minor,  if any, exercise of agency discretion in interpreting such
      mandates or standards.  If  an  analysis  of  a  proposed  rule  is  not
      performed  pursuant to the exceptions noted in this paragraph, such fact
      shall be noted and the note annexed to the full  text  of  the  proposed
      rule as published in the City Record.
        e. Opportunity for and consideration of agency and public comment. The
      agency  shall  provide  the  public  an  opportunity  to  comment on the
      proposed rule (i) through outreach to the discrete  regulated  community
      or  communities,  if  one exists, provided that this clause shall not be
      construed  to  create  a  private  right  of  action  to  enforce   this
      requirement;   (ii)  through  submission  of  written  data,  views,  or
      arguments, and (iii) at a public hearing unless it is determined by  the
      agency  in  writing,  which shall be published in the notice of proposed
      rulemaking in the City Record, that such a public hearing on a  proposed
      rule  would  serve no public purpose. All written comments and a summary
      of oral comments concerning a proposed rule received from the public  or
      any  agency  shall  be  placed  in  a  public record and be made readily
      available to the public as soon as practicable and in any event within a
      reasonable time, not to be delayed because of the continued pendency  of
      consideration  of the proposed rule. After consideration of the relevant
      comments presented, the agency  may  adopt  a  final  rule  pursuant  to
      subdivision  f  of  this section; except that, other than a rule adopted
      pursuant to subdivision i of  this  section,  no  final  rule  shall  be
      adopted  by such board or commission unless its final language is posted
      in a prominent location on  such  agency's  website  and  electronically
      transmitted  to  each  member of such board or commission at least three
      calendar days, exclusive of Sundays,  prior  to  such  rule's  adoption;
      provided,  however,  that  revisions  may  be made to a final rule posed
      online and sent electronically in conformity with  this  subdivision  at
      any  time  prior to the vote on such rule if such revisions are approved
      by all members of such board or commission by  unanimous  consent.  Such
      final rule may include revisions of the proposed rule, and such adoption
      of  revisions  based  on  the consideration of relevant agency or public
      comments shall not require further notice and comment pursuant  to  this
      section. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private right
      of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
      this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
        f. Effective date. 1. No rule shall be effective until
        (a) the rule is filed by the agency with the corporation  counsel  for
      publication in the Compilation,
        (b)  the  rule  and a statement of basis and purpose is transmitted to
      the council for its information, and
        (c) the rule and a statement of basis and purpose have been  published
      in  the City Record and thirty days have elapsed after such publication.
      The  requirement  that  thirty  days  shall  first  elapse  after   such
      publication  shall not apply where a finding that a substantial need for
      the earlier implementation of a program or policy has been made  by  the
      agency  in  writing  and  has  been  approved  by the mayor prior to the
      effective date of the rule and such finding and approval is contained in
      the notice.
        2. A rule shall be void if it is not published in the next  supplement
      to  the  Compilation  in which its publication is practicable; provided,
      however, that in the case of an inadvertent failure to publish a rule in
      such supplement, the rule shall become effective as of the date  of  its
      publication,  if  it  is  published  within  six  months of the date the
    
      corporation  counsel  receives  notice  of  its  omission;  and  further
      provided  that  any  judicial  or  administrative  action or proceeding,
      whether criminal or civil, commenced under or by virtue of any provision
      of  a  rule  voided  pursuant  to this section and pending prior to such
      voidance, may be prosecuted and defended to final  effect  in  the  same
      manner as they might if such rule had not been so voided.
        g.  Petition  for rules. Any person may petition an agency to consider
      the adoption of any rule. Within sixty days after the  submission  of  a
      petition, the agency shall either deny such petition in writing, stating
      the  reasons  for  denial,  or  state the agency's intention to initiate
      rulemaking,  by  a  specified  date,  concerning  the  subject  of  such
      petition.  Each  agency  shall  prescribe  by  rule  the  procedure  for
      submission, consideration and disposition of such petitions. In the case
      of a board, commission or other body that is  not  headed  by  a  single
      person,  such  rules of procedure may authorize such body to delegate to
      its chair the authority to reject such petitions. Such decision shall be
      within the discretion of the agency and shall not be subject to judicial
      review.
        h. Maintenance of comments. Each agency shall establish a  system  for
      maintaining  and  making  available  for  public  inspection all written
      comments received in response to each notice of rulemaking.
        i. Emergency procedures. 1. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
      this section, an agency may adopt a rule prior to the notice and comment
      otherwise  required  by  this  section if the immediate effectiveness of
      such rule is necessary to address an imminent threat to health,  safety,
      property  or  a necessary service. A finding of such imminent threat and
      the specific reasons for the finding must be  made  in  writing  by  the
      agency adopting such rule and shall be approved by the mayor before such
      rule  may be made effective. In the event that an elected official other
      than the mayor has the authority to promulgate rules, such official  may
      make  such  findings  without  prior  mayoral  approval.  The  rule  and
      accompanying finding  shall  be  made  public  forthwith  and  shall  be
      published in the City Record as soon as practicable. Agencies shall also
      electronically  transmit  all  emergency  rules adopted pursuant to this
      paragraph to the office of the speaker of  the  council,  the  council's
      office  of  legislative documents, the corporation counsel, each council
      member, the chairs of all community boards, the  news  media  and  civic
      organizations, as such term is defined in subdivision b of this section,
      no  later  than the date the emergency rules are transmitted to the City
      Record for publication pursuant to this paragraph.
        2. A rule adopted on an emergency basis shall not remain in effect for
      longer than sixty days  unless  the  agency  has  initiated  notice  and
      comment  otherwise required by this section within such sixty day period
      and publishes with such notice a statement that  an  extension  of  such
      rule  on an emergency basis is necessary for an additional sixty days to
      afford an opportunity for notice and comment and to adopt a  final  rule
      as required by this section; provided that no further such finding of an
      emergency  may  be  made  with  respect  to  the same or a substantially
      similar rule.

        §   1044.  Review  of  previously  adopted  rules.  a.  Submission  of
      previously adopted rules. 1.  By  the  tenth  day  of  August,  nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine, each agency shall send to the corporation counsel a
      copy  of  each  rule,  as  defined  in  subdivision  five of section one
      thousand forty-one, in force as of the first day of January of  nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine. Each such rule shall be identified by the agency as
      one of the following:
        (a) a rule which should be continued in its present form;
        (b) a rule which should be continued with amendments; or
        (c) a rule which should be repealed.
        2.  Any  amendment  or  repeal of a rule described in paragraph one of
      this subdivision, shall be  subject  to  the  provisions  set  forth  in
      section one thousand forty-three.
        b.  In regard to all rules submitted pursuant to subdivision a of this
      section, the corporation counsel shall
        1. include such rules in the  Compilation  required  to  be  published
      pursuant  to  section  one  thousand forty-five; provided, however, that
      each rule which  the  agency  identifies  as  a  rule  which  should  be
      continued but with amendments, and each rule which the agency identifies
      as  a  rule  which  should  be  repealed,  shall  be  published  in  the
      Compilation with an appropriate notation as to the agency's comments and
      intentions.  Such notations shall be provided for informational purposes
      only and such rule in its present form shall remain in  full  force  and
      effect until and unless such rule is amended or repealed pursuant to the
      procedures set forth in section one thousand forty-three, and
        2.  submit  to  the  City  Record  for publication by the first day of
      September, nineteen hundred ninety, a list of rules  submitted  pursuant
      to  subdivisions  a and e of this section, except for rules contained in
      the health  code.  Such  list  shall  include  for  each  rule  a  short
      descriptive  title, as well as any available identifying names, numbers,
      adoption dates or  similar  information  regarding  such  rule;  and  an
      indication  of  the  agency's  intention  to  continue such rule without
      amendments, to continue it with amendments or to repeal it.
        c. No rule, as defined in subdivision five  of  section  one  thousand
      forty-one,  which  is  in force as of the first day of January, nineteen
      hundred eighty-nine shall have any force or effect on or after the tenth
      day of August, nineteen hundred and eighty-nine unless it  is  submitted
      by the agency to the corporation counsel by such date.
        d.  Except as provided in subdivision e, no rule adopted by any agency
      prior to the effective date of this chapter  shall  have  any  force  or
      effect  after  the first day of July, nineteen hundred ninety-one unless
      it is included in the Compilation required to be published by that  date
      pursuant  to  section  one thousand forty-five; provided however that in
      the  case  of  an  inadvertent  failure  to  publish  a  rule  in   such
      Compilation,  the  rule  shall  become  effective  as of the date of its
      publication, if it is published within six  months  from  the  date  the
      corporation  counsel  received  notice  of  its  omission,  and  further
      provided that any  judicial  or  administrative  action  or  proceeding,
      whether criminal or civil, commenced under or by virtue of any provision
      of  a  rule  voided  pursuant  to this section and pending prior to such
      voidance, may be prosecuted and defended to final  effect  in  the  same
      manner as they might if such rule had not been so voided.
        e.  On  or before a date one hundred eighty days after the publication
      date of the Compilation required to be published pursuant to section one
      thousand forty-five, any person may submit to the agency involved a copy
      or a description of a rule which such person believes to be in force  as
      of the effective date of this chapter. Upon the receipt of a description
      or  copy  of  such  a  rule,  the  agency  shall  endeavor to verify the
    
      existence of such rule and upon identifying such rule, if such rule  was
      in force and effect as of the effective date of this chapter and has not
      been  submitted  to the corporation counsel pursuant to subdivision a of
      this  section,  the  agency  shall take the actions required pursuant to
      subdivision a of this section, and  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
      subdivisions  c  and  d of this section, such rule shall remain in force
      and effect until or unless amended or repealed pursuant to  section  one
      thousand forty-three.

        §  1045.  Compilation  of city rules. a. The corporation counsel shall
      publish a Compilation of city rules and thereafter keep such Compilation
      up to date through supplements issued at least every six months  and  at
      such  other  times  as  the  corporation  counsel  shall  determine. The
      Compilation and its supplements shall be certified  by  the  corporation
      counsel   and   shall  include  every  rule  currently  in  effect.  The
      Compilation and its supplements may contain such  other  information  as
      the  corporation  counsel  deems  necessary  and  appropriate  for  full
      understanding of any rule or which the corporation counsel in his or her
      discretion determines may be of interest or assistance  to  the  public.
      The  Compilation  and  its  supplements shall be organized by agency and
      indexed by subject matter. An indexed edition of the  Compilation  shall
      be  published by the first day of July, nineteen hundred and ninety-one,
      which date shall be deemed the publication date of the Compilation,  and
      shall  be  updated  and  republished  by the first day of March of every
      fourth year thereafter.
        b. The rules contained within  the  Compilation  and  its  supplements
      shall  be certified by the corporation counsel and shall be the rules of
      the city unless added to, amended or repealed in accordance with section
      ten hundred forty-three  of  the  charter.  Materials  included  in  the
      Compilation  may be edited, rearranged and updated for clarity, accuracy
      and reorganization  without  change  in  substance.    Section  numbers,
      stylistic and organizational formats and other non-substantive revisions
      to the rules effected by the law department pursuant to this subdivision
      shall  become  effective  on the publication date of the Compilation and
      upon the publication of each supplement.
        c. Documents submitted by an  agency  pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
      section  ten  hundred  forty-four of the charter which were not formally
      adopted by the agency as rules pursuant to section eleven  hundred  five
      of  the  charter as in effect prior to November eighth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-eight shall either be included in the Compilation or filed in the
      municipal reference and research center in the  manner  provided  below.
      All  documents  which the corporation counsel, in his or her discretion,
      determines should not be included in the Compilation shall be  organized
      by  agency and subject matter in a form which shall be easily accessible
      to the public and filed by the  corporation  counsel  in  the  municipal
      reference and research center on or prior to July first nineteen hundred
      ninety-one.  Notice  of  such  filing  and a list of the documents filed
      shall be published in the City Record. Notwithstanding any  inconsistent
      provision  of section ten hundred forty-four of the charter, any of such
      documents so filed shall, if otherwise valid, continue to  be  effective
      provided, however, that the amendment or repeal of any document which is
      within  the  definition of rule set forth in subdivision five of section
      ten hundred forty-one of the charter shall be in accordance with section
      ten hundred forty-three of the charter.
