      including reference to the particular sections of law and rule involved.
        b.  Notice  of agency procedures. Agencies shall adopt rules governing
      agency procedures for adjudications and appeals. Agencies shall  make  a

      the agency.
        c.  Hearing.  1.  All  parties  shall be afforded an opportunity for a
      hearing within a reasonable time. At the hearing the  parties  shall  be
      afforded due process of law, including the opportunity to be represented
      by  counsel, to issue subpoenas or request that a subpoena be issued, to
      call witnesses, to cross-examine opposing witnesses and to present  oral
      and written arguments on the law and facts. Adherence to formal rules of
      evidence  is  not required. No ex parte communications relating to other
      than ministerial matters regarding a proceeding shall be received  by  a
      hearing  officer,  including internal agency directives not published as
      rules.
        2. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the  record  of  the
      proceeding  as  a  whole.  Except  as otherwise provided for by state or

      of proof.
        3.  The  hearing  shall  be  transcribed or recorded and a copy of the
      transcript or record, or any part thereof, shall be  made  available  to

        e.  Hearing  officer. Except as otherwise provided for by this charter
      the  person  presiding  at  a  hearing  shall  be  assigned  solely   to
      adjudicative and related duties. Except as otherwise provided for by the
      rules  of  the agency or by order of the mayor issued in accordance with
      subdivisions two and three of section  one  thousand  forty-eight,  such
      hearing officer shall make final findings of fact and shall not make any
      final  decision, determination, or order, but shall only recommend such,
      and shall forward such recommendation and the record of the adjudication
      to the agency, who may adopt, reject  or  modify  any  such  recommended
      decision, determination or order.
        f.   Recommendation  or  decision.  Any  recommended  decision,  final
