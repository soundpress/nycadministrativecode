Section 1045. ::    
        
     
        §  1045.  Compilation  of city rules. a. The corporation counsel shall
      publish a Compilation of city rules and thereafter keep such Compilation
      up to date through supplements issued at least every six months  and  at
      such  other  times  as  the  corporation  counsel  shall  determine. The
      Compilation and its supplements shall be certified  by  the  corporation
      counsel   and   shall  include  every  rule  currently  in  effect.  The
      Compilation and its supplements may contain such  other  information  as
      the  corporation  counsel  deems  necessary  and  appropriate  for  full
      understanding of any rule or which the corporation counsel in his or her
      discretion determines may be of interest or assistance  to  the  public.
      The  Compilation  and  its  supplements shall be organized by agency and
      indexed by subject matter. An indexed edition of the  Compilation  shall
      be  published by the first day of July, nineteen hundred and ninety-one,
      which date shall be deemed the publication date of the Compilation,  and
      shall  be  updated  and  republished  by the first day of March of every
      fourth year thereafter.
        b. The rules contained within  the  Compilation  and  its  supplements
      shall  be certified by the corporation counsel and shall be the rules of
      the city unless added to, amended or repealed in accordance with section
      ten hundred forty-three  of  the  charter.  Materials  included  in  the
      Compilation  may be edited, rearranged and updated for clarity, accuracy
      and reorganization  without  change  in  substance.    Section  numbers,
      stylistic and organizational formats and other non-substantive revisions
      to the rules effected by the law department pursuant to this subdivision
      shall  become  effective  on the publication date of the Compilation and
      upon the publication of each supplement.
        c. Documents submitted by an  agency  pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
      section  ten  hundred  forty-four of the charter which were not formally
      adopted by the agency as rules pursuant to section eleven  hundred  five
      of  the  charter as in effect prior to November eighth, nineteen hundred
      eighty-eight shall either be included in the Compilation or filed in the
      municipal reference and research center in the  manner  provided  below.
      All  documents  which the corporation counsel, in his or her discretion,
      determines should not be included in the Compilation shall be  organized
      by  agency and subject matter in a form which shall be easily accessible
      to the public and filed by the  corporation  counsel  in  the  municipal
      reference and research center on or prior to July first nineteen hundred
      ninety-one.  Notice  of  such  filing  and a list of the documents filed
      shall be published in the City Record. Notwithstanding any  inconsistent
      provision  of section ten hundred forty-four of the charter, any of such
      documents so filed shall, if otherwise valid, continue to  be  effective
      provided, however, that the amendment or repeal of any document which is
      within  the  definition of rule set forth in subdivision five of section
      ten hundred forty-one of the charter shall be in accordance with section
      ten hundred forty-three of the charter.
