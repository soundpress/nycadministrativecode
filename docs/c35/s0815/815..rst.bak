      departments or offices, without reference to the tenure of office of any
      appointee  and  to  assign  them  their  duties. Nothing herein shall be
      construed  to  preclude  the  mayor  from  entering  into  a  collective
      bargaining  agreement  which  provides  for  a  procedure  governing the
      discipline of employees, including their removal,  pursuant  to  section
      12-312  of the administrative code of the city of New York for employees

      retention, recruitment, training  and  promotional  program  literature,
    
      advertisements, solicitations and job applications, such language as may
      be necessary to effectuate the purpose of this chapter.
        k.  The head of each city agency shall require each employment agency,
      or authorized representative of workers with which it has  a  collective
      bargaining  or other agreement or understanding and which is involved in
      the performance of recruitment and retention with the agency to  furnish
      a  written  statement  that  such  employment  agency,  labor  union  or
      representative shall not discriminate against  employees  or  applicants
      for  employment  pursuant  to  federal, state or local law and that such
