        §  824. Real property. With respect to real property, the commissioner
      shall have the following powers and duties:
        (a) to purchase, lease, condemn or otherwise acquire real property for
      the city, subject to the approval of the  mayor,  and  to  sell,  lease,
      exchange  or  otherwise dispose of real property of the city, subject to
      the requirements of section three hundred  eighty-four  and  subject  to
      review  and approval either pursuant to section one hundred ninety-five,
      if applicable, or pursuant to sections one  hundred  ninety-seven-c  and
      one  hundred  ninety-seven-d.  No  such purchase, lease, condemnation or
      other acquisition shall be authorized until a public  hearing  has  been
      held  with respect to such acquisition after the publishing of notice in
      the City Record at least ten days but  not  more  than  thirty  days  in
      advance  of  such  hearing;  provided,  however,  that in the case of an
      acquisition by purchase  or  condemnation,  no  such  hearing  shall  be
      required  if  a  public hearing is held with respect to such purchase or
      condemnation pursuant to any other requirement of law. In the case of  a
      lease  in which the city is to be the tenant, the notice for the hearing
      required in this subdivision shall include a statement of  the  location
      and  proposed  use  of the premises, and the term and annual rent of the
      proposed lease. Before submitting an application pursuant to section one
      hundred ninety-seven-c for an acquisition or a disposition  pursuant  to
      this  section,  the  commissioner  shall  take  into  consideration  the
      criteria for location of city facilities established pursuant to section
      two hundred three. If two years, not including time spent in litigation,
      have  elapsed  between  (1)  the  final  approval  of  a  dispostion  or
      acquisition  pursuant  to section one hundred ninety-seven-c and section
      one  hundred  ninety-seven-d  and  (2)  execution  of  an  agreement  in
      connection  with  such dispostion or acquisition, a public hearing shall
      be held on the proposed acquisition or disposition after the  publishing
      of notice in the City Record at least forty-five days in advance of such
      hearing;
        (b)  to assign and reallocate to city agencies space and real property
      owned or leased by the city, to establish comprehensive  and  continuing
      programs  and  standards for utilization of space owned or leased by the
      city and to conduct surveys of space utilization;
        (c) to manage all real property  of  the  city  not  used  for  public
      purposes,  including real property acquired for a public purpose and not
      being currently utilized for such  purpose,  except  wharf  property  or
      other  real  property  under the jurisdiction of the department of small
      business  services,  the  department   of   housing   preservation   and
      development,  the New York city transit authority, and the New York city
      housing authority by virtue of an authorization  granted  by  the  mayor
      pursuant  to  the provisions of subdivision three of section one hundred
      twenty-five of the public housing law, or except as  otherwise  provided
      by  law,  real  property under the jurisdiction of the triborough bridge
      and  tunnel  authority;  provided,  that  the  commissioner   shall   be
      responsible  for the management, leasing or permitting of any parcels of
      wharf property and water front property as provided in  any  designation
      made  by  the  commissioner  of  small  business  services  pursuant  to
      paragraph b of subdivision two of section thirteen hundred one  of  this
      charter;
        (d)  to  exercise  and  perform such other powers and duties as may be
      prescribed by law or delegated to the commissioner in  relation  to  the
      acquisition,   disposition,   management,  site  selection,  assignment,
      demolition or other treatment of real property of the city;
        (e) to  employ,  where  desirable,  managing  agents  to  manage  city
      properties and collect rents therefrom and pay bills;
    
        (f)  to  keep,  maintain  and  annually update a master list of leases
      wherein the city or its agencies is a tenant.  Such  master  list  shall
      contain  at least the following information: name and address of lessor,
