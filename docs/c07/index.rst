      or,  if  determined  to  be unlawful, the same shall be ordered stricken
      from the roll or where appropriate entered on the exempt portion of  the

      correct class designation or allocation of assessed valuation  shall  be
      entered on the roll.

      of  income  and  expenses  is not filed as part of the application, such
      statement, when duly verified, shall be filed prior to the  twenty-fifth

      as the dates contained therein are inconsistent with the dates set forth
      in this section.
        d.  Whenever  such  a reduction is granted after a final completion of
      the assessment roll any tax imposed upon the amount  of  such  reduction

Section 168. ::    
        
     
        §  168.  Tribunal  for  tax  appeals.  a.  An  independent tax appeals
      tribunal is hereby established. Such tribunal shall be within the office
      of administrative tax appeals  established  under  section  one  hundred
      fifty  of this charter. The tribunal shall have jurisdiction to hear and
      determine cases initiated by the filing of petitions protesting  notices
      issued  by the commissioner of finance, which give a person the right to
      a hearing, including but not limited to any notice of  determination  of
      tax  due,  of  a  tax  deficiency,  of  a  denial  of a refund or credit
      application or of the refusal to grant, the suspension or the revocation
      of a license issued pursuant to chapter thirteen of title eleven of  the
      administrative  code,  which notices relate to nonproperty taxes, excise
      taxes and annual vault charges imposed by the city, except  those  taxes
      and  charges administered by the State of New York on behalf of the City
      of New York. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the commissioner
      of finance fails to act with respect to a refund application before  the
      expiration  of  the  time  period  after  which  the taxpayer may file a
      petition for refund with the tribunal pursuant  to  subdivision  (c)  of
      section   11-529   or   subdivision  three  of  section  11-680  of  the
      administrative code, such failure shall be deemed  to  be  a  notice  of
      denial  of  a  refund  issued by the commissioner of finance pursuant to
      such  subdivision.  The  tribunal  shall  review  petitions  and   other
      documents  submitted  to  it,  hold  hearings,  and  render decisions as
      provided in this chapter. In rendering its decisions on claims  asserted
      by taxpayers or the commissioner of finance, the tribunal shall have the
      same  power  and  authority  as  the  commissioner of finance to impose,
      modify or waive any taxes within its jurisdiction, interest thereon, and
      any applicable civil penalties. In appeals in which  the  rules  of  the
      commissioner  of finance are at issue, the tribunal shall have the power
      and authority to rule on the legality of such rules.
        b. The tribunal shall be composed of three commissioners, each of whom
      shall be appointed by the mayor. The mayor shall designate  one  of  the
      three  commissioners  as  president  of the tribunal, who shall serve as
      president during his or her term as commissioner. The president  of  the
      tribunal, in addition to performing his or her duties as a commissioner,
      shall  be in charge of the administration and operation of the tribunal.
      Each commissioner shall serve a term of  six  years,  except  the  mayor
      shall  specify  in  the  case of the first three commissioners appointed
      that (i) the term of one of those commissioners  shall  expire  on  June
      thirtieth,  nineteen hundred and ninety-two, (ii) the term of another of
      those commissioners shall expire on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and
      ninety-four, and (iii) the term of the commissioner designated president
      shall expire on June thirtieth, nineteen  hundred  and  ninety-six.  The
      mayor may remove any commissioner from the tribunal for neglect of duty,
      for   inability   to  perform  duties  because  of  mental  or  physical
      disability, for malfeasance or for any other just cause, after providing
      such commissioner prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. The mayor
      shall  fill  any  vacancy  in  the  tribunal  occurring  other  than  by
      expiration   of   term  in  the  same  manner  as  for  making  original
      appointments, except an appointment to fill a vacancy  shall  expire  at
      the  end  of  the  term  of the commissioner whose departure created the
      vacancy. The number of commissioners on the tribunal may be increased by
      local law.
        c. No person shall be appointed as a commissioner unless  that  person
      possesses  substantial  knowledge and competence in the area of taxation
      and has been admitted to practice as an attorney in  the  State  of  New
      York  for at least ten years. Every commissioner, while in office, shall
      give his or her whole time to the duties of the office,  and  shall  not
      engage  in  the  practice  of  law  or  other  occupation, profession or
    
      employment. Each commissioner shall receive an annual salary in the same
      amount as is payable to a judge of the civil court of the  City  of  New
      York.  A commissioner's annual salary shall not be diminished during his
      or her term of office.
        d.  The  president  of  the  tribunal shall appoint administrative law
      judges, subject to appropriations therefor, who shall be  authorized  to
      conduct  any  hearing or motion procedure within the jurisdiction of the
      tribunal, subject to en banc review by the tribunal. Each administrative
      law judge shall be an attorney admitted to practice in the state of  New
      York  for  at  least  five  years or are currently employed as a hearing
      officer in the department of  finance.  Each  administrative  law  judge
      shall  be appointed pursuant to the civil service law. The president may
      designate  one  of  the  administrative  law  judges  to  be  the  chief
      administrative law judge, having such powers as are prescribed under the
      rules  of  the tribunal. A determination issued by an administrative law
      judge shall finally decide the matters in controversy unless  any  party
      to  the  hearing  takes  exception  by timely requesting a review by the
      tribunal sitting en banc as provided for by rules adopted under  section
      one   hundred  sixty-nine  of  the  charter.  Determinations  issued  by
      administrative law judges shall not be cited, shall not be considered as
      precedent nor given  any  force  or  effect  in  any  other  proceedings
      conducted  by  the  tribunal or in any judicial proceedings conducted in
      this state.
        e. The president of the tribunal  shall  appoint  presiding  officers,
      subject  to  appropriations therefor, who shall be authorized to conduct
      small claims hearings  under  a  procedural  system  to  be  established
      pursuant  to  subdivision  e  of  section  one hundred sixty-nine of the
      charter. The qualifications for the position of presiding officer  shall
      be  determined by rules adopted pursuant to subdivision e of section one
      hundred sixty-nine of the charter, and each presiding officer  shall  be
      appointed pursuant to the civil service law.
        f.  The  tribunal  shall  collect, compile and prepare for publication
      statistics and other data with respect  to  its  operations,  and  shall
      submit annually to the mayor a report on such operations, including, but
      not  limited  to,  the  number  of  proceedings  initiated, the types of
      dispositions made and the number of proceedings pending.

        §  169.  Rules  of  tribunal.  Pursuant  to chapter forty-five of this
      charter, the tribunal shall promulgate rules of procedure,  which  shall
      include, but not be limited to, rules on the following matters:
        a.  The  types  of  representatives,  such as accountants and enrolled
      agents enrolled to practice before the internal revenue service, who may
      appear, in addition to lawyers, on behalf of  a  petitioner  before  the
      tribunal;
        b.  The  form  and  contents  of  the petition, answer, affidavits and
      memoranda  to  be  submitted  to  the  tribunal,  and  reasonable   time
      limitations for serving and filing such papers;
        c.    A  procedure  for  promptly  hearing  and determining any matter
      concerning jeopardy assessments or predecision warrants based thereon;
        d. A procedural system  guaranteeing  a  hearing  in  compliance  with
      chapter  forty-five  of this charter. Such a system shall be designed to
      assign each petition filed with the tribunal to  an  administrative  law
      judge  who  shall hear and determine all matters pertaining to questions
      of law or fact. Such a system also shall  be  designed  to  require  the
      tribunal to review en banc at the request of any party the determination
      rendered  by  an  administrative  law  judge, provided, however, that if
      there is no such request for a review within thirty days of  the  giving
      of  notice  of  such determination by the administrative law judge, such
      determination shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues in the
      proceeding before the administrative law judge and shall be considered a
      final decision of the tribunal upon the expiration  of  such  thirty-day
      period,  except  that,  notwithstanding any other provision of law, such
      determination by the administrative law judge shall not  be  subject  to
      judicial  review.    Such  a system shall provide that the tribunal may,
      based upon the record of  the  hearing  before  the  administrative  law
      judge,  make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue a
      decision either affirming, reversing or modifying the  determination  of
      the  administrative  law  judge, or the tribunal may remand the case for
      additional proceedings before the administrative law judge,  as  it  may
      deem  appropriate.  The  tribunal  in  its  discretion  may  grant  oral
      argument. Such a system shall provide that when the tribunal  reviews  a
      matter  en  banc  it must have a majority present and that not less than
      two votes shall be necessary to take any  action.  Such  a  system  also
      shall  provide  for  a  pre-hearing  conference  at  which settlement is
      encouraged;  reasonable  discovery;  and  the   submission   of   papers
      addressing both the factual and legal merits in each proceeding;
        e.  A procedural system to be followed in cases in which the matter in
      controversy is ten thousand dollars or less, exclusive of  interest  and
      penalties.  Such  a system shall be designed to provide a simplified and
      informal procedure for such small  claims  proceedings.  The  option  to
      proceed   with  a  small  claims  hearing  shall  be  exercised  by  the
      petitioner. At any time prior to  the  conclusion  of  such  hearing,  a
      petitioner  may by written notice to the tribunal discontinue such small
      claims hearing and request that the matter be transferred to  a  hearing
      conducted  before  an  administrative  law judge. Such transfer shall be
      effectuated by such written notice  and  such  discontinuance  shall  be
      without prejudice to any subsequent hearing before an administrative law
      judge.  The  determination of the presiding officer conducting the small
      claims hearing shall be conclusive upon all parties, shall be considered
      a final decision of the tribunal and shall not be subject to  review  by
      the  tribunal sitting en banc or by any court of the state. However, the
      tribunal may order a rehearing upon proof or allegation of misconduct by
      the small claims presiding officer. Determinations issued  by  presiding
      officers  shall  not  be cited, shall not be considered as precedent nor
    
      given any force or effect in any  other  proceedings  conducted  by  the
      tribunal or in any judicial proceedings conducted in this state; and
        f.  A  method  for notifying taxpayers and the commissioner of finance
      of, and for publishing, the decisions of the tribunal.

Section 170. ::    
        
     
        §  170.  Commencing an appeal before the tribunal. a. Any taxpayer who
      has been issued a notice referred to in subdivision  a  of  section  one
      hundred  sixty-eight  of  the charter by the commissioner of finance may
      petition  the  tribunal  for  administrative  review.  To   commence   a
      proceeding,  such a taxpayer must, within ninety days after being issued
      the  notice  at  issue  by  the  commissioner  of  finance  or,  if  the
      commissioner   of  finance  has  established  a  conciliation  procedure
      pursuant to section 11-124 of the administrative code and  the  taxpayer
      has  requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within
      ninety days from the mailing of the conciliation decision or the date of
      the  commissioner's  confirmation   of   the   discontinuance   of   the
      conciliation proceeding, both (1) serve a petition upon the commissioner
      of finance and (2) file the petition with the tribunal.  Notwithstanding
      the  time  specified  in the preceding sentence for filing a petition, a
      petition for refund filed pursuant to subdivision (c) of section  11-529
      of  the  administrative  code  or subdivision three of section 11-680 of
      such code may be filed within the time specified in such subdivision (c)
      or such subdivision three.  The  tribunal  shall  not  extend  the  time
      limitations  for  commencing  a proceeding for any petitioner failing to
      comply with such time limitations.  The petition shall contain  a  plain
      and  concise  statement  of the facts and law on which the proceeding is
      based.
        b.  Within  thirty  days  after  service  of  the  petition   on   the
      commissioner  of  finance,  or within such longer period as the tribunal
      may prescribe by rule, the commissioner of finance shall serve and  file
      an  answer  responding  to  each  of the allegations in the petition and
      setting forth all affirmative defenses and requests for counter-relief.
        c.  The filing of a petition with the  tribunal  shall  stay  (1)  the
      collection  of  any taxes or annual vault charges and (2) the payment of
      any refund of taxes or annual vault charges, together with interest  and
      penalties,  which are the subject of the petition, provided, however, if
      the commissioner of finance finds that the assessment or collection of a
      tax, charge, penalty or interest will  be  jeopardized  by  delay,  such
      assessment or collection shall not be stayed.
        d.  Upon  assignment  of  a  petition  filed  with  the tribunal to an
      administrative law judge, such administrative law judge shall  hear  and
      determine  any  issues of fact or law. Unless otherwise provided by law,
      the party seeking relief as to each  issue  shall  bear  the  burden  of
      proof.  Upon  a request to the tribunal for review of a determination of
      an administrative law judge, the tribunal shall  proceed  in  accordance
      with  the rules adopted pursuant to subdivision d of section one hundred
      sixty-nine of the charter.  The tribunal shall follow as  precedent  the
      prior  precedential  decisions  of  the  tribunal  (but not of its small
      claims presiding officers), the New York State Tax Appeals  Tribunal  or
      of any federal or New York state court or the U.S. Supreme Court insofar
      as  those  decisions  pertain  to any substantive legal issues currently
      before the tribunal.
        e.  The  tribunal  shall  have  power  to  subpoena  and  require  the
      attendance  of  witnesses  and  the  production  of  books,  papers  and
      documents pertinent  to  the  proceedings  which  it  is  authorized  to
      conduct,  and  to  examine  them  in relation to any matter which it has
      power to investigate and to issue commissions  for  the  examination  of
      witnesses  who  are  out  of  the  state or unable to attend proceedings
      conducted pursuant to the authority of  the  tribunal  or  excused  from
      attendance at such proceedings. The tribunal may designate and authorize
      administrative  law  judges  and  other  officers  or  employees  of the
      tribunal to exercise any of the powers or perform any of  the  functions
      provided   for  in  this  subdivision.  A  subpoena  issued  under  this
    
      subdivision shall be regulated by the civil practice law and rules.  Any
      person who shall testify falsely in any proceeding conducted pursuant to
      the authority of the tribunal shall be  guilty  of  and  punishable  for
      perjury.
        f.  The  tribunal shall have power to provide that an attorney for any
      party at a hearing conducted before  an  administrative  law  judge  may
      issue a subpoena as provided in the civil practice law and rules.

        §  171.  Decisions  of  the  tribunal  and judicial review. a. (1) The
      determinations of the administrative law judges and the decisions of the
      tribunal sitting en banc shall be  in  writing.  Each  determination  or
      decision,  with  the  exception  of those rendered pursuant to the small
      claims procedure, shall contain findings of fact and conclusions of law.
      A final decision of the tribunal may (i) grant in whole or in  part  the
      relief  sought  by the petitioner and/or the commissioner of finance, or
      (ii) dismiss the petition or request for counter-relief  either  on  the
      merits or with leave to renew.
        (2)  An  administrative law judge shall render a determination after a
      hearing, within six months after  submission  of  briefs  subsequent  to
      completion  of such a hearing or, if such briefs are not submitted, then
      within six months after completion of such a  hearing.  Such  six  month
      period  may  be extended by the administrative law judge, for good cause
      shown, to no more than three additional months.   If the  administrative
      law  judge  fails to render a determination within such six month period
      (or  such  period  as  extended  pursuant  to  this  subdivision),   the
      petitioner for such hearing or the commissioner of finance, or both, may
      institute a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice
      law and rules to compel the issuance of such determination.
        (3)  A decision of the tribunal sitting en banc shall be issued within
      six months from the date of the request to  the  tribunal  for  en  banc
      review of an administrative law judge's determination, except that where
      oral  argument  is  granted  or written arguments are submitted such six
      month period will commence to run on the date that  such  oral  argument
      was  concluded  or  written argument received by the tribunal, whichever
      was later.
        b.  Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions d and  e  of  section
      one  hundred  sixty-nine  of the charter, each decision of the tribunal,
      shall finally and irrevocably  decide  all  the  issues  raised  in  the
      proceedings   before   it,  unless  the  petitioner  who  commenced  the
      proceeding seeks judicial review of any  such  decision  in  the  manner
      provided  in  article  seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules
      within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision.
        c. A decision of the tribunal shall be deemed to have been rendered on
      the postmarked date on the  decision  sent  by  certified  mail,  return
      receipt requested, to the address most recently provided to the tribunal
      by each of the parties to the proceeding.
        d.  The  tribunal  shall  not  participate in proceedings for judicial
      review of its decisions. The record to be reviewed in  such  proceedings
      for  judicial  review  include  but  not be limited to the notice of the
      commissioner of finance which was the subject of the petition filed with
      the tribunal, the determination of the  administrative  law  judge,  the
      decision  of  the  tribunal,  the stenographic transcript of the hearing
      before the administrative law judge and any exhibit or document admitted
      into evidence at any proceeding before the administrative law  judge  or
      the tribunal.

        § 172. Sanctions.
        a.  The  failure  of  any  party to appear for a conference or hearing
      without having obtained an extension from all the  opposing  parties  or
      the tribunal at least forty-eight hours in advance of such conference or
      hearing  shall  be grounds for the tribunal to enter a decision in favor
      of the opposing party or parties.
        b. The signing of any paper submitted to the  tribunal  constitutes  a
      certificate  by  the signer that the signer has read the paper, and that
      to the best of the signer's knowledge,  information  and  belief  formed
      after  reasonable  inquiry,  the  paper  is well grounded in fact and is
      warranted by existing law or a good faith argument  for  the  extension,
      modification,  or  reversal  of  existing law, and that the paper is not
      interposed for  any  improper  purpose,  such  as  to  harass  or  cause
      unnecessary  delay  or needless increase in the cost of the proceedings.
      If a paper is signed in violation of this section,  the  tribunal,  upon
      motion  or  upon  its  own  initiative, shall impose upon the person who
      signed the paper, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction,
      which may include an order to  pay  the  other  party  or  parties  such
      sanction.  The  amount of any sanction shall be related to the amount of
      reasonable expenses, including a reasonable attorney's fee, incurred  by
      the  other  party  or  parties  because  of the serving or filing of the
      paper.
