Chapter 1: Commission on Human Rights
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-101 Policy.* ::


In the city of New York, with its great cosmopolitan population, there is no greater danger to the health, morals, safety and welfare of the city and its inhabitants than the existence of groups prejudiced against one another and antagonistic to each other because of their actual or perceived differences, including those based on race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, caregiver status, sexual and reproductive health decisions, uniformed service, any lawful source of income, status as a victim of domestic violence or status as a victim of sex offenses or stalking, whether children are, may be or would be residing with a person or conviction or arrest record. The council hereby finds and declares that prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, and discrimination, bias-related violence or harassment and disorder occasioned thereby threaten the rights and proper privileges of its inhabitants and menace the institutions and foundation of a free democratic state. The council further finds and declares that gender-based harassment threatens the terms, conditions and privileges of employment. A city agency is hereby created with power to eliminate and prevent discrimination from playing any role in actions relating to employment, public accommodations, and housing and other real estate, and to take other actions against prejudice, intolerance, bigotry, discrimination, sexual harassment and bias-related violence or harassment as herein provided; and the commission established hereunder is hereby given general jurisdiction and power for such purposes.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, it shall not be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to discriminate on the ground of alienage or citizenship status, or to make any inquiry as to a person's alienage or citizenship status, or to give preference to a person who is a citizen or national of the United States over an equally qualified person who is an alien, when such discrimination is required or when such preference is expressly permitted by any law or regulation of the United States, the state of New York or the city, and when such law or regulation does not provide that state or local law may be more protective of aliens; provided, however, that this provision shall not prohibit inquiries or determinations based on alienage or citizenship status when such actions are necessary to obtain the benefits of a federal program. An applicant for a license or permit issued by the city may be required to be authorized to work in the United States whenever by law or regulation there is a limit on the number of such licenses or permits which may be issued.

15. Applicability; persons with disabilities.

   (a) Requirement to make reasonable accommodation to the needs of persons with disabilities. Except as provided in paragraph (b), it is an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person prohibited by the provisions of this section from discriminating on the basis of disability not to provide a reasonable accommodation to enable a person with a disability to satisfy the essential requisites of a job or enjoy the right or rights in question provided that the disability is known or should have been known by the covered entity.

   (b) Affirmative defense in disability cases. In any case where the need for reasonable accommodation is placed in issue, it shall be an affirmative defense that the person aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory practice could not, with reasonable accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites of the job or enjoy the right or rights in question.

   (c) Use of drugs or alcohol. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to prohibit a covered entity from (i) prohibiting the illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol at the workplace or on duty impairment from the illegal use of drugs or the use of alcohol, or (ii) conducting drug testing which is otherwise lawful.

16. [Repealed.]

17. Disparate impact. 

   a. An unlawful discriminatory practice based upon disparate impact is established when:

      (1) The commission or a person who may bring an action under chapter 4 or 5 of this title demonstrates that a policy or practice of a covered entity or a group of policies or practices of a covered entity results in a disparate impact to the detriment of any group protected by the provisions of this chapter; and

      (2) The covered entity fails to plead and prove as an affirmative defense that each such policy or practice bears a significant relationship to a significant business objective of the covered entity or does not contribute to the disparate impact; provided, however, that if the commission or such person who may bring an action demonstrates that a group of policies or practices results in a disparate impact, the commission or such person shall not be required to demonstrate which specific policies or practices within the group results in such disparate impact; provided further, that a policy or practice or group of policies or practices demonstrated to result in a disparate impact shall be unlawful where the commission or such person who may bring an action produces substantial evidence that an alternative policy or practice with less disparate impact is available to the covered entity and the covered entity fails to prove that such alternative policy or practice would not serve the covered entity as well. "Significant business objective" shall include, but not be limited to, successful performance of the job.

   b. The mere existence of a statistical imbalance between a covered entity's challenged demographic composition and the general population is not alone sufficient to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact violation unless the general population is shown to be the relevant pool for comparison, the imbalance is shown to be statistically significant and there is an identifiable policy or practice or group of policies or practices that allegedly causes the imbalance.

   c. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to mandate or endorse the use of quotas; provided, however, that nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the scope of the commission's authority pursuant to sections 8-115 and 8-120 of this chapter or to affect court-ordered remedies or settlements that are otherwise in accordance with law.

18. Unlawful boycott or blacklist. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice (i) for any person to discriminate against, boycott or blacklist or to refuse to buy from, sell to or trade with, any person, because of such person's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, disability, age, marital status, partnership status, sexual orientation, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status or of such person's partners, members, stockholders, directors, officers, managers, superintendents, agents, employees, business associates, suppliers or customers, or (ii) for any person willfully to do any act or refrain from doing any act which enables any such person to take such action. This subdivision shall not apply to:

   (a) Boycotts connected with labor disputes;

   (b) Boycotts to protest unlawful discriminatory practices; or

   (c) Any form of expression that is protected by the First Amendment.

19. Interference with protected rights. It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any person to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with, or attempt to coerce, intimidate, threaten or interfere with, any person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of such person having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected pursuant to this section.

20. Relationship or association. The provisions of this section set forth as unlawful discriminatory practices shall be construed to prohibit such discrimination against a person because of the actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, uniformed service or alienage or citizenship status of a person with whom such person has a known relationship or association.

21. Employment; an individual's unemployment.

   a. Prohibition of discrimination based on an individual's unemployment.

      (2) Nothing set forth in this subdivision shall be construed as prohibiting an employer, employment agency, or agent thereof, when making employment decisions with regard to hiring, compensation, or the terms, conditions or privileges of employment, from considering any substantially job-related qualifications, including but not limited to: a current and valid professional or occupational license; a certificate, registration, permit, or other credential; a minimum level of education or training; or a minimum level of professional, occupational, or field experience.

A "substantially job-related qualification" shall include, but not be limited to, a current and valid professional or occupational license; a certificate, registration, permit, or other credential; a minimum level of education or training; or a minimum level of professional, occupational, or field experience.

22. Employment; Pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition.

   (a) It shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for an employer to refuse to provide a reasonable accommodation, as defined in section 8-102, to the needs of an employee for the employee's pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition that will allow the employee to perform the essential requisites of the job, provided that such employee's pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical condition is known or should have been known by the employer. In any case pursuant to this subdivision where the need for reasonable accommodation is placed in issue, it shall be an affirmative defense that the person aggrieved by the alleged discriminatory practice could not, with reasonable accommodation, satisfy the essential requisites of the job.

Chapter 3: Civil Rights Demonstration Protection
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-301 Legislative declaration.* ::


It is hereby found that the letter and spirit of the constitution of the United States are being violated in some jurisdictions under color of law with the result that persons from this city and state, as well as from other states, are being subjected to discriminatory treatment in the exercise of their constitutional rights because of race or because they seek the removal of unconstitutional barriers to equal rights. Such persons, sometimes referred to as freedom riders and sit-ins, intent upon peaceful resistance to discrimination, segregation and the achievement of the constitutional rights of all persons in all jurisdictions of the United States, have suffered the stigma of criminal proceedings. It is hereby declared to be the policy of the city to remove or to neutralize by affording to such residents appropriate relief to the fullest extent possible, the effect upon residents of this city of such criminal proceedings, resulting from the attempted use of public transportation facilities and other places of public accommodation.






*§ 8-302 Removal of disability or disqualification.* ::


Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, no person shall be denied any license, right, benefit or privilege extended by this code, or suffer any other disability or disqualification thereunder, or be denied the right of employment by the city, solely because of any arrest, apprehension, detention, indictment or other accusation, arraignment, trial, conviction or any other aspect of conviction or adjudication of a crime had under the jurisdiction of the courts of any state or of the United States, which is founded on an act or acts arising out of any peaceful demonstration or other peaceful activity, the object of which is to resist discriminatory treatment in any place of public accommodation as defined by section 40 of the civil rights law, or to achieve equal rights for all persons regardless of race, creed, color or national origin.






Chapter 4: Civil Action To Eliminate Unlawful Discriminatory Practices
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-401 Legislative declaration.* ::


The council finds that certain forms of unlawful discrimination are systemic in nature rooted in the operating conditions or policies of a business or industry. The council finds that the existence of systemic discrimination poses a substantial threat to, and inflicts significant injury upon, the city that is economic, social and moral in character, and is distinct from the injury sustained by individuals as an incident of such discrimination. The council finds that the potential for systemic discrimination exists in all areas of public life and that employment, housing and public accommodations are among the areas in which the economic effects of systemic discrimination are exemplified. The existence of systemic discrimination impedes the optimal efficiency of the labor market by, among other things, causing decisions to employ, promote or discharge persons to be based upon reasons other than qualifications and competence. Such discrimination impedes the optimal efficiency of the housing market and retards private investments in certain neighborhoods by causing decisions to lease or sell housing accommodations to be based upon discriminatory factors and not upon ability and willingness to lease or purchase property. The council finds that the reduction in the efficiency of the labor, housing and commercial markets has a detrimental effect on the city's economy, thereby reducing revenues and increasing costs to the city. The council finds that such economic injury to the city severely diminishes its capacity to meet the needs of those persons living and working in, and visiting, the city. The council finds further that the social and moral consequences of systemic discrimination are similarly injurious to the city in that systemic discrimination polarizes the city's communities, demoralizes its inhabitants and creates disrespect for the law, thereby frustrating the city's efforts to foster mutual respect and tolerance among its inhabitants and to promote a safe and secure environment. The council finds that the potential consequences to the city of this form of discrimination requires that the corporation counsel be expressly given the authority to institute a civil action to enforce the city's human rights law so as to supplement administrative means to prevent or remedy injury to the city.






*§ 8-402 Civil action to eliminate unlawful discriminatory practices.* ::


a. Whenever there is reasonable cause to believe that a person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice that results in the denial to any person of the full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter 1 of this title, a civil action on behalf of the commission or the city may be commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction, by filing a complaint setting forth facts pertaining to such pattern or practice and requesting such relief as may be deemed necessary to insure the full enjoyment of the rights described in such chapter, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, damages, including punitive damages, and such other types of relief as are specified in subdivision a of section 8-120. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit (i) an aggrieved person from filing a complaint pursuant to section 8-109 or from commencing a civil action pursuant to chapter 5 of this title based upon the same facts pertaining to such a pattern or practice as are alleged in the civil action, or (ii) the commission from filing a commission-initiated complaint pursuant to section 8-109 alleging a pattern or practice of discrimination, provided that a civil action pursuant to this section shall not have previously been commenced.

b. A civil action commenced under this section must be commenced within three years after the alleged discriminatory practice occurred.

c. Such action may be instituted only by the corporation counsel, such attorneys employed by the city commission on human rights as are designated by the corporation counsel or other persons designated by the corporation counsel.








*§ 8-403 Investigation.* ::


The corporation counsel may initiate any investigation to ascertain such facts as may be necessary for the commencement of a civil action pursuant to section 8-402, and in connection therewith shall have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, to administer oaths and to examine such persons as are deemed necessary.








*§ 8-404 Civil penalty.* ::


In any civil action commenced pursuant to section 8-402, the trier of fact may, to vindicate the public interest, impose upon any person who is found to have engaged in a pattern or practice that results in the denial to any person of the full enjoyment of any right secured by chapter 1 of this title a civil penalty of not more than $250,000. In relation to determining the appropriate amount of civil penalties to be imposed pursuant to this section a liable party may plead and prove any relevant mitigating factor. Any civil penalties so recovered pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the city from recovering damages, including punitive damages, and other relief pursuant to section 8-402 in addition to civil penalties.






Chapter 5: Civil Action By Persons Aggrieved By Unlawful Discriminatory Practices
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-502 Civil action by persons aggrieved by unlawful discriminatory practices.* ::


a. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be a person aggrieved by an unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in chapter 1 of this title or by an act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a complaint with the city commission on human rights or with the state division of human rights with respect to such alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence. For purposes of this subdivision, the filing of a complaint with a federal agency pursuant to applicable federal law prohibiting discrimination which is subsequently referred to the city commission on human rights or to the state division of human rights pursuant to such law shall not be deemed to constitute the filing of a complaint under this subdivision.

b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision a of this section, where a complaint filed with the city commission on human rights or the state division on human rights is dismissed by the city commission on human rights pursuant to subdivisions a, b or c of section 8-113, or by the state division of human rights pursuant to subdivision 9 of section 297 of the executive law either for administrative convenience or on the grounds that such person's election of an administrative remedy is annulled, an aggrieved person shall maintain all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this chapter as if no such complaint had been filed.

c. The city commission on human rights and the corporation counsel shall each designate a representative authorized to receive copies of complaints in actions commenced in whole or in part pursuant to subdivision a of this section. Within 10 days after having commenced a civil action pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the plaintiff shall serve a copy of the complaint upon such authorized representatives.

d. A civil action commenced under this section must be commenced within three years after the alleged unlawful discriminatory practice or act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title occurred. Upon the filing of a complaint with the city commission on human rights or the state division of human rights and during the pendency of such complaint and any court proceeding for review of the dismissal of such complaint, such three-year limitations period shall be tolled.

e. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, where a complaint filed with the city commission on human rights or state division of human rights is dismissed for administrative convenience and such dismissal is due to the complainant's malfeasance, misfeasance or recalcitrance, the three year limitation period on commencing a civil action pursuant to this section shall not be tolled. Unwillingness to accept a reasonable proposed conciliation agreement shall not be considered malfeasance, misfeasance or recalcitrance.

f. The provisions of this section which provide a cause of action to persons claiming to be persons aggrieved by an act of discriminatory harassment or violence as set forth in chapter 6 of this title shall not apply to acts committed by members of the police department in the course of performing their official duties as police officers whether the police officer is on or off duty. This subdivision shall in no way affect rights or causes of action created by section 14-151.

g. In any civil action commenced pursuant to this section, the court, in its discretion, may award the prevailing party reasonable attorney's fees, expert fees and other costs. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term "prevailing" includes a plaintiff whose commencement of litigation has acted as a catalyst to effect policy change on the part of the defendant, regardless of whether that change has been implemented voluntarily, as a result of a settlement or as a result of a judgment in such plaintiff's favor. The court shall apply the hourly rate charged by attorneys of similar skill and experience litigating similar cases in New York county when it chooses to factor the hourly rate into the attorney's fee award.

h. 1. The term "person aggrieved" includes a person whose right created, granted or protected by chapters 1 or 6 of this title is violated by a covered entity directly or through conduct of the covered entity to which the person's agent or employee is subjected while the agent or employee was acting, or as a result of the agent or employee having acted, within the scope of the agency or employment relationship. For purposes of this subdivision, an agent or employee's protected status is imputed to that person's principal or employer when the agent or employee acts within the scope of the agency or employment relationship. It is irrelevant whether or not the covered entity knows of the agency or employment relationship.

   2. A person is aggrieved even if that person's only injury is the deprivation of a right granted or protected by chapters 1 or 6 of this title.

   3. This subdivision does not limit or exclude any other basis for a cause of action.






Chapter 6: Discriminatory Harassment Or Violence
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-602 Civil action to enjoin discriminatory harassment or violence; equitable remedies.* ::


a. Whenever a person interferes by threats, intimidation or coercion or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation or coercion with the exercise or enjoyment by any person of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, the constitution or laws of this state, or local law of the city and such interference or attempted interference is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual and reproductive health decisions, sexual orientation, age, whether children are, may or would be residing with such victim, marital status, partnership status, disability, or alienage or citizenship status as defined in chapter 1 of this title, the corporation counsel, at the request of the city commission on human rights or on the corporation counsel's own initiative, may bring a civil action on behalf of the city for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief in order to protect the peaceable exercise or enjoyment of the rights secured.

b. An action pursuant to subdivision a of this section may be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.

c. Violation of an order issued pursuant to subdivision a of this section may be punished by a proceeding for contempt brought pursuant to article 19 of the judiciary law and, in addition to any relief thereunder, a civil penalty may be imposed not exceeding $10,000 for each day that the violation continues.








*§ 8-603 Discriminatory harassment; civil penalties.* ::


a. No person shall by force or threat of force, knowingly injure, intimidate or interfere with, oppress, or threaten any other person in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to such other person by the constitution or laws of this state or by the constitution or laws of the United States or by local law of the city when such injury, intimidation, interference, oppression or threat is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual and reproductive health decisions, sexual orientation, age, marital status, partnership status, disability or alienage or citizenship status, as defined in chapter 1 of this title.

b. No person shall knowingly deface, damage or destroy the real or personal property of any person for the purpose of intimidating or interfering with the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to the other person by the constitution or laws of this state or by the constitution or laws of the United States or by local law of the city when such defacement, damage or destruction of real or personal property is motivated in whole or in part by the victim's actual or perceived race, creed, color, national origin, gender, sexual and reproductive health decisions, sexual orientation, age, marital status, partnership status, or whether children are, may be, or would be residing with such victim, disability or alienage or citizenship status, as defined in chapter 1 of this title.

c. Any person who violates subdivision a or b of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than $100,000 for each violation, which may be recovered by the corporation counsel in an action or proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction.








*§ 8-604 Disposition of civil penalties.* ::


Any civil penalties recovered by the corporation counsel pursuant to this chapter shall be paid into the general fund of the city.




Chapter 7: Discriminatory Boycotts
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 8-701 Legislative declaration.* ::


Boycotts or blacklists that are based on a person's race, color, creed, age, national origin, alienage or citizenship status, marital status, partnership status, gender, sexual orientation, or disability pose a menace to the city's foundation and institutions. In contrast to protests that are in reaction to an unlawful discriminatory practice, connected with a labor dispute or associated with other speech or activities that are protected by the first amendment discriminatory boycotts cause havoc, divide the citizenry and do not serve a legitimate purpose. The council declares that discriminatory boycotts are a dangerously insidious form of prejudice and hereby establishes a procedure for expeditiously investigating allegations of this type of prejudice, assuring that the council and mayor are duly alerted to the existence of such activity and combating discriminatory boycotts or blacklists.

   (b) Whether the commission has reason to believe a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is taking place; and

   (c) Steps the commission has taken to resolve the dispute.

(3) If it is stated within the report described in subdivision 2 of this section that the commission has reason to believe that a discriminatory boycott or blacklist has taken place, within 30 days after filing such report, the commission shall file a second report with the mayor and the council.

(4) If a finding of probable cause is not contained in the report required by subdivision 3 of this section and the boycott or blacklist continues for more than 20 days subsequent to the report's release, then, upon demand of the mayor or council, the commission shall update such report. Report updates shall detail:

   (a) Whether or not the commission presently has probable cause to believe a discriminatory boycott or blacklist is taking place; and

   (b) All new activity the commission or other city agency has taken or will undertake to resolve the dispute.

(5) If the commission determines that the disclosure of any information in a report required by this section may interfere with or compromise a pending investigation or efforts to resolve the dispute by mediation or conciliation, it shall file the report without such information and state in the report the reasons for omitting such information.
