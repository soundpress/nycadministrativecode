Section 169. ::    
        
     
        §  169.  Rules  of  tribunal.  Pursuant  to chapter forty-five of this
      charter, the tribunal shall promulgate rules of procedure,  which  shall
      include, but not be limited to, rules on the following matters:
        a.  The  types  of  representatives,  such as accountants and enrolled
      agents enrolled to practice before the internal revenue service, who may
      appear, in addition to lawyers, on behalf of  a  petitioner  before  the
      tribunal;
        b.  The  form  and  contents  of  the petition, answer, affidavits and
      memoranda  to  be  submitted  to  the  tribunal,  and  reasonable   time
      limitations for serving and filing such papers;
        c.    A  procedure  for  promptly  hearing  and determining any matter
      concerning jeopardy assessments or predecision warrants based thereon;
        d. A procedural system  guaranteeing  a  hearing  in  compliance  with
      chapter  forty-five  of this charter. Such a system shall be designed to
      assign each petition filed with the tribunal to  an  administrative  law
      judge  who  shall hear and determine all matters pertaining to questions
      of law or fact. Such a system also shall  be  designed  to  require  the
      tribunal to review en banc at the request of any party the determination
      rendered  by  an  administrative  law  judge, provided, however, that if
      there is no such request for a review within thirty days of  the  giving
      of  notice  of  such determination by the administrative law judge, such
      determination shall finally and irrevocably decide all the issues in the
      proceeding before the administrative law judge and shall be considered a
      final decision of the tribunal upon the expiration  of  such  thirty-day
      period,  except  that,  notwithstanding any other provision of law, such
      determination by the administrative law judge shall not  be  subject  to
      judicial  review.    Such  a system shall provide that the tribunal may,
      based upon the record of  the  hearing  before  the  administrative  law
      judge,  make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law and issue a
      decision either affirming, reversing or modifying the  determination  of
      the  administrative  law  judge, or the tribunal may remand the case for
      additional proceedings before the administrative law judge,  as  it  may
      deem  appropriate.  The  tribunal  in  its  discretion  may  grant  oral
      argument. Such a system shall provide that when the tribunal  reviews  a
      matter  en  banc  it must have a majority present and that not less than
      two votes shall be necessary to take any  action.  Such  a  system  also
      shall  provide  for  a  pre-hearing  conference  at  which settlement is
      encouraged;  reasonable  discovery;  and  the   submission   of   papers
      addressing both the factual and legal merits in each proceeding;
        e.  A procedural system to be followed in cases in which the matter in
      controversy is ten thousand dollars or less, exclusive of  interest  and
      penalties.  Such  a system shall be designed to provide a simplified and
      informal procedure for such small  claims  proceedings.  The  option  to
      proceed   with  a  small  claims  hearing  shall  be  exercised  by  the
      petitioner. At any time prior to  the  conclusion  of  such  hearing,  a
      petitioner  may by written notice to the tribunal discontinue such small
      claims hearing and request that the matter be transferred to  a  hearing
      conducted  before  an  administrative  law judge. Such transfer shall be
      effectuated by such written notice  and  such  discontinuance  shall  be
      without prejudice to any subsequent hearing before an administrative law
      judge.  The  determination of the presiding officer conducting the small
      claims hearing shall be conclusive upon all parties, shall be considered
      a final decision of the tribunal and shall not be subject to  review  by
      the  tribunal sitting en banc or by any court of the state. However, the
      tribunal may order a rehearing upon proof or allegation of misconduct by
      the small claims presiding officer. Determinations issued  by  presiding
      officers  shall  not  be cited, shall not be considered as precedent nor
    
      given any force or effect in any  other  proceedings  conducted  by  the
      tribunal or in any judicial proceedings conducted in this state; and
        f.  A  method  for notifying taxpayers and the commissioner of finance
      of, and for publishing, the decisions of the tribunal.
