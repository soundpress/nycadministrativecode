Section 164. ::    
        
     
        §  164.  Procedure  on  application.  a.  Between the fifteenth day of
      January and the twenty-fifth day of May, the tax commission  may  itself
      or  by a commissioner or assessor thereunto authorized by the commission
      or any other person with qualifications relevant to the review  of  real
      property  tax assessments, including real estate and real estate law, as
      determined by the commission and consistent with  state  law,  act  upon
      applications,  compel  the  attendance of witnesses, administer oaths or
      affirmations and examine applicants and other witnesses under  oath.  It
      shall  make rules of practice for proceedings before the tax commission,
      and such rules and regulations as may be appropriate  and  expedient  to
      the  end  that  the taxpayers may have a hearing in the borough in which
      they reside or in which their  property  is  located,  except  that  all
      applications  with  respect  to  property  indicated  on the tax maps by
      identification numbers shall be heard by the tax commission sitting as a
      body at its main office.
        b. The tax commission shall determine the final assesed  valuation  or
      taxable  assessed  valuation,  or  the  actual  assessment or transition
      assessment, or the proper class designation of the real property of each
      applicant. The final assessed valuation or taxable assessed valuation of
      real property may be the same as or less than  the  original  assessment
      or,  if  determined  to  be unlawful, the same shall be ordered stricken
      from the roll or where appropriate entered on the exempt portion of  the
      roll.  If  it is determined that the real property is misclassified, the
      correct class designation or allocation of assessed valuation  shall  be
      entered on the roll.
