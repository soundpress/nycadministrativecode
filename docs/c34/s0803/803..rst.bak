      investigation directed by the mayor or the council.
        b. The commissioner is authorized and empowered to make any  study  or
      investigation  which  in his opinion may be in the best interests of the
      city, including but  not  limited  to  investigations  of  the  affairs,
      functions, accounts, methods, personnel or efficiency of any agency.
        c.  1.  The  commissioner  shall,  on  an  ongoing basis, investigate,

      operations,   policies,   programs   and  practices,  including  ongoing
      partnerships with other law enforcement agencies, of the New  York  city
      police  department  with  the goal of enhancing the effectiveness of the
      department, increasing public safety,  protecting  civil  liberties  and
      civil  rights,  and  increasing  the  public's  confidence in the police
      force, thus building stronger police-community relations.
        2. Not later than ninety days after the effective date  of  the  local
      law  that  added  this subdivision, the commissioner shall report to the
      council regarding the identity  and  qualifications  of  the  individual
      responsible for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in
      paragraph  1  of  this  subdivision, the number of personnel assigned to
      assist that individual, and the  details  of  the  management  structure
      covering them. Upon removal or replacement of the individual responsible
      for overseeing the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1
      of  this  subdivision,  notification of that removal or replacement, and
      the identity and qualifications of the new  individual  responsible  for
      overseeing  the implementation of the duties described in paragraph 1 of
      this subdivision, shall be provided to the council.
        3. The Mayor, in consultation with the department  and  the  New  York
      city  police  department,  shall  have  the  discretion to determine how
      sensitive information provided to the department in connection with  any
      investigation,  review,  study,  or  audit  undertaken  pursuant to this
      section shall be treated. The Mayor shall provide the Council  with  any
      guidelines,  procedures,  protocols  or  similar measures related to the
      treatment of sensitive  information  that  he  or  she  puts  in  place.
      Sensitive  information  shall  mean  information  concerning (a) ongoing
      civil  or  criminal  investigations  or  proceedings;   (b)   undercover
      operations;   (c)   the  identity  of  confidential  sources,  including
      protected witnesses; (d) intelligence or counterintelligence matters; or
      (e) other matters the disclosure of which  would  constitute  a  serious
      threat  to  national security or to the safety of the people of the city
      of New York.
        4. The executive director of the civilian complaint review  board  and

      bureau shall report to the commissioner any  problems  and  deficiencies
      relating  to the New York city police department's operations, policies,
      programs and practices that he  or  she  has  reason  to  believe  would
      adversely affect the effectiveness of the department, public safety, the
      exercise of civil liberties and civil rights, or the public's confidence
      in  the  police  force,  and that would be relevant to the duties of the
      commissioner as described in paragraph 1 of this subdivision.
        5. No officer or employee of an agency of  the  city  shall  take  any
      adverse  personnel action with respect to another officer or employee in
      retaliation for his or her making a complaint to, disclosing information
      to,  or  responding  to  queries  from  the  commissioner  pursuant   to
      activities  undertaken  under paragraph 1 of this subdivision unless the
      complaint was made or the information was disclosed with  the  knowledge
      that  it  was  false or with willful disregard for its truth or falsity.
      Any officer or employee who believes  he  or  she  has  been  retaliated
      against for making such complaint to, disclosing such information to, or
    
      responding  to such queries from the commissioner may report such action
      to the commissioner as provided for in subdivision c of  section  12-113
      of the administrative code.
