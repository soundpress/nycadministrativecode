Section 528. ::    
        
     
        §  528. The installation and operation of security cameras in New York
      City public schools.
        a. Installation of Security Cameras. The New York City  department  of
      education,  in  consultation  with  the New York City police department,
      shall install  security  cameras  at  schools  and  consolidated  school
      locations  operated by the department of education where the chancellor,
      in consultation with the New York City  police  department,  deems  such
      cameras  appropriate  for safety purposes. Such cameras may be placed at
      the entrance and exit doors of each school and may be placed in any area
      of the school where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation  of
      privacy.  The  number,  type,  placement,  and  location of such cameras
      within each school shall be at  the  discretion  of  the  department  of
      education,  in  consultation  with  the principal of each school and the
      police department.
        b.  Schedule  of  Installation.  The  department  of   education,   in
      consultation  with  the  police department, shall set the priorities for
      installation of cameras as set forth in subdivision a to  include  among
      other  appropriate  factors  consideration  of  the level of violence in
      schools, as determined by the police department and  the  department  of
      education.  By  the  end  of 2006, the potential installation of cameras
      shall have been reviewed for all schools under the jurisdiction  of  the
      department  of  education,  including  elementary schools. At the end of
      2006, the department of education shall submit  a  report  to  the  city
      council indicating, for each school under its jurisdiction, the findings
      of the review and the reasons for the findings contained therein.
