      of this section to mandate  the  reporting  of  incidents  amounting  to
      ordinary misbehavior and "name calling" among students.
        b.  Where,  the board, a committee of the board or officer or employee
      of the city school district of the city of  New  York  has  evidence  or
      other  information  relating to a suspected crime, the board, committee,

      such  evidence  or  other  information  to the police department and the
      special commissioner of investigation, in a form and  manner  prescribed
      by  rule  by  the  police  department,  and  to  the school's principal,
      provided, however, that if such evidence or other  information  directly
      or  indirectly  involves or implicates such school principal, the report
      shall be made to the district  superintendent  as  well  as  the  police
      department.

      legal guardian of such child about whom a report has been  made,  except
      where,  after  consultation  with  the police department and the special
      commissioner of investigation, it is determined that  such  notification
      would impede a criminal investigation.
        d. Any such committee or individual who in good faith reports evidence
      or  other  information  relating  to  a  suspected  crime  to the police
      department and school principal or district superintendent in accordance
      with the provisions of subdivision b of this section shall have immunity
      from any civil liability that may arise from the making of such  report,
      and  the school district or any school district employee shall not take,
      request or cause a retaliatory action  against  any  such  committee  or
      individual who makes a report. Nothing herein shall abrogate obligations
      of  confidentiality imposed by certain privileged relationships pursuant
      to state law.
        e. The police department  shall  promulgate  all  rules  necessary  to
      implement the provisions of this section.

      members to conduct any administrative, civil or  criminal  investigation
      that  is  within  the  scope  of  their  authority,  or (2) limiting any
      obligation to file a report with  any  city,  state  or  federal  agency

        §  528. The installation and operation of security cameras in New York
      City public schools.
        a. Installation of Security Cameras. The New York City  department  of
      education,  in  consultation  with  the New York City police department,
      shall install  security  cameras  at  schools  and  consolidated  school
      locations  operated by the department of education where the chancellor,
      in consultation with the New York City  police  department,  deems  such
      cameras  appropriate  for safety purposes. Such cameras may be placed at
      the entrance and exit doors of each school and may be placed in any area
      of the school where individuals do not have a reasonable expectation  of
      privacy.  The  number,  type,  placement,  and  location of such cameras
      within each school shall be at  the  discretion  of  the  department  of
      education,  in  consultation  with  the principal of each school and the
      police department.
        b.  Schedule  of  Installation.  The  department  of   education,   in
      consultation  with  the  police department, shall set the priorities for
      installation of cameras as set forth in subdivision a to  include  among
      other  appropriate  factors  consideration  of  the level of violence in
      schools, as determined by the police department and  the  department  of
      education.  By  the  end  of 2006, the potential installation of cameras
      shall have been reviewed for all schools under the jurisdiction  of  the
      department  of  education,  including  elementary schools. At the end of
      2006, the department of education shall submit  a  report  to  the  city
      council indicating, for each school under its jurisdiction, the findings
      of the review and the reasons for the findings contained therein.
