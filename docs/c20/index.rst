Chapter 1: License Enforcement
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 20-101 Legislative intent.* ::


The council finds that for the protection and relief of the public from deceptive, unfair and unconscionable practices, for the maintenance of standards of integrity, honesty and fair dealing among persons and organizations engaging in licensed activities, for the protection of the health and safety of the people of New York city and for other purposes requisite to promoting the general welfare, licensing by the department of consumer affairs is a necessary and proper mode of regulation with respect to certain trades, businesses and industries. The council finds further that, in order to secure the above-mentioned purposes, and generally to carry out responsibilities for supervising and regulating licensed activities, trades, businesses and industries, the commissioner of consumer affairs requires powers, remedies and sanctions which are equitable, flexible and efficient. Finally, the council finds that sanctions and penalties applied by the commissioner and by the courts for the violation of laws and regulations by individuals and organizations engaging in various licensed activities, trades, businesses and industries, must be sufficient to achieve these above-mentioned purposes of licensing.

Upon a finding by the commissioner of repeated, multiple or persistent violation of any provision of this subchapter or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, the city may, except as hereinafter provided, bring an action to compel the defendant or defendants in such action to pay in court all monies, property or other things, or proceeds thereof, received as a result of such violations; to direct that the amount of money or the property or other things recovered be paid into an account established pursuant to section two thousand six hundred one of the civil practice law and rules from which shall be paid over to any and all persons who purchased the goods or services during the period of violation such sum as was paid by them in a transaction involving the prohibited acts or practices, plus any costs incurred by such claimants in making and pursuing their complaints; provided that if such claims exceed the sum recovered into the account, the awards to consumers shall be prorated according to the value of each claim proved; to direct the defendant or defendants, upon conviction, to pay to the city the costs, and disbursements of the action and pay to the city for the use of the commissioner the costs of his or her investigation leading to the judgment; or if not recovered from defendants, such costs are to be deducted by the city from the grand recovery before distribution to the consumers; and to direct that any money, property, or other things in the account and unclaimed by any persons with such claims within one year from creation of the account, be paid to the city, to be used by the commissioner for further consumer law enforcement activities.

Restitution pursuant to a judgment in an action under this subdivision shall bar, pro tanto, the recovery of any damages in any other action against the same defendant or defendants on account of the same acts or practices which were the basis for such judgment, up to the time of the judgment, by any person to whom such restitution is made. Restitution under this subdivision shall not apply to transactions entered into more than five years prior to commencement of an action by the commissioner. Before instituting an action under this subdivision, the commissioner shall give the prospective defendant written notice of the possible action, and an opportunity to demonstrate in writing within five days, that no repeated, multiple, or persistent violations have occurred.

d. Whenever any person has engaged in any acts or practices which constitute violations of any provision of this subchapter or of any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, the city may make application to the supreme court for an order enjoining such acts or practices and for an order granting a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order, or other order enjoining such acts or practices.

e. To establish a cause of action under this section it need not be shown that consumers are being or were actually injured.






*§ 20-704 Settlements.* ::


a. In lieu of instituting or continuing an action pursuant to this subchapter, the commissioner may accept written assurance of discontinuance of any act or practice in violation of this subchapter from the person or persons who have engaged in such acts or practices.

All settlements shall be made a matter of public record. If such stipulation applies to consumers who have been affected by the violator's practices but have not yet complained to the commissioner, the assurance must be approved by the court, which shall direct the minimum means by which potential claimants shall be notified of the stipulation. A consumer need not accept restitution pursuant to such a stipulation; his or her acceptance shall bar recovery of any other damages in any action by him or her against the defendant or defendants on account of the same acts or practices.

b. Violation of an assurance entered into pursuant to this section shall be treated as a violation of this subchapter and shall be subject to all the penalties provided therefor.

The submission of proof of a cure shall be deemed an admission of liability for all purposes. The option of presenting proof that the violation or violations have been cured shall be offered as part of any settlement offer made by the department to a retail store that has received a notice of violation or notices of violation for a first-time violation or first-time violations of subdivision b of this section or any rule promulgated thereunder.

**Subchapter 4: Information With Respect To Room Air Conditioners**



*§ 20-716 Legislative findings.* ::


The council hereby finds that the demand for electricity in the city has been steadily growing; that the supply of electricity has on frequent occasions been inadequate fully to meet the demand therefor; that the distribution system of the public utility company serving most of the city has frequently been disrupted by heavy loads; that major brownouts and blackouts in various sections of the city have frequently resulted from such conditions, particularly in the summer; that there is no present basis for concluding that such conditions will not continue for the foreseeable future; that fifty percent of the annual summer growth in demand for electricity in the city is due to air conditioning, that forty percent of the peak summer demand for electricity in the city is attributable to air conditioning; that room air conditioners use a significant part of the electricity used for air conditioning in the city; that the amount of electricity used by room air conditioners of comparable cooling capacity varies widely; that most sellers of room air conditioners do not presently advertise, display or otherwise provide prospective purchasers information as to the amount or cost of electricity required to operate the various models of room air conditioners; that such information, if provided, would lead consumers to purchase more efficient models; that the growth in demand for electricity in the city, particularly in summer months, would thereby be slowed and there would be an amelioration of some of the conditions which lead to brownouts and blackouts. The council also finds that an adequate supply of electricity is vital to the health, safety and welfare of all persons in the city. Accordingly, the council further finds that, in order to conserve electricity, there is a need to provide prospective purchasers of room air conditioners with information with respect to the efficiency and cost of operation of such units.

*§ 20-719 Furnishing information.* ::


Upon request, any person selling or offering for sale any room air conditioner shall furnish to anyone who inquires about such room air conditioner information as to the model number, cooling capacity rating, wattage rating and estimated yearly cost of electricity necessary to operate such room air conditioner.

For purposes of this subdivision, any paid days of rest to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 161 of the labor law shall count toward such forty hours. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to discourage or prohibit an employer from allowing the accrual of safe/sick time at a faster rate or use of sick time at an earlier date than this chapter requires.

c. An employer required to provide paid safe/sick time pursuant to this chapter who provides an employee with an amount of paid leave, including paid time off, paid vacation, paid personal days or paid days of rest required to be compensated pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 161 of the labor law, sufficient to meet the requirements of this section and who allows such paid leave to be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as safe/sick time required pursuant to this chapter, is not required to provide additional paid safe/sick time for such employee whether or not such employee chooses to use such leave for the purposes included in subdivision a of section 20-914 of this chapter.

d. 1. For an employee other than a domestic worker, safe/sick time as provided pursuant to this chapter shall begin to accrue at the commencement of employment or on the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, and an employee shall be entitled to begin using safe/sick time on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following commencement of his or her employment or on the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later. After the one hundred twentieth calendar day of employment or after the one hundred twentieth calendar day following the effective date of this local law, whichever is later, such employee may use safe/sick time as it is accrued.

   2. In addition to the paid day or days of rest to which a domestic worker is entitled pursuant to subdivision 1 of section 161 of the labor law, such domestic worker shall also be entitled to two days of paid safe/sick time as of the date that such domestic worker is entitled to such paid day or days of rest and annually thereafter, provided that notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, such two days of paid safe/sick time shall be calculated in the same manner as the paid day or days of rest are calculated pursuant to the provisions of subdivision 1 of section 161 of the labor law.

i. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued sick time that has not been used.

j. If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity or location in the city of New York, but remains employed by the same employer, such employee is entitled to all safe/sick time accrued at the prior division, entity or location and is entitled to retain or use all safe/sick time as provided pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. When there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six months of separation by the same employer, previously accrued safe/sick time that was not used shall be reinstated and such employee shall be entitled to use such accrued safe/sick time at any time after such employee is rehired, provided that no employer shall be required to reinstate such safe/sick time to the extent the employee was paid for unused accrued safe/sick time prior to separation and the employee agreed to accept such pay for such unused safe/sick time.

For sick time used pursuant to this subdivision, documentation signed by a licensed health care provider indicating the need for the amount of sick time taken shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the nature of the employee's or the employee's family member's injury, illness or condition, except as required by law.

b. Safe time.

   1. An employee shall be entitled to use safe time for absence from work due to any of the following reasons when the employee or a family member has been the victim of a family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking:

   2. For an absence of more than three consecutive work days for safe time, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the use of safe time was authorized by this subdivision. For safe time used pursuant to this subdivision, documentation signed by an employee, agent, or volunteer of a victim services organization, an attorney, a member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional service provider from whom the employee or that employee's family member has sought assistance in addressing family offense matters, sex offenses, stalking, or human trafficking and their effects; a police or court record; or a notarized letter from the employee explaining the need for such time shall be considered reasonable documentation and an employer shall not require that such documentation specify the details of the family offense matter, sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking.

c. An employer may require reasonable notice of the need to use safe/sick time. Where such need is foreseeable, an employer may require reasonable advance notice of the intention to use such safe/sick time, not to exceed seven days prior to the date such safe/sick time is to begin. Where such need is not foreseeable, an employer may require an employee to provide notice of the need for the use of safe/sick time as soon as practicable.

d. Nothing herein shall prevent an employer from requiring an employee to provide written confirmation that an employee used safe/sick time pursuant to this section.

e. An employer shall not require an employee, as a condition of taking safe/sick time, to search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which such employee is utilizing time.

An employer shall not require such employee to work additional hours to make up for the original hours for which such employee was absent or to search for or find a replacement employee to cover the hours during which the employee is absent pursuant to this section. If such employee works additional hours, and such hours are fewer than the number of hours such employee was originally scheduled to work, then such employee shall be able to use safe/sick time provided pursuant to this chapter for the difference.

   1. Except as provided in subdivision c of this section, an aggrieved fast food employee or duly authorized representative thereof or an aggrieved not-for-profit may file a complaint with the office regarding violations of this chapter by a fast food employer. Except for an allegation of retaliation in violation of section 20-1306, the office shall only investigate such a complaint if the relevant not-for-profit demonstrates that it has complied with sections 20-1303 and 20-1304 by providing a copy of the registration letter.

      (a) Deductions and remittances as authorized by the fast food employee and the payment of interest to the not-for-profit from the date of the failure to deduct or remit based on the interest rate then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the banking law, but in any event at a rate of no less than six percent per year; and

      (b) Payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $500 for each violation of this chapter. However, in cases where a final disposition has been entered against a fast food employer twice within any consecutive three-year period determining that such fast food employer has willfully failed to deduct or remit funds in accordance with this chapter, or has retaliated against a fast food employee in violation of section 20-1306, the office may impose a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding $1,000 for each violation of this chapter.

      (c) Reinstatement, back pay and other appropriate relief for any fast food employee found to have been subject to retaliation in violation of section 20-1306.

   3. In assessing an appropriate remedy, due consideration shall be given to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, and the good faith of the fast food employer. No procedure or remedy set forth in this section is exclusive of or a prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights under this chapter in a court of competent jurisdiction.

c. Failure to honor a revocation. A fast food employer or a not-for-profit that the office finds has failed to honor the revocation of a fast food employee of voluntary deductions and instead has retained contributions after revocation shall refund the fast food employee the amount of the contribution wrongfully retained. If the refund to the fast food employee is not made within 60 days of receipt of the revocation by the party that retained the contribution, the office may require the payment of interest on the amount of the refund owed based on the rate then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the banking law, but in any event at a rate of no less than six percent per year.

d. False or misleading disclosures to fast food employees. It is a violation of this chapter for a not-for-profit intentionally to make materially false or misleading disclosures to fast food employees under subdivision a of section 20-1304, and as set forth in rules prescribed by the director. Where a violation is established, such not-for-profit shall cure the false or misleading statements to fast food employees within 30 days. Upon establishing a second such violation within two years of a previous violation, the director shall revoke any previously issued letter of registration as set forth in subdivision b of section 20-1303.

a. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by a fast food employer's violation of this chapter has a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, if the relevant not-for-profit demonstrates that it has complied with sections 20-1303 and 20-1304 by providing a copy of the registration letter from the office unless such person has filed a complaint with the office with respect to such claim. If the court finds in favor of the plaintiff, it shall award such person, in addition to other relief, reasonable attorney's fees and costs.

b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of subdivision a of this section, if the office dismisses a complaint or the complaint is withdrawn, an aggrieved person maintains all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this section.

*§ 20-1309 Limitations period.* ::


The office shall not investigate violations of this chapter committed more than two years before the filing of a complaint or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier. Each failure to comply with this chapter constitutes a separate violation; a pattern of such violations is a continuing violation for purposes of assessing the limitations period.








*§ 20-1310 Application; exclusion of labor organizations.* ::

In the case of shifts that are offered with less than 24 hours’ notice to a fast food employee, the fast food employer shall wait as long as practicable under the circumstances before distributing such shifts to fast food employees from other locations or hiring or contracting for new fast food employees.

g. 1.

   1. On request, the employer must grant a request for a temporary change to the employee’s work schedule under this section two times in a calendar year for up to one business day per request. The employer may permit the employee to use two business days for one request, in which case the employer need not grant a second request.

   2. An employee who requests such a change:

      (a) Shall notify such employee’s employer or direct supervisor as soon as the employee becomes aware of the need for a temporary change to the work schedule and shall inform the employer or supervisor that the change is due to a personal event;

      (b) Shall make a proposal for the temporary change to the work schedule, unless the employee seeks leave without pay; and

      (c) Need not put the initial request in writing, but as soon as is practicable, and no later than the second business day after the employee returns to work following the conclusion of the temporary change to the work schedule, the employee must submit the request in writing, indicating the date for which the change was requested and that it was due to the employee’s personal event. The employer may require that such request be submitted in electronic form if employees of the employer commonly use such electronic form to request and manage leave and schedule changes. If the employee fails to submit the written request, the employer’s obligation to respond in writing pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subdivision is waived.

   3. An employer who receives such an initial request shall respond immediately, but need not put such initial response in writing. As soon as is practicable, and no later than 14 days after the employee submits the request in writing, the employer shall provide a written response, which may be in electronic form if such form is easily accessible to the employee. An employer’s written response shall include:

      (a) Whether the employer will agree to the temporary change to the work schedule in the manner requested by the employee, or will provide the temporary change to the work schedule as leave without pay, which does not constitute a denial;

      (b) If the employer denies the request for a temporary change to the work schedule, an explanation for the denial; and

      (c) How many requests and how many business days pursuant to this subchapter the employee has left in the calendar year after taking into account the employer’s decision contained in the written response.

   4. An employer may deny a request for a temporary change to the employee’s work schedule relating to a personal event only if the employee has already exhausted the two allotted requests in the calendar year pursuant to paragraph 1 of subdivision a of this section or if an exemption set forth in section 20-1263 applies.

b. An employee may request, and in so doing is protected by the provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter, and an employer may grant or deny, a change to a work schedule other than the temporary changes an employer is required to grant under subdivision a of this section. An employee request for such other change to a work schedule and an employer response to such a request shall follow the procedure in paragraphs 2 and 3 of subdivision a of this section to the extent applicable and as set forth in rules promulgated by the director.

c. 1. An employee need not use leave accrued under chapter 8 of this title before requesting schedule changes under this subchapter.

   2. Unpaid leave granted for a personal event pursuant to this subchapter does not count toward an employer’s obligation to grant leave under chapter 8 of this title.

   3. Leave granted under chapter 8 of this title does not count toward an employer’s obligation to grant leave under this section.

   4. Nothing in this subchapter affects an employer’s obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation in the form of a change to a work schedule required pursuant to other laws or regulations or to otherwise comply with the requirements of other laws or regulations, including, but not limited to, those requirements contained in title 8.
