        §  529.  Education  department  and  police department school incident
      reporting requirements.
        a. The New York city department of education, or its successor,  shall
      make available to the public, pursuant to subdivision d of this section,
      reports   that   reflect  the  environment  of  criminal  and  seriously
      disruptive behavior in schools operated by the department of education.
        b. Such reports shall include an  annual  reporting,  on  a  city-wide
      basis as well as for each school or co-located group of schools operated
      by  the department of education, of information reported by the New York
      city police department to the department of education on the  following:
      the  total  amount  of  major  felony  crime,  disaggregated  by  felony
      category; the total amount  of  other  crime,  disaggregated  by  crimes
      against  persons  and  crimes  against property; and the total amount of
      non-criminal incidents.
        c. Such reports shall also include an annual reporting, on a city-wide
      basis as well as for each school or co-located group of schools operated
      by  the  department  of  education,  of  incidents  designated  by   the
      chancellor  in  the  citywide  standards  of discipline and intervention
      measures (the "discipline code") as seriously disruptive,  dangerous  or
      violent  behavior in schools operated by the department of education, as
      reported in the department of education's  online  occurrence  reporting
      system, or a successor reporting system. The chancellor, in consultation
      with   the   police   department,  shall  develop  guidelines  to  avoid
      duplicative  reporting  pursuant  to  this  subdivision  of  information
      already contained in reports described in subdivision b of this section.
        d.  The  department  of education shall make such reports available on
      its web site and shall include such information  in  the  school  report
      card  for  each  school that it operates. The department shall also make
      such reports available in paper form at all schools and all district and
      regional offices, and shall provide copies to  the  public  on  request.
      Such annual reports shall be available by October 1st, and shall include
      data  from the previous school year (September 1st through June 30th) of
      information reported by the New  York  city  police  department  to  the
      department  of  education and, as soon as practicable, but no later than
      one year after the effective date of this law, shall  also  include  the
      reports   generated   by   the  department  of  education  described  in
      subdivision c of this section.
