Section 526. ::    
        
     
        §  526.    Powers  of  investigation.    The  board  of  education may
      investigate, of its own motion or otherwise either in the board or by  a
      committee  of  its  own  body, any subject of which it has cognizance or
      over which it has legal control, including the conduct  of  any  of  its
      members  or  employees  or  those of any local school board; and for the
      purpose of such investigation, such board or its president, or committee
      or its chairman, shall have and may exercise  all  the  powers  which  a
      board  of education has or may exercise in the case of a trial under the
      Education Law or the Civil Practice  Law  and  Rules.    Any  action  or
      determination  of  a  committee  appointed  under the provisions of this
      section shall be subject to approval or reversal by the board, which may
      also modify the determination of the committee in such way as the  board
      shall  deem proper and just, and the judgment of the board thereon shall
      be final.
