Section 266. ::    
        
     
        § 266. Short term debt. a. Subject to the provisions of subdivisions b
      through j of this section, the city may issue temporary debt obligations
      in  anticipation  of  taxes and revenues as authorized by state law. The
      city shall issue no short-term obligations which shall  be  inconsistent
      with  the  limitations  set  forth  in  subdivisions b through j of this
      section. The limitations on short-term borrowing imposed upon  the  city
      by  this  section  shall be in addition to the limitations on short-term
      borrowing imposed on the city under the state  local  finance  law.  The
      powers,  duties,  and  obligations  set  forth  in this section shall be
      subject to the powers, duties, and obligations placed upon any state  or
      local officer or agency, including but not limited to the New York state
      financial  control board, by or pursuant to the New York State Financial
      Emergency Act for the City of  New  York,  while  such  act  remains  in
      effect.
        b.  Revenue  or  tax  anticipation  notes  shall  be  issued against a
      specific tax or revenues receivable  which  are  clearly  identified  by
      source and fiscal year.
        c.  If  the  amount  of  taxes  or  revenues  receivable against which
      anticipation notes have been issued becomes equal to the amount of  such
      notes  outstanding,  the  city  shall deposit all further funds obtained
      from such sources into a segregated bank account which may be used  only
      to redeem such debt upon maturity.
        d.  The  city  shall  not  issue  anticipation  notes against taxes or
      revenues which have been receivable for more than two years.
        e.  No  tax  anticipation  notes  shall  be  issued  by  the  city  in
      anticipation  of  the  collection  of  taxes or assessments levied for a
      fiscal year which would cause the principal amount of such issue of  tax
      anticipation  notes  to  exceed an amount equal to ninety percent of the
      available tax levy with respect to such  issue.  For  purposes  of  this
      subdivision,  "available  tax  levy"  with  respect  to  an issue of tax
      anticipation notes means at any date of computation the total amount  of
      city  real  estate  taxes  or assessments projected, consistent with the
      financial plan then in effect, to be received in cash on or  before  the
      fifth  day  preceding  the  maturity  date of such tax anticipation note
      issue, less amounts required during  the  period  between  the  date  of
      computation  and  the  fifth day preceding such maturity date to be paid
      into a general debt service fund or otherwise required to  pay  interest
      payable  on other outstanding city bonds and notes, principal (including
      payments into sinking funds) coming due on outstanding  city  bonds  and
      principal  to  be  paid from sources other than the proceeds of bonds or
      renewal notes on other outstanding  city  notes  (exclusive  of  revenue
      anticipation  notes or renewals thereof issued less than two years prior
      to the date of computation) but  not  including  payments  from  sinking
      funds required by the terms of certain city bonds.
        f.  Tax anticipation notes and renewals thereof shall mature not later
      than the last day of the fiscal year in which they were issued.
        g. (1) No revenue anticipation note shall be issued  by  the  city  in
      anticipation  of  the  collection or receipt of revenue in a fiscal year
      which would cause the principal amount  of  revenue  anticipation  notes
      outstanding  to exceed ninety percent of the available revenues for such
      fiscal year. For purposes  of  this  subdivision,  "available  revenues"
      shall be the revenues other than real estate taxes and assessments which
      have  been  estimated in the financial plan prepared pursuant to section
      two hundred fifty eight to be realized in cash during  such  year,  less
      revenues  previously  collected,  other  than revenues on deposit in any
      special fund or account established pursuant to law for the  payment  of
      interest and/or principal of revenue anticipation notes.
    
        (2)  Each  issue of revenue anticipation notes shall be issued only in
      anticipation of the receipt of a specific type or types of  revenue  and
      the amount of revenue, the source of revenue and the anticipated date of
      payment  shall  be stated in the proceedings authorizing the issuance of
      such notes.
        (3)  Revenue  anticipation  notes shall mature not later than the last
      day of the fiscal year in which they were issued, and may not be renewed
      or extended to a date more than ten days after the anticipated  date  of
      receipt  of  such  revenue.  No such renewal note shall mature after the
      last day of such fiscal year unless the mayor  shall  certify  that  the
      revenue  against  which  such  renewal  note is issued has been properly
      accrued and estimated in the financial plan set  forth  in  section  two
      hundred  fifty-eight  in  effect on the date of issuance of such renewal
      note; provided that in no event shall  any  such  renewal  notes  mature
      later than one year subsequent to the last day of the fiscal year during
      which such revenue anticipation notes were originally issued.
        h.  (1)  No  bond anticipation note shall be issued by the city in any
      fiscal year which would cause the principal amount of bond  anticipation
      notes  outstanding, together with interest due or to become due thereon,
      to exceed fifty percent of the principal amount of bonds issued  by  the
      city  in  the twelve months immediately preceding the month in which the
      note is to be issued.
        (2) The proceeds of each bond issued shall be (i) held  in  trust  for
      the  payment,  at maturity, of the principal of and interest on any bond
      anticipation notes of the city issued in anticipation of such bonds  and
      outstanding  at  the  time of the issuance of such bonds, (ii) paid into
      the general fund of the city in repayment of any advance made from  such
      fund  pursuant  to  section  165.10  of the state local finance law, and
      (iii) any balance shall be expended for the object or purpose for  which
      such bonds were issued.
        (3) Bond anticipation notes shall mature not later than one year after
      their date of issuance and may be renewed for a period not to exceed two
      years,  or  such longer period as may be permitted for bond anticipation
      notes of the state, from the date of original issue.
        i. Budget notes issued pursuant to section 29.00 of  the  state  local
      finance  law  may  only  be  issued  to  fund  projected  expense budget
      deficits. No budget notes or renewals thereof shall  mature  later  than
      sixty  days prior to the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding the
      fiscal year during which such budget notes were originally issued.
        j. All references to the state local finance law in this section shall
      be deemed to refer to the provisions of the New York state local finance
      law as such provisions  may  be  amended  over  time  or  any  successor
      provisions thereto.
