Section 276. ::    
        
     
        §  276. Annual appropriations to the sinking funds. For the redemption
      of the corporate stock redeemable from the several sinking funds of  the
      city  established prior to July first, nineteen hundred eighty-one there
      shall be included annually in the budget and  paid  into  each  of  such
      sinking   funds   an  amount  to  be  estimated  and  certified  by  the
      comptroller, which amount shall be not less than the aggregate  of  such
      annual  contributions, as calculated at the time each issue of corporate
      stock redeemable from such sinking fund was made, would be sufficient if
      thereafter  annually  contributed  to  such  fund  together   with   the
      accumulations  of  interest  thereon  computed  at  the rate of four per
      centum per annum to meet and discharge such outstanding corporate  stock
      when  the same shall be payable; provided, however, that if at the close
      of a fiscal year there is in any sinking fund a surplus over  and  above
      the  reserve  required  by  such  sinking  fund  computed as hereinabove
      provided, the comptroller, in estimating the amount to be  included  for
      such  sinking  fund in the budget, shall reduce the amount of the annual
      contributions by the amount of such surplus.
        Amounts received annually from the  operation  of  any  rapid  transit
      railroad  for  the  construction,  equipment  or  acquisition  of  which
      corporate stock redeemable from any such fund shall  have  been  issued,
      shall not be considered or treated as surplus, but such amounts shall be
      deducted from the amount certified by the comptroller for the budget for
      the ensuing year.
