The board of trustees shall retire any member who, upon an examination, as provided in subdivision d of this section, may be found to be disqualified, physically or mentally, for the performance of his or her duties. Such member so retired shall receive from such pension fund an annual pension as provided in this section. In every case such board shall determine the circumstances thereof, and such pension so allowed is to be in lieu of any salary received by such member at the time of his or her being so retired. The department shall not be liable for the payment of any claim or demand for services thereafter rendered, and the amount of such pension shall be determined upon the following conditions:

   1. In case of total permanent disability at any time caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, the amount of annual pension to be allowed shall be not less than three-fourths of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement.

   1-a. In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision a, a pension equal to but not exceeding three-fourths of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement, such member shall receive, in addition, the amount of the deductions, without interest, made from his or her pay, salary or compensation pursuant to subdivision nine of section 13-203 of this subchapter, such amount to be paid either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of such amount of deductions, as the member may elect.

   2. In case of partial permanent disability at any time caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which disqualifies him or her only from performing active duty in the police force, the member so disabled shall be relieved by the commissioner from active service and assigned to the performance of such light duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify him or her to be qualified to perform, or he or she shall be retired on his or her own application at not less than three-fourths of his or her salary at the date of his or her retirement from the service, on an examination, as provided by subdivision d of this section, showing that his or her disability is permanent.

   2-a. In any case where a member is allowed, pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision a, a pension equal to but not exceeding threefourths of his or her salary at the date of his or her retirement from the service, such member shall receive, in addition, the amount of the deductions, without interest, made from his or her pay, salary or compensation pursuant to subdivision nine of section 13-203 of this subchapter, such amount to be paid either in a lump sum or in the form of an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of such amount of deductions, as the member may elect. Such annuity, if so elected, shall be computed on the basis of the mortality tables adopted pursuant to section 13-221 of this chapter, as in effect on the date of retirement of such member, and on the basis of regular interest.

   3. In case of total permanent disability not caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which shall occur after the expiration of ten years' service in such department, but before he or she has performed service in the force for a period greater than the minimum period for service retirement elected by him or her, the amount of annual pension to be allowed shall be one-half of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.

   4. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which may occur after ten years' service in such department, the member so disabled may be relieved by the commissioner from active service, but shall remain a member of the police force, subject to the rules governing such force, and be assigned to the performance of such light duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify him or her to be qualified to perform, or, if such member be retired after the expiration of ten years' service, but before he or she has performed service in the force for a period greater than the minimum period for service retirement elected by him or her, the annual pension to be paid to such member shall be one-half of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.

   5. In case of total permanent disability not caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which may occur before the expiration of ten years' service in such department, the amount of annual pension to be allowed shall be one-third of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.

   6. In case of partial permanent disability not caused in or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, which may occur before ten years' service in such department, the member so disabled shall be relieved by the commissioner from active service, but shall remain a member of the police force, subject to the rules governing such force, and be assigned to the performance of such light duties as a police surgeon of such department may certify him or her to be qualified to perform, or, if such member be retired before the expiration of ten years' service, the annual pension to be paid to such member shall be one-third of the annual salary of such member at the date of his or her retirement from the service.

b. Any member of such department, who has or shall have performed duty therein for a period of twenty years or upwards, upon a medical examination, as provided in subdivision d of this section, showing that such member is permanently disabled, physically or mentally, so as to be unfit for duty, shall be retired from such force and service, and placed on the roll of the pension fund, and awarded and granted, to be paid from such fund:

   1. an annual pension during his or her lifetime, of a sum not less than one-half his or her full salary at the date of his or her retirement from the service; and

   2. if such member is awarded and granted, pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision b, an annual pension equal to but not exceeding one-half of his or her full salary at the date of his or her retirement from the service, and if such member, at the time of such retirement, has performed service in the force for a number of years greater than the minimum period for service retirement elected by him or her, an annual pension, in addition to the pension provided for by paragraph one of this subdivision b, which shall be equal to:

      (i) one-fortieth of his or her full salary or compensation on the date of his or her retirement from the service, multiplied by the number of years of service in the force performed by him or her after completion of such minimum period of service elected by him or her, if such member elected a minimum period of twenty years; or

      (ii) one-fiftieth of his or her full salary or compensation on the date of his or her retirement from the service, multiplied by the number of years of service in the force performed by him or her after completion of such minimum period of service elected by him or her, if such member elected a minimum period of twenty-five years.

c. Any member who:

   1. Shall have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty years of service and who has or shall have performed service in the force for at least twenty years, or

   2. Shall have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty-five years of service and who has or shall have performed service in the force for at least twenty-five years, upon his or her own application in writing to and filed with the board setting forth at what time, not less than thirty days subsequent to the execution and filing thereof, he or she desires to be retired, shall be retired as of the date specified in said application from such force and service, and placed on the roll of the pension fund, and awarded and granted, to be paid from such fund, an annual pension during his or her lifetime, not less than one-half of his or her full salary at the date of his or her retirement from service, and provided further that at the time so specified for his or her retirement his or her term or tenure of office or employment shall not have terminated or have been forfeited, provided further that upon his or her request in writing the member shall be granted a leave of absence from the date of filing said application until the date the retirement becomes effective.

d. All medical examinations required by or made pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall be conducted by a medical board appointed by the commissioner, provided, however, that any member, within thirty days after receipt of the decision of such medical board, in writing may request that the decision of such board be reviewed by a special medical board which shall consist of one doctor of the medical board and a doctor selected and compensated by such member. The decision of such special board shall supersede the decision of the medical board. In the event that the two doctors of the special board shall disagree, a recognized specialist on the condition, disease or injury for which such member has been examined or for which disability is claimed shall be selected by such doctors to be a third member of the special board. The decision of a majority of the three members of such special board shall supersede the decision of the medical board. The specialist selected by the two doctors of the special board shall be compensated by the city. Such compensation shall be fixed by the comptroller and shall be subject to his or her audit.

e. The board of trustees shall have the power to grant, award or pay a pension on account of physical or mental disability or disease, only upon a certificate of a medical board or a special medical board after examination as provided in subdivision d of this section. Such certificate shall set forth the cause, nature and extent of the disability, disease or injury of such member.

f. (1) In any case where a person who retired for service as a member of the pension fund is subsequently appointed police commissioner or a deputy police commissioner, his or her pension shall cease. During his or her service as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner he or she shall again be a member of the pension fund and shall contribute thereto at the rate of contribution applicable to him or her at the time of his or her prior retirement.

   (2) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs three and four of this subdivision f, upon his or her subsequent retirement as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner, as the case may be, he or she shall receive the pension, if any, which he or she was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to his or her appointment as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner, and in addition, a further pension of one-sixtieth of his or her average annual salary earned during his or her credited service after restoration to membership pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision f, multiplied by the number of years of his or her credited service during such restoration.

   (3) Subject to the provisions of paragraph four of this subdivision f, where any such retiree who is appointed police commissioner or deputy police commissioner shall have earned at least three years of member credit for service during the period of his or her restoration to membership pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision f, the total service credit to which he or she was entitled at the time of his or her earlier retirement may, at his or her election, again be credited to him or her and upon his or her subsequent retirement as police commissioner or deputy police commissioner, as the case may be, he or she shall be credited in addition with all service during such period of restoration to membership.

   (4) Such total service credit to which he or she was entitled at the time of his or her earlier retirement shall be credited as provided in paragraph three of this subdivision f only in the event that he or she returns to the pension fund with regular interest the actuarial equivalent of the amount of the amount of the pension he or she received; provided, however, that in the event that such amount is not so repaid, the actuarial equivalent thereof shall be deducted from his or her subsequent pension.

g. The granting of a pension on severance from service for fault or delinquency shall not be a matter of right, but such a pension may be granted in consideration of special circumstances by the board of trustees and a vote of at least two-thirds of the whole number of votes authorized to be cast by all the members of such board.

h. The terms "total permanent disability" and "partial permanent disability" as used in this section may be defined in the rules and regulations of the board of trustees.

i. Except as otherwise provided, the pensions granted under this section shall be for the life of the pensioner, and shall not be revoked, repealed or diminished.

*§ 13-207 [Minimum disability pension.]* ::


a. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13-206 of this subchapter, in any case where a pension was or is awarded under the provisions of such section, by reason of the retirement of a member for disability caused or induced by the actual performance of the duties of his or her position, such member shall be entitled to a pension of not less than three-fourths the annual salary or compensation payable to a first grade patrolman as of July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five. In the case of any member receiving a pension less than three-fourths the annual salary or compensation of a first grade patrolman as of July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five his or her pension shall be increased by such amount which when added to the lesser pension shall equal three-fourths the annual salary or compensation of a first grade patrolman as of July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five.

b. Such pension shall be payable to the same persons and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions as to termination as to the pension which would otherwise be payable under section 13-206 of this subchapter.

Except as provided in subdivisions a and b of section 13-206 of this subchapter:

1. A member who shall have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty years of service, upon completing such period of service, may continue in the service. In such event and upon retirement for service, there shall be added to his or her annual service pension one-sixtieth of the salary received at the date of retirement for each completed additional year of service, during which years such deductions shall have been made. Any such member upon completing twenty-five years of service, shall have such deductions made at the rate of five per cent, in which event and upon retirement for service, such additional amounts also shall be added to his or her annual service pension for the years during which deductions shall have been made at the rate of five per cent.

2. A member who shall have elected to contribute on the basis of retirement after twenty-five years of service, upon completing such period of service, may continue in the service. In such event there shall be added to his or her annual service pension upon retirement for service one-sixtieth of the salary received at the date of retirement for each completed additional year of service, during which years such deductions shall have been made at the rate of five per cent.






*§ 13-209 Payment of pensions; death.* ::


a. The board of trustees of the pension fund shall pay a pension out of such fund to the spouse, child or children or dependent parent or parents of any deceased member of the police force in such department, if the death of such member occur during his or her service in such police force, or after he or she was retired from service in such force. The amount of any such pension to be paid by the board of trustees to each of the several representatives of such member, in case there shall be more than one, from time to time, may be determined by such board according to the circumstances of each case. The annual pension to the representative or representatives of such member, however, shall be six hundred dollars, and no part of such sum shall be paid to any such spouse who shall remarry, after such remarriage, or to any child after it shall have reached the age of eighteen years. In lieu of the aforementioned pension, when a member of the force dies while in active service, his or her beneficiary shall be paid the accumulated deductions of such deceased member if written application therefor be made to the board of trustees by such beneficiary.

b. In case any member in the police force of such department is killed while actually engaged in the performance of duty, or if death ensues, or results from a disease, as the immediate effect of injuries received, the board of trustees of such fund, upon evidence submitted to it, shall have power to decide whether death so occurred and upon such decision shall award to the spouse of such member an annual sum as a pension, to be paid out of such fund in an amount not to exceed, except as herein provided, one-half of the salary of such member at the date of his or her decease. If such member, dying, leaves no spouse surviving him or her, but leaves a child or children, under the age of eighteen years, or dependent parent or parents, such board shall award to the legal guardian of such child or children, or dependent parent or parents, for its or their support and maintenance, an annual sum as a pension out of such fund, in an amount not to exceed one-half of the salary of such member at the date of his or her decease. The amount of such pension to any spouse shall cease upon his or her death. Such annual pension shall cease upon the death or marriage of such child, or upon its reaching the age of eighteen years. If such payment to the spouse of any such member shall cease by reason of his or her death, such board shall make payments to the child or children, or dependent parent or parents of such member, if any, as though he or she had died without leaving a spouse surviving him or her.

c. The board of trustees, subject to the separate approval of the mayor, may presume a member or former member of the pension fund to be dead, if such member has disappeared and has been absent for three years or more, unless there be affirmative evidence that he or she was alive within that time. In the case of a former member who has disappeared, has been absent for three years or more and who was last known to be alive while a member of the police force in the department, the board of trustees, subject to the separate approval of the mayor, may presume that death occurred while such former member was a member of such police force, unless there be affirmative evidence that he or she was alive after his or her separation from service in the police force. If in its judgment the evidence warrants such determination, the board of trustees, subject to the separate approval of the mayor, may make an additional and separate finding that such presumed death occurred while such member or former member was actually engaged in the performance of duty. In the event that the board of trustees, upon approval of the mayor, shall take action pursuant to a presumption of death with respect to the disappearance of a former member of the police force, the police commissioner shall have power to revoke any disciplinary action, with respect to the absence of such former member of the police force, which was taken by him or her after the date when such former member is presumed to have died. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the board of trustees and the police commissioner shall have power to revoke or rescind any action taken by them, respectively, pursuant to this subdivision, with or without cause at any time prior to five years from the date of the disappearance of a member or former member and thereafter they may take action and exercise such power in the event that they respectively shall determine, on the basis of affirmative evidence submitted to them, that any member or former member was alive after the date he or she was presumed to be dead. Upon the expiration of a period of five years from the date of the disappearance of a member or former member, continuation of the payment of a pension pursuant to this section based upon the presumed death of such member or former member shall be conditioned upon a determination by a court of competent jurisdiction, in an action or special proceeding brought by a beneficiary receiving all or part of such pension or any other member of the family of such member or former member pursuant to the provisions of section 21.7 of the estates, powers and trusts law, that such member or former member is presumed to be dead. Such determination shall be deemed conclusive for the purposes of this section, unless such member or former member thereafter shall be found to be alive.

d. (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b of this section, in any case where a pension was or is awarded under the provisions of such subdivision, or any predecessor provision by reason of the death of any such member, occurring before July first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five, such pension, subject to the provisions of paragraphs two and three of this subdivision d, shall consist:

      (b) For any portion of a calendar year, on and after January first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five, the appropriate pro rata portion of the amount which would be payable, under the provisions of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph one, for the full calendar year which includes such portion of a year, if a pension were payable under this subdivision d for such full calendar year.

   (3) The pension payable pursuant to the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision d shall be in lieu of any pension which would otherwise be payable on or after January first, nineteen hundred and sixty-five pursuant to the provisions of such subdivision b, or predecessor provision, and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph one of subdivision e of section 13-686 of this title, shall be in lieu of any supplemental retirement allowance which would otherwise be payable, on and after such date, under the provisions of subchapter six of chapter five of this title or any other law.

            (3) Except for a change of selection of mode of benefit prohibited by sub-item two of this item (B), any original selection of mode of benefit may be changed pursuant to this item (B) to another selection of mode of benefit, provided all of the conditions set forth in sub-items four, six and eight of this item (B) are met.

            (7) Upon the filing of a new selection of mode of benefit pursuant to this item (B) by any such person entitled to a recomputation, such new selection shall be irrevocable and such person shall not be entitled to file any other selection of mode of benefit with respect to such retirement allowance (or any component thereof) which became payable to him or her prior to the date of enactment of this paragraph (g).

      (b) In any case where, by reason of credit for such immediately preceding service, the date of completion of such member's minimum period for service retirement under the police pension fund became or becomes earlier than such date would have been or would be if such credit for immediately preceding service had not been so acquired, there shall be effected with respect to such member:

         (i) such increase in such member's normal rate of contribution, effective as of the date on which such member last became a member of the police pension fund, as may be necessary to reflect such earlier date of eligibility for service retirement; and

         (ii) the charging of such member who acquired or acquires such credit for such immediately preceding service with a contribution rate deficiency:

            (A) which shall accrue from the date on which such member last became a member of the police pension fund; and

            (B) which shall be in such amount as shall be the product of the increase provided in item (i) of this subparagraph (b) and the member's compensation during the period of time provided in sub-item (A) of this item (ii); and

            (C) which, unless paid by such member in such manner as shall be prescribed by rules and regulations adopted by the board of trustees of such pension fund, shall require an appropriate adjustment of any benefit which may become payable to or on account of such member.

   (3) Nothing contained in subparagraph (b) of paragraph two of this subdivision d shall cause a member who acquires or acquired service credit by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (a) of such paragraph two to be denied:

      (a) the right or entitlement, if any, to terminate or reduce contributions to such pension fund or to a refund of or credit for contributions paid during a period when the member would have been entitled to terminate or reduce such contributions if he or she had such service credit on the date when he or she last became a member of the pension fund; or

      (b) any other right, benefit or entitlement of a similarly situated member of such pension fund with equal total service credit consisting only of service in the uniformed force of the police department, provided that the foregoing provisions of this paragraph three shall not be construed in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of subparagraph (b) of paragraph two of this subdivision d.

e. Any person who was a member of the board of education retirement system and whose membership therein was terminated by such member attaining membership in the police pension fund, subchapter two, shall receive credit in the said police pension fund for prior creditable city service by paying into the annuity savings fund of the said police pension fund the amount of the employee contributions required to have been paid into the board of education retirement system for such prior creditable city service, within one year after July sixteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-five shall take effect, or within one year after becoming a member of the police pension fund, subchapter two, whichever is later, and shall have the period of such prior creditable city service counted as service as a police officer for the purpose only of determining the amount of such member's pension or retirement allowance, provided however, that no member of the said police pension fund shall be eligible for retirement for service until he or she has served in the police force for a minimum period of twenty or twenty-five years, or until he or she has reached the age of fifty-five, according to the minimum period or age of retirement elected by such member prior to the certification of his or her rate of contribution.

f. (1) Upon election, any member of the police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, who was a member of the New York city employees' retirement system while employed as a New York city police department trainee shall receive credit in the said police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, for prior creditable service in the New York city employees' retirement system earned while employed as a New York city police department police trainee by paying into the annuity savings fund of said police pension fund additional member contributions plus interest which would have been paid or credited had such member been a member of the police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, from his or her last date of appointment as a New York city police department trainee or date of membership in the New York city employees' retirement system, whichever is later, provided such payment is made within one year after this subdivision shall take effect, and the period of such prior service credit shall be deemed to be service in the police force for purposes of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amounts of benefits under the police pension fund.

   (2) A member of the police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, who acquires service credit by reason of the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision shall be entitled to any other right, benefit or entitlement of a similarly situated member of such pension fund with equal total service credit consisting only of service in the uniformed force of the police department.

Beame, 570 F.2d 57) shall receive credit in the police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, for the period of such retroactive eligibility by paying into the annuity savings fund of said police pension fund additional member contributions plus interest which would have been paid or credited had such member been a member of the police pension fund from the retroactive appointment eligibility date as a New York city police department trainee, provided such payment is made within one year after this subdivision takes effect:

      (b) The period of such retroactivity shall be deemed to be service in the police force for purposes of eligibility for benefits and to determine the amounts of benefits under the police pension fund.

   (2) A member of the police pension fund, subchapter two of this chapter, who acquires service credit by reason of the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision shall be entitled to any other right, benefit or entitlement of a similarly situated member of such pension fund with equal total service credit consisting only of service in the uniformed force of the police department.

h.*   (1) Any member of the pension fund who, prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-two, would have been entitled to transfer membership in another public retirement system to the pension fund pursuant to any provision of law, but who failed to make a timely election to do so, may elect to transfer such membership to the pension fund by filing a written request for such transfer with the first retirement system within one year after the effective date of this subdivision.

* Editor's note: there are two divisions designated h in this section; see 2000 N.Y. Laws chs. 571 and 594.

   (2) All transfers of membership to the pension fund pursuant to this subdivision shall be in accordance with the procedures set forth in the transfer provisions that would have been applicable if the member had made a timely election to transfer. Where a transfer is made pursuant to this subdivision, and such applicable transfer provisions would have required a transfer of pension reserves, the first retirement system shall transfer to the pension fund all pension reserves that would have been transferred to the pension fund if the member had made a timely election to transfer.

   (3) Service credit transferred to the pension fund pursuant to this subdivision shall be credit in the same manner and for the same purposes as it would have been credited if the member had made a timely election to transfer, and the member shall pay to the pension fund all member contributions, plus interest, which would have been paid or credited if such service credit had been transferred to the pension fund on the date of such member's entry into the pension fund.

h.*   Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision c of this section, any member who is absent without pay for child care leve of absence pursuant to regulations of the New York city police department shall be eligible for credit for such period of child care leave provided such member files a claim for such service credit with the pension fund by December thirty-first, two thousand one or within ninety days following termination of the child care leave, whichever is later, and contributes to the pension fund an amount which such member would have contributed during the period of such child care leave, together with interest thereon. Service credit provided pursuant to this subdivision shall not exceed one year of credit for each period of authorized child care leave. In the event there is a conflict between the provisions of this subdivision and the provisions of any other law or code to the contrary, the provisions of this subdivision shall govern.

* Editor's note: there are two divisions designated h in this section; see 2000 N.Y. Laws chs. 571 and 594.






*§ 13-219 Re-entry into membership after withdrawal of contributions.* ::


If a member has received benefits under section 13-240 of this subchapter, his or her member-service credit at the time of leaving service shall be restored in full provided such member returns to service within five years after leaving service and redeposits the total amount so withdrawn. Subsequent contributions shall be at the rate applicable to his age on re-entry to service.






*§ 13-220 Pension fund; a corporation.* ::


The pension fund shall have the powers and privileges of a corporation and by its name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, all warrants for money drawn and payments made, and all of its cash and securities and other property held.






*§ 13-221 Pension fund; adoption of tables and certification of rates.* ::


The actuary appointed by the board of estimate shall be the technical adviser of the board on all matters regarding the operation of the funds provided for by this subchapter and shall perform such other duties as are required of him or her. He or she shall keep in convenient form such data as shall be necessary for the actuarial valuation of such funds. Every five years, he or she shall make an actuarial investigation into the mortality, service and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries as defined by this subchapter and he or she shall make a valuation, as of June thirtieth of each year, of the assets and liabilities of the various funds provided for by this subchapter at such times as he or she shall determine. Upon the basis of such investigation such board shall:

1. Adopt for the pension fund such mortality, service and other tables as shall be deemed necessary; and

2. Certify the rates of deduction from compensation computed to be necessary to pay the annuities authorized under the provisions of this subchapter.






*§ 13-222 Pension fund; reports.* ::


Such board shall publish annually in the City Record a report for the preceding year showing a valuation of the assets and liabilities of the funds provided for by this subchapter as certified by the actuary, and a statement as to the accumulated cash and securities of the funds as certified by the comptroller, and shall set forth in such report such other facts, recommendations and data as may be of value in the advancement of knowledge concerning employees' pensions and annuities.






*§ 13-223 Medical board.* ::


a. (1) There shall be a medical board of three physicians. One of such physicians shall be appointed by the board and shall hold office at the pleasure of such board, one shall be appointed by the commissioner of health and shall hold office at the pleasure of such commissioner, and the third shall be appointed by the commissioner of citywide administrative services and shall hold office at the pleasure of such commissioner.

   (2) The board, the commissioner of health and the commissioner of citywide administrative services shall each have power to appoint one or more but not exceeding four alternate physicians, who shall hold office at the pleasure of such appointing board or official. Whenever the board of trustees of the retirement system shall so direct, the functions, powers and duties of the medical board, in addition to being performed and exercised by the three physicians appointed pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, shall be performed and exercised by one or more groups of three physicians as hereinafter prescribed. Each such group of three physicians shall function separately as the medical board and each such group may consist partly of a physician or physicians appointed pursuant to such paragraph one and partly of one or more alternate physicians or may consist entirely of alternate physicians; provided, however, that one of the physicians or alternate physicians in each such group shall be appointed by the board, one by the commissioner of health and one by the commissioner of citywide administrative services.

b. The medical board shall arrange for and shall pass upon all medical examinations required under the provisions of this subchapter, shall investigate all essential statements and certifications by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for disability retirement, and shall report to the board its conclusions and recommendations thereon.






*§ 13-224 The funds; component funds.* ::


The funds provided for herein are the annuity savings fund, the annuity reserve fund, the dependent benefit contingent reserve fund, the dependent benefit reserve fund, the contingent reserve fund and the pension reserve fund.






*§ 13-225 Contributions of members and their use; annuity savings fund.* ::


a. (1) The annuity savings fund shall be the fund in which there shall be accumulated deductions from the compensation of members to provide for their annuities and their withdrawal allowances. Upon the basis of the tables herein authorized, and regular interest, the actuary of such board shall determine for each member the proportion of compensation which, when deducted from each payment of his or her prospective earnable compensation prior to his or her eligibility for retirement and accumulated at regular interest until the attainment of the minimum age or period of service retirement elected by him or her, shall be computed to provide, at that time, an annuity equal to twenty-five seventy-fifths of the pension then allowable to him or her for service as a member. Such proportion of compensation shall be computed to remain constant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rate of contribution required to be made on and after October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, by any member whose rate was computed pursuant to this subdivision, as enacted by local law two of nineteen hundred forty, shall be twenty-five forty-fifths of such prior rate.

   (2) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of paragraph (one) of this subdivision a, the rate of contribution required to be made on and after the first day of the first payroll period beginning after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight by any member who became a member after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred forty-seven and prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven shall be his or her rate as of June twenty-ninth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, as computed pursuant to paragraph (one) of this subdivision a, including any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section or any decrease thereof pursuant to section 13-226 of this subchapter or subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, hereinafter referred to as his or her "computed prior rate", less the difference between the rate which was computed for such member on the date he or she last became a member pursuant to paragraph (one) of the subdivision a, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section or any decrease thereof pursuant to paragraph (one) of this subdivision or section 13-226 of this subchapter or pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, and the rate which would have been computed for such member on the date he or she last became a member, pursuant to paragraph (one) of this subdivision, had he or she been entitled on that date to regular interest at four per cent; provided that the adjusted rate of contribution computed pursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to change pursuant to subdivisions c and d of this section, section 13-226 of this subchapter or pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law.

   (3) for any member to whom the last paragraph applies, and beginning with the first day of the first payroll period commencing after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and ending with the last day of the last payroll period before the first payroll period beginning after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the amount of contribution paid by him or her which represents the difference between the "computed prior rate" of such member and his or her adjusted rate of contribution as computed pursuant to paragraph (two) of this subdivision a shall be refunded upon the member's election, or, otherwise, shall be deemed additional contributions for the purpose of purchasing additional annuity, but such additional contributions shall not enter into the computation for allowance on ordinary disability retirement as described in section 13-251 of this subchapter.

b. Such board shall certify to the commissioner who shall deduct from the compensation of each member on each and every pay roll of such member for each and every pay roll period, the proportion of his or her earnable compensation so computed. Such board shall not certify nor shall the commissioner make any deduction for annuity purposes from the compensation of a member who elects not to contribute if his or her age and total service are such as would entitle a new entrant to retire for service on a pension not less than seventy-five per cent of one-half of his or her final compensation. In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, such board may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period and such board may omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if an employee was not a member on the first day of the payroll period. To facilitate the making of deductions, such board may modify the deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of one per cent of the compensation upon the basis of which such deduction is to be made. The deductions provided herein shall be made notwithstanding that the minimum compensation provided by law for any member shall be reduced thereby. Every member shall be deemed to consent and agree to the deductions made and provided for herein and shall receipt in full for his or her salary or compensation, and payment less such deductions shall be a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands whatsoever for the services rendered by such person during the period covered by such payment, except his or her claim to the benefits to which he or she may be entitled under the provisions of this subchapter. The commissioner shall certify to the comptroller on each and every payroll the amounts to be deducted. Each of such amounts shall be deducted and when deducted shall be paid into the annuity savings fund, and shall be credited, together with regular interest, to an individual account of the member from whose compensation such deduction was made. The method of computation and deductions prescribed by this subdivision and subdivision a of this section shall be appropriately modified in the case of a member for whom a rate is otherwise fixed pursuant to section 13-226 of this subchapter.

c. In addition to the computed deductions, any member may elect to contribute at a rate fifty per centum in excess of that heretofore provided, for the purpose of purchasing additional annuity. In computing the amount of such additional rate any modification of the normal rate pursuant to section 13-226 of this subchapter shall be disregarded. These additional contributions shall be credited to the annuity savings fund with regular interest. Such additional contributions shall not enter into the computation for allowance on ordinary disability retirement as described in section 13-251 of this subchapter. A member may elect to discontinue his or her additional contributions at any time.

d. In addition to the deductions from compensation hereinbefore provided, any member may redeposit in the annuity savings fund by a single payment an amount equal to the total amount which he or she withdrew previously therefrom as provided in this subchapter, or any member may deposit therein by a single payment, or in equal installments over a period to be designated by such member, but not exceeding five years, immediately prior to his or her retirement, an amount computed to be sufficient to purchase an additional annuity, which, together with his or her prospective retirement allowance, will provide for him or her a total retirement allowance of one-half of his or her final compensation at the minimum age or period of retirement elected by him or her. Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of his or her accumulated deductions. The accumulated deductions of a member withdrawn as provided in this subchapter shall be paid out of the annuity savings fund. Upon retirement of a member, his or her accumulated deductions shall be transferred from such fund to the annuity reserve fund.

e. In the case of a member receiving extra pay, salary or compensation for additional duties assigned to him or her, the comptroller shall make such semi-monthly deductions on the basis of such extra pay, salary or compensation unless such member shall signify in writing to the board, within thirty days after the first receipt thereof, his or her election to have his or her benefits and obligations computed on the basis of the pay, salary or compensation received by him or her prior to the time when he or she first received such extra compensation. If any member receives extra pay, salary or compensation for an aggregate or five years or more or for the period of time fixed by section 14-114 of this code, the comptroller shall continue to make such semi-monthly deductions on the basis of such extra pay, salary or compensation, notwithstanding that such member does not continue to receive it, unless such member shall signify to the board in writing his or her election to have his or her benefits and obligations computed on the basis of the pay, salary or compensation actually received by him. Additional deductions so made shall entitle such member to a retirement allowance on the basis of such extra pay, salary or compensation. The provisions of this subdivision shall not diminish or impair the benefits provided in subdivision c of section 14-114 of this code.






*§ 13-225.1 Employer pick up of member contributions.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, on and after the starting date for pick up, the city shall pick up and pay into the annuity savings fund, the member contributions eligible for pick up by the employer which each member would otherwise be required to make on and after such starting date.

b. An amount equal to the amount of such picked up contributions shall be deducted by the city from the compensation of such member (as such compensation would be in the absence of a pick up program applicable to him or her hereunder) and shall not be paid to such member. Such deduction shall be effected by means of subtraction from such member's current compensation (as so defined), or offset against future pay increases, or a combination of such methods.

c. (1) The member contributions picked up pursuant to this section for any member shall be paid by the city in lieu of an equal amount of the member contributions otherwise required to be paid by such member under the provisions of this subchapter, including any member contributions required to be made for the purchase of credit for previous service or credit for military service pursuant to subdivision f of this section, provided, however, that contributions picked up for the purchase of credit for military service shall be deposited in the employer contributions account in accordance with the provisions of subdivision four of section one thousand of the retirement and social security law and shall be deemed to be and treated as employer contributions pursuant to subsection h of section four hundred fourteen of the United States internal revenue code, as amended, for the purposes, under federal law, for which such subsection h so classifies such picked up contributions. Subject to the provisions of subdivision b of this section, for all other purposes, including, but not limited to:

      (i) the obligation of such member to pay New York state and New York city income and/or wages or earnings taxes and the withholding of such taxes; and

      (ii) the determination of the amount of such member's member contributions eligible for pick up by the employer; and

      (iii) the determination of the amount of any retirement allowance or other pension fund benefit payable to or on account of such member or any other pension fund right, benefit or privilege of such member; the amount of the member contributions picked up pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be a part of the employee compensation of such member, and such member's gross compensation (as it would be in the absence of a pick up program applicable to him or her hereunder) shall not be deemed to be changed by such member's particiaption* in such program.

   (2) Nothing contained in paragraph one of this subdivision c shall be construed as superseding the provisions of section four hundred thirty-one of the retirement and social security law or any similar provision of law which limits the salary base for computing retirement benefits payable by a public retirement system.

d. (1) For the purpose of determining the pension fund rights, benefits and privileges (including the procurement of loans) of any member whose member contributions eligible for pick up by the employer are picked up pursuant to this section, such picked up member contributions shall be deemed to be and treated as member contributions made by such member pursuant to law and as included in such member's accumulated deductions. Interest on such picked up contributions shall accrue in favor of the member and be payable by the city at the same rate, for the same time periods, in the same manner and under the same circumstances as interest would be required to accrue in favor of the member and be payable by the city on such picked up contributions if they were made by the member in the absence of an employer pick up program applicable to such member under the provisions of this section.

   (2) The picked up member contributions of any member paid into the annuity savings fund by the city pursuant to this section shall be credited to a separate account within the individual account of such member in such fund, so that a separate record of the amount of such picked up contributions is maintained.

   (3) Nothing contained in this subdivision d shall be construed as granting member contributions picked up under this section any status, under federal law, other than as employer contributions, pursuant to subsection h of section four hundred fourteen of the United States internal revenue code, for the federal purposes for which such subsection h so classifies such picked up contributions.

e. No member whose member contributions are required to be picked up pursuant to this section shall have any right to elect that such pick up of contributions, with accompanying deduction from the compensation of such member as prescribed by subdivision b of this section, shall not be effectuated.

f. Employer pick-up of contributions in respect of previous service or military service. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any member eligible to purchase credit for previous service with a public employer pursuant to this chapter or to purchase credit for military service pursuant to article twenty of the retirement and social security law, may elect to purchase any or all of such service by executing a periodic payroll deduction agreement where and to the extent such elections are permitted by the retirement system by rule or regulation. Such agreement shall set forth the amount of previous service or military service being purchased, the estimated total cost of such service credit, and the number of payroll periods in which such periodic payments shall be made. Such agreement shall be irrevocable, shall not be subject to amendment or modification in any manner, and shall expire only upon completion of payroll deductions required therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any member who has entered into such a payroll deduction agreement and who terminates employment prior to the completion of the payments required therein shall be credited with any service as to which such member shall have paid the contributions required under the terms of such agreement.






*§ 13-226 Pensions-for-increased-take-home-pay.* ::


a. 1. The mayor, by executive order, adopted prior to the first day of June, nineteen hundred sixty-three, may direct that beginning with the first full payroll period following January first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-four, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by two and one-half percent of the compensation of such member. Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors, and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

The mayor, by executive order, adopted prior to the first day of June, nineteen hundred sixty-four, may direct that beginning with the first full payroll period following July first, nineteen hundred sixty-four, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by two and one-half percent of the compensation of such member. Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors, and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

   3. The mayor, by executive order, adopted prior to June nineteenth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, may direct that beginning with the first full payroll period following July first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by two and one-half percent of the compensation of such member. Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

   6. a. (1) Subject to the provisions of item two of this subparagraph a, beginning with the first full payroll period following January first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by two and one-half per cent of the compensation of such member.

         (2) The reduction provided for by item one of this subparagraph a shall be in addition to any reduction made during the period mentioned in such item one pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision.

      b. The reductions referred to in paragraph a of this subdivision six shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contribution for old age, survivor and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

   7. The mayor, by executive order adopted prior to the date forty-five days after the adjournment of the regular session of the legislature in nineteen hundred seventy-one, may direct that beginning with the payroll period, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-one, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivision c or d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by five per cent of the compensation of such member. Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

   8. The mayor, by executive order adopted prior to the date forty-five days after the adjournment of the regular session of the legislature in nineteen hundred seventy-two or June seventeenth of such year, whichever is later, may direct that beginning with the payroll period, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-two, and ending with the payroll period immediately prior to that, the first day of which is nearest to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-three, the contribution of each member made pursuant to subdivision b or e of section 13-225 of this subchapter, exclusive of any increase thereof pursuant to subdivision c or d of section 13-225 of this subchapter, or of any reduction thereof pursuant to subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, shall be reduced by five per cent of the compensation of such member. Such a reduction shall be subject to waiver by the member as provided in subdivision d of this section and shall take precedence over the member's privilege under subdivision one of section one hundred thirty-eight-b of the retirement and social security law, to decrease his or her annuity contribution for the purpose of paying his or her contributions for old age, survivors and disability insurance coverage or the tax imposed upon him or her pursuant to the federal insurance contribution act.

b. For such period of time as the reduction pursuant to the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be in effect, contributions shall be made to the contingent reserve fund by the city at a rate fixed by the actuary, which shall be computed to be sufficient to provide the death benefit hereunder, and the pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which are or may become payable on account of such member.

c. Such a benefit and such a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be based on a reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay, which shall be a sum consisting of the total of all products obtained by multiplying the compensation of the member, during each period of reduction of member contributions under this section, by the percentage of reduction of his or her contributions applicable under this section with respect to such period, plus regular interest on such sum, and additional interest, if any, thereon.

d. Where a member's rate of contribution is reduced because the city contributes towards the pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay pursuant to this section, such member may by written notice duly acknowledged and filed with the pension fund within one year after such reduction or within one year after he or she last became a member, whichever is later, elect to waive such reduction. One year or more after the filing thereof, a member may withdraw any such waiver by written notice duly acknowledged and filed with the retirement system. Where a member makes an election to waive such reduction he or she shall contribute to the pension fund as otherwise provided in this subchapter.

e. A member who waives a reduction of contribution pursuant to this section or who elects or has elected to discontinue his or her contributions pursuant to subdivision b of section 13-225 of this subchapter shall be entitled to a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay and death benefits to the same extent as if such waiver or election had not been made.

f. The benefits provided pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision a of this section apply only to members of the pension fund who are in active service in the police force on or after the date of adoption of the executive order by the mayor pursuant to such paragraph one.

      (c) (i)    Any amount required by the provisions of items (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and items (ii) and (iv) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph and section 13-704 of this title to be contributed to the contingent reserve fund in the city's nineteen hundred eighty-nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year or any subsequent fiscal year shall be payable with interest on such amount at a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per centum per annum required to be used for the purpose of any actuarial valuation, determination or appraisal made to determine the amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in such fiscal year.

         (ii) Any amount required to be contributed to the contingent reserve fund in any fiscal year of the city preceding the nineteen hundred eighty-nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year shall be deemed to have been required to be paid with interest on such amount at a rate per centum per annum equal to the rate per centum per annum required to be used for the purpose of any actuarial valuation, determination or appraisal made to determine the amount of the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in such fiscal year.

         (iii) It is hereby declared that the provisions of items (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (c), insofar as they relate to provisions of this subchapter or other laws requiring payment of employer contributions to the pension fund prior to the date of enactment of the act which added this subparagraph (c), express the intent of such provisions of this subchapter or other laws requiring such payment.

         (iv) The city shall make all payments to the pension fund required by applicable law in accordance with the time of payment requirements set forth in subdivision c of section 13-231 of this chapter. Commencing with payments due in fiscal year two thousand twelve—two thousand thirteen, in any fiscal year in which the city does not make all or any portion of such required payments to the pension fund in a timely manner, the city shall be required to pay interest to the pension fund on such overdue amounts, as determined by the actuary.

Upon the basis of the latest mortality and other tables herein authorized and regular interest, the actuary shall determine, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the amount of the total liability for all benefits provided in this subchapter, in article eleven of the retirement and social security law, article fourteen of such law (if and when applicable) and in any other law prescribing benefits payable by the pension fund on account of all members and beneficiaries, excluding the liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, and the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund, provided, however, that in determining such total liability for all benefits as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-five and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the actuary shall include (A) the liability on account of future increased-take-home-pay contributions, if any, (B) the liability on account of future public employer obligations under the provisions of subdivision twenty of section two hundred forty-three of the military law, to pay in behalf of members qualifying for such benefit, member contributions with respect to certain periods of the military service of such members and (C) the liability for benefits attributable to the annuity savings fund.

         (ii) For the purposes of subparagraphs (b) and (c) of this paragraph two, the actuary shall determine, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-five and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, the total liability of the pension fund which shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A) the total liability for all benefits as determined pursuant to item (i) of this subparagraph and (B) the amount, as estimated by the actuary, of the total liability of the pension fund on account of all payments which the pension fund may be required to make for base fiscal years (as defined by the applicable provisions of paragraph one of subdivision b of section 13-232.1 of this subchapter and paragraph one of subdivision b of section 13-232.3 of this subchapter) beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four to the police officer's variable supplements fund, pursuant to subdivisions d, e and f of such section 13-232.1 and to the police superior officer's variable supplements fund pursuant to subdivisions d, e and f of such section 13-232.3.

      (a-1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, for the purpose of calculating the amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund pursuant to subparagraph (c) of this paragraph in fiscal year two thousand five-two thousand six, and in each fiscal year thereafter, both the total liability of the pension fund, as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and the normal rate of contribution, as calculated by the actuary in accordance with subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be determined as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, provided, however, that (i) the actuary shall use for such calculations the mortality and other tables that are applicable at the time he or she performs such calculations; (ii) the total funds on hand, as determined by the actuary pursuant to sub-item (F) of item (i) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be adjusted by adding to such amount the present value of all employer contributions required to be paid into the contingent reserve fund in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary; and (iii) the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary for the purposes of item (ii) of subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, shall be reduced by the present value of the salaries expected to be paid to all members in the fiscal year next preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary.

      (b) The normal rate of contribution shall be the rate per centum obtained;

         (i) by deducting from the amount of such total liability the sum of;

            (A) (1) the amount obtained by adding together the present value of all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions and the present value of all required future payments of the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment, determined pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of this subdivision b, if such adjustment is a charge; or

               (2) the remainder obtained by subtracting from the present value of all required future revised unfunded accrued liability contributions, the present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment required to be credited, if such nineteen hundred eighty adjustment is a credit;

               (3) minus (whether (1) or (2) of this sub-item (A) is applicable) the present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment; and

            (A-1) the present value of all future installments of the nineteen hundred eighty-five unfunded accrued liability adjustment determined pursuant to subparagraph (e) of paragraph three of this subdivision b; and

            (C) the present value of all future member contributions on account of dependent benefits; and

            (D) the present value of all required future payments, pursuant to section 13-704 of this title, of installments of losses in excess of installments of gains on dispositions of securities within the meaning of such section; and

            (F) the total funds on hand, including the amount of any unpaid moneys appropriated pursuant to section 13-231 of this subchapter and, in the case of the determination of the normal contribution payable in each fiscal year commencing with fiscal year nineteen hundred ninety-five—nineteen hundred ninety-six, including the amount in the annuity savings fund; and

            (G) the present value of all other future installments of accrued liability contributions to the pension fund required by the applicable provisions of section 13-638.3 of this title which are not covered by the preceding sub-items of this item (i); and

         (ii) by dividing the remainder by one per centum of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members, as computed by the actuary on the basis of the latest mortality and service tables adopted pursuant to section 13-221 of this subchapter, and on the basis of regular interest. The normal rate of contribution determined by the actuary shall not be less than zero, shall be certified by the actuary after each such valuation and shall continue in force until the next succeeding valuation and certification.

      (c) (i) The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund in each city fiscal year, commencing with the nineteen hundred eighty-nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year and ending with the two thousand four-two thousand five fiscal year, shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the normal rate of contribution, as determined by the actuary as of June thirtieth next preceding such fiscal year, by the aggregate annual salaries of the members on such next preceding June thirtieth, and shall be payable in such fiscal year next following such June thirtieth, together with such regular interest thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary.

         (ii) The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund in each city fiscal year, commencing with the two thousand five-two thousand six fiscal year, shall be the amount obtained by multiplying the normal rate of contribution, as determined by the actuary as of the second June thirtieth preceding the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (a-1) and (b) of this paragraph, by the aggregate amount of the salaries expected to be paid to the members during the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable, as determined by the actuary, and such normal contribution shall be payable in the second fiscal year following the June thirtieth as of which the normal rate of contribution is determined, together with such regular interest thereon which may be due, if any, as calculated by the actuary.

         (iii) In the case of the normal contribution payable in the nineteen hundred eighty-nineteen hundred eighty-one fiscal year and in any subsequent fiscal year, the term "regular interest", as used in this subparagraph (c), shall mean regular interest as defined by the applicable provisions of subparagraph (ii) or subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (c) or paragraph (d) of subdivision eight of section 13-214 of this subchapter.

      (d) (i) For the purposes of this subparagraph (d), the terms "pension fund, subchapter one" and "police subchapter one beneficiary" shall have the meanings set forth in paragraphs one and three, respectively, of subdivision a of section 13-213.1 of this chapter.

         (ii) The amount of the normal contribution due from the city to the contingent reserve fund in the city's nineteen hundred ninety-four—nineteen hundred ninety-five fiscal year shall be equal to the amount of the normal contribution for such fiscal year, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, minus the sum (calculated by the actuary to reflect regular interest in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c) of this paragraph) of the following:

            (A) the amount of the assets deemed to have been transferred on July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four from pension fund, subchapter one to this pension fund and credited to the contingent reserve fund in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions b and c of section 13-213.1 of this chapter, as if such transfer actually had been made on such July first; and

            (B) the amount of the benefits payable during the nineteen hundred ninety-four—nineteen hundred ninety-five fiscal year by pension fund, subchapter one to police subchapter one beneficiaries; and

            (C) the amount of supplemental benefits payable during the nineteen hundred ninety-four—nineteen hundred ninety-five fiscal year, including the increase in certain of such benefits provided by paragraph four of subdivision a of section 13-687 of this title, as added by the chapter of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-five which added this subparagraph, by the city supplemental pension fund established under section 13-650 of this title to police subchapter one beneficiaries.

      (e) (i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs of this paragraph or any other provision of law to the contrary, the normal contribution payable to the contingent reserve fund in fiscal year two thousand eleven—two thousand twelve, and in each fiscal year thereafter, shall be the entry age normal contribution, as determined by the actuary pursuant to this subparagraph in a manner consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method. The actuary shall determine the entry age normal contribution for each such fiscal year as of June thirtieth of the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which such normal contribution is payable, based on the latest mortality and other tables applicable at the time he or she performs such calculations, and the valuation rate of interest as provided for the pension fund in paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-638.2 of this title.

         (ii) In calculating the entry age normal contribution payable in any such fiscal year pursuant to this subparagraph, the actuary, in his or her discretion, may make certain adjustments in the calculation methodology, provided that such adjustments are generally accepted as consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and are designed, in general, to fund, on a level basis over the working lifetimes of members from their ages at entry, the actuarial present value of benefits to which such members are expected to become entitled, as determined by the actuary. Such generally accepted adjustments in the calculation methodology, in the discretion of the actuary, may include, but are not limited to, the calculation of the entry age normal contribution (A) on an individual member basis by calculating the amount of the entry age normal contribution attributable to each individual member, and then adding together such individual member amounts, (B) on an aggregate basis for all members or (C) on any combination of an individual member basis and an aggregate basis which is consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and the preceding provisions of this item.

         (iii) For each such fiscal year, the actuary, in his or her discretion, shall determine, in accordance with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph, the methodology for calculating the entry age normal contribution payable for that particular fiscal year.

         (iv) The methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate the entry age normal contribution on an individual member basis by (A) multiplying the entry age normal contribution rate for each individual member, as determined by the actuary, by the salary expected to be paid to that member during the fiscal year in which such normal contribution is payable, and (B) calculating the sum of the individual entry age normal contributions attributable to all such members. The actuary, in his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for determining the entry age normal contribution on an individual basis which he or she deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.

         (v) In the alternative, the methodology determined by the actuary in accordance with item (iii) of this subparagraph may provide for the actuary to calculate the entry age normal contribution on an aggregate basis by multiplying the entry age normal contribution rate for all members in the aggregate, as determined by the actuary, by the aggregate amount of the salaries expected to be paid to all members during the fiscal year in which the normal contribution is payable. The actuary, in his or her discretion, may make any adjustments to such methodology for determining the entry age normal contribution on an aggregate basis which he or she deems appropriate, and which are consistent with the provisions of item (ii) of this subparagraph.

a. Such board shall annually allow regular interest on the mean amount for the preceding year in each of the funds provided for in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The amount so allowed shall be due and payable to such funds, and shall be annually credited thereto by such board.

b. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four, shall be credited as of December thirty-first nineteen hundred sixty-four to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-four had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision c hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

c. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to paragraph b hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to paragraph b hereof additional interest, as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-five, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-four shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to paragraph b hereof is ten dollars or more. Additional interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

d. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five, shall be credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision e hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

e. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to subdivision d hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to subdivision d hereof, additional interest as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-six, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-five shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision d hereof is ten dollars or more. Additional interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

f. The investment earnings of the retirement system shall be determined for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. To the extent that such earnings are in excess of the amount allowed as regular interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, the board shall declare a rate of special interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the amount required for the allowance of regular interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six in the annuity savings funds of members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. Special interest, as determined by multiplying said special interest rate by the mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six in the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be credited as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six to the individual annuity savings funds of persons who are members, with a balance, after adjustment, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and who are allowed regular interest at the rate of three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six. For members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six and who do not have a balance, after adjustment, in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, a payment shall be made equal to the amount of special interest which would have been credited as of December thirty-first nineteen hundred sixty-six had they had a balance in their annuity savings funds as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, provided that the sum of said special interest and any additional interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision g hereof is ten dollars or more. Special interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

g. If the full one per centum of special interest has been allowed, then to the extent that the amount of said earnings exceeds the amount allowed as regular interest and the amount allowed or paid as special interest, the board shall declare a rate of additional interest, expressed to the lower one-tenth of one per centum, but not to exceed one per centum, to be determined by the amount by which the investment earnings exceed the sum of the allowance of regular interest and the allowance and payment of special interest divided by the aggregate mean amount for the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six which would be the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of all members to whom special interest is credited or paid pursuant to subdivision f hereof. In determining the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of any member to whom special interest is credited pursuant to subdivision f hereof, additional interest as determined by multiplying said additional interest rate by the mean amount for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six which would be said member's reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be included. However, for members who are allowed regular interest at three per centum per annum for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six and who retire or die prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, the amount of additional interest for calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six shall not be included in the retirement allowance, but shall be paid in a single payment provided that the sum of said additional interest and any special interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision f hereof is ten dollars or more. Additional interest shall not be considered in determining rates of contribution of members.

Such retiree's eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-244 of this subchapter, shall be entitled to an accidental death benefit as provided by section 13-244 of this subchapter, however, for the purposes of determining the salary base upon which the accidental death benefit is calculated, the retiree shall be deemed to have died on the date of his or her retirement. Upon the retiree's death, the eligible beneficiary shall make a written application to the head of the retirement system within the time for filing an application for an accidental death benefit as set forth in section 13-244 of this subchapter requesting conversion of such retiree's service or disability retirement benefit to an accidental death benefit. At the time of such conversion, the eligible beneficiary shall relinquish all rights to the prospective benefits payable under the service or disability retirement benefit, including any post-retirement death benefits, since the retiree's death. If the eligible beneficiary is not the only beneficiary receiving or entitled to receive a benefit under the service or disability retirement benefit (including, but not limited to, post-retirement death benefits or benefits paid or payable pursuant to the retiree's option selection), the accidental death benefit payments to the eligible beneficiary will be reduced by any amounts paid or payable to any other beneficiary.

4. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code or of any general, special or local law, charter, or rule or regulation to the contrary, if a member who: (1) has met the criteria of subdivision one of this section; and (2) dies in active service from a qualifying World Trade Center condition, as defined in section two of the retirement and social security law, as determined by the applicable head of the retirement system or applicable medical board to have been caused by such member's participation in the World Trade Center rescue, recovery or cleanup operations, as defined in section two of the retirement and social security law, then unless the contrary be proven by competent evidence, such member shall be deemed to have died as a natural and proximate result of an accident sustained in the performance of duty and not as a result of willful negligence on his or her part. Such member's eligible beneficiary, as set forth in section 13-244 of this subchapter, shall be entitled to an accidental death benefit provided he or she makes written application to the head of the retirement system within the time for filing an application for an accidental death benefit as set forth in section 13-244 of this subchapter.






*§ 13-253 Dependent benefits for surviving spouses and orphans.* ::


a. The board shall pay a dependent benefit to the surviving spouse, child or children or dependent parent or parents of any deceased member if the death of such member occur during his or her service or after he or she was retired from service. The amount of any such dependent benefit to be paid by the board to each of the several representatives of such member, in case there shall be more than one, from time to time, may be determined by such board according to the circumstances of each case. The annual dependent benefit to the representative or representatives of such member, however, shall be six hundred dollars, and no part of such sum shall be paid to any such surviving spouse who shall remarry, after such remarriage, or to any child after it shall have reached the age of eighteen years.

b. Dependent benefits shall be granted to the surviving spouse, child or children or dependent parent or parents of a member pursuant to this section only if such member, upon becoming a member, shall elect to contribute the additional deductions provided by subdivision d of section 13-227 of this subchapter.

c. The benefits granted pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other benefit provided for by this subchapter.






*§ 13-254 Safeguards on disability retirement.* ::


a. Once each year the board may, and upon his or her application shall, require any disability pensioner, under the minimum age or period for service retirement elected by him or her, to undergo medical examination. Such examination shall be made at the place of residence of such beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon. Upon the completion of such examination the medical board shall report and certify to the board whether such beneficiary is or is not totally or partially incapacitated physically or mentally and whether he or she is or is not engaged in or able to engage in a gainful occupation. If the board concurs in a report by the medical board that such beneficiary is able to engage in a gainful occupation, he or she shall certify the name of such beneficiary to the appropriate civil service commission, state or municipal, and such commission shall place his or her name as a preferred eligible on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to positions for which he or she is stated to be qualified. Should such beneficiary be engaged in a gainful occupation, or should he or she be offered city-service as a result of the placing of his or her name on a civil service list, such board shall reduce the amount of his or her disability pension and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, to an amount which, when added to that then earned by him or her, or earnable by him or her in city-service so offered him or her, shall not exceed the current maximum salary for the title next higher than that held by him or her when he or she was retired. Should the earning capacity of such beneficiary be further altered, such board may further alter his or her pension and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, to an amount which shall not exceed the rate of pension and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, upon which he or she was originally retired but which, subject to such limitation, shall equal, when added to that earnable by him or her, the current maximum salary for the title next higher than that held by him or her when he or she was retired. The provisions of this section shall be executed, any provision of the charter or the code to the contrary notwithstanding.

b. Should any disability pensioner, under the minimum age or period for service retirement elected by him or her, refuse to submit to one medical examination in any year by a physician or physicians designated by the medical board, his or her pension and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal. Should such refusal continue for one year, all his or her rights in and to such pension and his or her pension-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any, may be revoked by such board.






*§ 13-255 Retirement allowances; for service.* ::


Upon retirement for service, a member shall receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of:

1. An annuity based on his or her required annuity savings at the termination of his or her required minimum period of service, and in addition, a pension which when added to the annuity shall be equal to one-half of his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of retirement, for his or her minimum period of service. For the purpose only of determining the pension portion of the retirement allowance for minimum service, the member's annuity shall be computed as it would be, (a) if it were not reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any outstanding loan, (b) if it were not increased by the actuarial equivalent of any additional contributions, (c) if it were not reduced by reason of the member's election to decrease his or her annuity contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction in payment of his or her contributions for old-age and survivors insurance coverage, (d) as it would be without any optional modification;

2. For each additional year of service in the police force, or fraction thereof, beyond his or her required minimum service, a member shall be entitled to, in addition to the benefits provided in subdivision one of this section:

   (a) a pension of one-sixtieth of his or her average annual earnings from his or her date of eligibility for retirement to the actual date of retirement; and

   (b) a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which he or she may be entitled, if any, for all periods of such service in the police force rendered both (1) after the completion of such required minimum service in such police force and (2) after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.

3. For each year, or fraction thereof, of service credit transferred from the New York city employees' retirement system, a pension of fiftyfive per cent of one-sixtieth of his or her final compensation if such service credit was for service rendered prior to October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, or seventy-five per cent of one-sixtieth of his or her final compensation if such service was rendered subsequent to October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one.






*§ 13-256 Vested retirement rights.* ::


a. Any member who:

   (1) discontinues police service on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, other than by death, retirement or dismissal; and

   (3) does not withdraw his or her accumulated deductions in whole or in part; and

   (4) at least thirty days prior to the date of such discontinuance, files a duly executed application for a deferred retirement allowance hereunder; shall have a vested right to receive a deferred retirement allowance as provided in this section.

b. (1) Upon such discontinuance under the conditions and in compliance with the provisions of subdivision a of this section, such deferred retirement allowance shall vest automatically.

   (2) Such retirement allowance shall become payable on the earliest date on which such discontinued member could have retired for service if discontinuance had not occurred.

c. Such deferred retirement allowance shall consist of:

   (1) an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of an amount equal to the member's accumulated deductions for the period of his or her police service, plus any accumulated contributions transferred to his or her credit pursuant to section forty-three of the retirement and social security law, as the total of such accumulated deductions and contributions is on the earliest date on which such member could have retired for service; and

   (2) a pension, which together with his or her annuity shall be equal to:

      (i) in the case of any discontinued member whose minimum period for service retirement is twenty years, two and one-half per cent of his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of his or her discontinuance of police service, multiplied by a number equal to the number of years of allowable police service credited to him or her on the date of such discontinuance, plus the number of his or her years of service for which credit was transferred pursuant to section forty-three of the retirement and social security law; or

      (ii) in the case of any discontinued member whose minimum period for service retirement is twenty-five years, two per cent of his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of his or her discontinuance of police service, multiplied by a number equal to the number of years of allowable police service credited to him or her on the date of his or her discontinuance of police service, plus the number of years of his or her service for which credit was transferred pursuant to section forty-three of the retirement and social security law; and

      (3) for each year, or fraction thereof, of his or her service credit transferred from the New York city employees' retirement system, a pension of fifty-five per cent of one-sixtieth of his or her final compensation if such service credit was for service rendered prior to October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, or seventy-five per cent of one-sixtieth of his or her final compensation if such service was rendered on or after October first, nineteen hundred fifty-one.

d. For the purpose only of determining the pension portion of such retirement allowance pursuant to paragraphs one and two of subdivision c of this section, the annuity referred to in such paragraph one shall be computed as it would be (1) if it were not reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any outstanding loan, (2) if it were not increased by the actuarial equivalent of any additional contributions, (3) if it were not reduced by reason of the member's election to decrease his or her annuity contributions in order to apply the amount of such reduction in payment of his or her contributions for old-age and survivors insurance coverage and (4) as it would be without any optional modification.

e. Regular interest on the accumulated deductions of a discontinued member and on his or her reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay shall be credited after discontinuance of police service at the rate which would be applicable if he or she had not discontinued service.

f. If a discontinued member dies before attaining the earliest age at which he or she could have retired for service if discontinuance had not occurred, his or her accumulated deductions shall be paid (1) to the beneficiary designated by him or her pursuant to section 13-243 of this subchapter to receive his or her accumulated deductions in the event that such deductions were to become payable under such section, or (2) if such member had made no such designation, to his or her estate.

g. A discontinued member may elect any option under section 13-261 of this subchapter at any time prior to the first payment on account of his or her retirement allowance under this section.

h. Withdrawal of accumulated deductions, in whole or in part, after discontinuance of police service, shall terminate the right to a deferred retirement allowance under this section.

i. If a discontinued member who has not withdrawn his or her accumulated deductions in whole or in part shall subsequently re-enter police service before the earliest date on which such discontinued member could have retired for service if discontinuance had not occurred, he or she shall be entitled to the service credit and status to which he or she was entitled immediately prior to his or her discontinuance of police service and shall be credited with regular interest on his or her accumulated deductions and his or her reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay from the time of such discontinuance to the time of his or her re-entry into service, at the rate which would have been applicable if he or she had not discontinued service.

j. (1) If a discontinued member who has not withdrawn his or her accumulated deductions in whole or in part shall subsequently and on or after the earliest date on which such discontinued member could have retired for service if discontinuance had not occurred, re-enter police service, the payment of his or her pension only shall be suspended and forfeited during the period of such police service, except as herein otherwise provided.

   (2) Such member may again become a member of the pension fund if, within ninety days after his or her return to service, he or she files a duly executed and acknowledged application for such membership.

   (3) If such beneficiary shall again become a member of the pension fund, the payment of his or her annuity shall also be suspended and forfeited and his or her annuity reserve shall be transferred to his or her credit in the annuity savings fund and he or she shall become such member as a new entrant; provided, however, that he or she shall contribute to such fund at the rate (before modification, if any, to which such discontinued member may be entitled pursuant to section 13-226 of this subchapter) at which he or she would have been contributing if he or she had not discontinued police service. Upon his or her subsequent retirement, he or she shall be credited with all of his or her service as a member subsequent to his or her last restoration to membership and he or she shall receive therefor a retirement allowance, payable in such form as he or she shall select under section 13-261 of this subchapter, consisting of:

      (i) an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of his or her accumulated deductions at the time of such retirement; and

      (ii) a pension equal to one-sixtieth of his or her average annual earnings from the date of his or her re-entry into membership to the date of his or her subsequent retirement, multiplied by the number of years of his or her allowable service in the police force rendered by him or her from such date of re-entry; and

      (iii) a pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay which is the actuarial equivalent of the reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay to which he or she may be entitled, if any, for the period of his or her allowable service in the police force rendered by him or her from such date of re-entry.

   (4) In addition, upon his or her subsequent retirement, he or she shall receive the pension which he or she was receiving or entitled to receive immediately prior to his or her last restoration.

   (5) In lieu of suspension during restoration to police service of any benefits payable in the event of his or her death by reason of any optional selection in respect to his or her pension, any such beneficiary may pay to the fund or funds from which his or her ordinary pension was payable, the amount by which his or her ordinary pension exceeded the optional pension heretofore granted to him or her, in which event such optional benefit shall continue and be payable in the event of his or her death as though no payment was suspended.

k. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a discontinued member with ten or more years of credited service in the pension fund who dies before a retirement benefit becomes payable and who is otherwise not entitled to a death benefit from the pension fund shall be deemed to have died on the last day that he or she was in service upon which his or her membership was based for purposes of eligibility for the payment of a death benefit pursuant to the provisions of section 13-243 of this title. The death benefit payable in such case shall be one-half of that which would have been payable had such member died on the last day that service was rendered.






*§ 13-256.1 Discharge or dismissal.* ::

Such member shall be deemed to be retired on the date of his or her discharge or dismissal from service for purposes of determining his or her rights and benefits as a member of the retirement system.

b. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subdivision a of this section, a member, other than a member to which article fourteen of the retirement and social security law is applicable, that has attained at least twenty years of creditable service in the retirement system shall forfeit the retirement benefits to which the member would otherwise be entitled if the member is convicted under the laws of the state of New York of a felony, or under the laws of another state or of the United States of an offense or crime which, if committed in the state of New York, would be a felony.

c. Nothing in this section shall be construed to in any way modify or affect the rights or benefits of any member of the retirement system to which article fourteen of the retirement and social security law is applicable.

c. (1) In the case of a member who contributes on the basis of retirement at age fifty-five the retirement allowance that would be payable to him or her after a like amount of total-service and annual earnable compensation on the date of retirement, had he or she attained his or her minimum age for service retirement if such retirement allowance exceeds one-quarter of his or her annual earnable compensation on the date of retirement; otherwise,

   (2) The retirement allowance not exceeding one-quarter of his or her annual earnable compensation on date of retirement, that would be paid to him or her were his or her service and present annual earnable compensation on the date of retirement to continue until attainment by him or her of his or her minimum age of service retirement.

If a lump sum which has been paid or which is payable under the provisions of the workers' compensation law equals or exceeds the present value of all amounts otherwise payable out of moneys provided or to be provided by the city under the provisions of this subchapter on account of the same disability of the same person, no payment shall be made to such person under the provisions of this subchapter. If such lump sum be a percentage less than one hundred per cent of the present value of all such amounts, there shall be paid as it becomes due under the provisions of this subchapter, in lieu of each amount otherwise payable, an amount equal to the percentage thereof which is the difference between such lesser per cent and one hundred per cent.

b. If an amount which is payable throughout a period under the provisions of the workers' compensation law equals or exceeds the amounts otherwise payable during the same period out of the moneys provided or to be provided by the city under the provisions of this article on account of the same disability of the same person, no payment shall be made to such person under the provisions of this subchapter during such period nor thereafter, until the total amount of such omitted payments, together with the regular interest which they would have accumulated, equals the amount paid under the workers' compensation law, together with the regular interest which it would have accumulated.

c. No decision of the workers' compensation board shall be binding on the medical board or on the board in the determination of eligibility of a claimant for an accident disability or an accidental death benefit.

d. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section or any other law to the contrary, pending the final determination of a claim for workers' compensation benefits, the board may authorize payment of all or any part of the benefits which are payable under this subchapter and to which any of the foregoing provisions of this section apply, and in that event the pension fund shall be entitled to reimbursement out of the unpaid installment or installments of compensation due under the workers' compensation law provided that claim therefor is filed with the workers' compensation board, together with proof of the fact and amount of payment.

a. Until the first payment on account of any benefit is made, except pursuant to the provisions of section 13-261.2 of this subchapter, the beneficiary, or, if such beneficiary is an incompetent, then the husband or wife of such beneficiary, or, if there be no husband or wife, a committee of the estate, may elect to receive such benefit in a retirement allowance payable throughout life, or the beneficiary or the husband or wife or committee so electing may then elect to receive the actuarial equivalent at that time of his or her annuity, his or her pension, or his or her retirement allowance in a lesser annuity or a lesser pension or a lesser retirement allowance, payable throughout life with the provision that: Option 1. If he or she die before he or she has received in payments the present value of his or her annuity, his or her pension, or his or her retirement allowance, as it was at the time of his or her retirement, the balance shall be paid to his or her legal representatives or to such person as the beneficiary, or the husband or wife or committee so electing, has nominated or shall nominate by written designation duly acknowledged and filed with the board.

Option 4. Upon his or her death, some other benefit or benefits shall be paid to such other person or persons as the beneficiary, or the husband or wife or committee so electing, has nominated or shall nominate, provided such other benefit or benefits, together with such lesser annuity, or lesser pension, or lesser retirement allowance, shall be certified by the actuary to be of equivalent actuarial value to his or her annuity, his or her pension or his or her retirement allowance, and shall be approved by such board.

b. For purposes of this section, the terms "pension" and "retirement allowance" shall be deemed to include the pension-providing-for-increased-take-home-pay, if any.






*§ 13-261.1 Modified Option 1 pension computation formula.* ::


a. The board may by resolution direct that under such circumstances as are designated in such resolution, benefits under Option 1 which consist of or are derived from the pension component of a retirement allowance and which are payable to or on account of members who:

   (1) became members prior to the date of enactment (as certified pursuant to section forty-one of the legislative law) of this section; and

   (2) retired or retire, on or after August first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, for service or superannuation or for ordinary or accident disability, or on or after such August first, discontinued or discontinue service so as to become a discontinued member; shall be determined under the modified Option 1 pension computation formula (as defined in subdivision twenty-eight of section 13-214 of the code).

   (1) that any member who is subject to the modified Option 1 pension computation formula may elect, at such time and in accordance with such procedures as are prescribed in such resolution, that such formula shall not apply to such member and that the initial reserve determined for the purpose of providing the benefits payable by reason of his or her selection of Option 1 and the pension component of his or her Option 1 allowance shall be determined on the basis of gender-neutral mortality tables and regular interest of seven per centum per annum, compounded annually; and

   (2) that the benefit payable, upon the death of the member making such election, to his or her beneficiary or estate shall be the difference between such Option 1 initial reserve and the total of the payments of such pension component received by or payable to such member for the period prior to his or her death; and

   (3) that where any member subject to the modified Option 1 pension computation formula retired before the effective date of the board resolution adopted pursuant to subdivision a of this section, and where the first payment on account of the retirement allowance of any discontinued member subject to such formula was made before the effective date of such resolution, such retiree or discontinued member, within such period of time after such effective date and in accordance with such procedures as are prescribed in such resolution, may elect the method of Option 1 benefit determination set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision b.

c. In any case, where, pursuant to board resolution, a benefit is required to be determined under the modified Option 1 pension computation formula and the determination of such benefit is also required by a board resolution adopted pursuant to sub-item (3) of item (A) of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (g) of subdivision eight of section 13-214 of the code to reflect different computations of separate portions of such benefit, the methods of computation under the modified Option 1 pension computation formula shall be appropriately adjusted so as to give effect to the provisions of such resolution adopted pursuant to such sub-item (3).






*§ 13-261.2 Death of applicant before effective date of retirement.* ::

   1. if a member is entitled to an ordinary disability retirement allowance under the provisions of this subchapter, the benefits provided pursuant to section 13-251 of this subchapter shall be payable unless the member would otherwise be entitled to a greater benefit pursuant to section 13-243 of this subchapter, in which event the greater benefit shall be payable; or

   2. if a member is entitled to an accidental disability retirement allowance under the provisions of this subchapter, the benefits provided pursuant to section 13-252 of this subchapter shall be payable unless the member would otherwise be entitled to a greater benefit pursuant to section 13-244 of this subchapter, in which event the greater benefit shall be payable.

The excess benefit plan shall be administered by the board of trustees of the pension fund.

c. There is hereby established a fund to be known as the excess benefit fund which shall be maintained for the sole purpose of providing replacement benefits to eligible participants in the excess benefit plan established by this section, as permitted under section 415(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such fund shall consist of such employer contributions as shall be made thereto pursuant to subdivision f of this section.

No beneficiary of the pension fund shall be an eligible participant in the excess benefit plan for any plan year for which his or her retirement benefits are not reduced because of section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.

e. (1) For each plan year in which a beneficiary is an eligible participant in the excess benefit plan, such eligible participant shall receive replacement benefits from the excess benefit plan equal to the difference between the full amount of the retirement benefits otherwise payable to the eligible participant for that plan year prior to any reduction because of section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the retirement benefits payable to the eligible participant for that plan year as reduced because of section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. No replacement benefits for any plan year shall be paid pursuant to this subdivision to any beneficiary who is not receiving retirement benefits from the pension fund for that plan year.

   (2) Replacement benefits pursuant to this section shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the retirement benefits which are being replaced. At no time shall an eligible participant be permitted directly or indirectly to defer compensation under the excess benefit plan.

f. (1) The required employer contributions to the excess benefit fund for each plan year shall be an amount, as determined by the actuary, which is necessary to pay the total amount of replacement benefits that are payable pursuant to this section to eligible participants for that plan year.

   (2) Such required employer contributions shall be paid into the excess benefit fund from an allocation of the employer contribution amounts paid pursuant to section 13-228 of this subchapter and other applicable provisions of law. Such allocation of employer contribution amounts shall be paid into the excess benefit fund at such times and in such amounts as determined by the actuary.

   (3) The benefit liabilities of the excess benefit plan shall be funded on a plan year to plan year basis, provided, however, that any employer contributions to the excess benefit fund, including any investment earnings on such contributions, which are not used to pay replacement benefits for the current plan year shall be used to pay replacement benefits for future plan years.

g. The right of an eligible participant to receive replacement benefits pursuant to this section, and the replacement benefits received pursuant to this section, shall be exempt from any state or municipal tax, and shall not be subject to execution, garnishment, attachment or any other process whatsoever, and shall be unassignable, except as otherwise specifically provided for benefits payable by the pension fund.

h. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to mean or imply that variable supplements payments from a variable supplements fund established pursuant to subchapter three or four of this chapter constitute pension or retirement allowance payments, or that any such variable supplements fund constitutes a pension or retirement system or fund.

i. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as affecting in any way the eligibility of any person for variable supplements pursuant to applicable provisions of subchapter three or four of this chapter.

   (3) The provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision shall not apply to or affect (i) the allowance of interest or the crediting of interest to accounts of members or discontinued members in the annuity savings fund or (ii) the allowance of interest on or the crediting of interest to reserve-for-increased-take-home-pay of members or discontinued members or (iii) the determination of the amount of any benefit payable to any member or beneficiary of a retirement system.

j. On or after September first of the last city fiscal year for which special, additional and supplementary interest are allowed with respect to a retirement system pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions f, g and i of this section, and no later than December thirty-first next succeeding such September first, the board of trustees of such retirement system shall submit to the public officers and body referred to in subdivision e of this section the written recommendations of such board:

   (1) as to whether legislation should be enacted providing for the crediting of special interest to members of such retirement system after such last fiscal year and if so, the recommended rate thereof and duration of such crediting; and

   (2) as to whether legislation should be enacted providing that in the determination of reserves-for-increased-take-home-pay of members of such retirement system entitled to such a reserve, additional interest shall be included for any period after such last fiscal year, and if so, the recommended rate thereof and the period as to which such interest should be included; and

   (3) as to whether legislation should be enacted providing for the crediting of supplementary interest after such last fiscal year to funds creditable with supplementary interest of such retirement system and if so, the recommended rate thereof and duration of such crediting.

k. (1) (i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, in any case where the valuation rate of interest for a retirement system is changed by law for any period beginning on or after July first, two thousand four, or where the board of trustees of a retirement system, for any period beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, adopts changed actuarial tables used in valuing the liabilities of such retirement system, or where a significant change in an actuarial valuation method (as defined in paragraph sixteen of subdivision a of this section) is made for any period beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine in relation to a retirement system, the actuary thereof shall calculate, as of June thirtieth next preceding the first day of the fiscal year for which such changed rate or changed tables or significant change in an actuarial valuation method first becomes or became effective, an unfunded accrued liability adjustment applicable to each responsible obligor in relation to such retirement system, provided, however, that no unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be established under this subdivision for any retirement system with respect to any change in the valuation rate of interest, change in actuarial tables or significant change in an actuarial valuation method where such changed valuation rate of interest, actuarial tables or actuarial valuation method applies to such retirement system with respect to any actuarial valuation performed by the actuary as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten or as of any date thereafter.

      (ii) Any such adjustment (or adjustments in the aggregate) shall be designed to amortize in installments over a period and by such method as shall be established by the board of trustees or retirement board of such retirement system on the recommendation of its actuary, and commencing on such first day, the increase or decrease in the actuarial accrued liability of such retirement system or pension fund resulting from any such change or changes. Such period of amortization shall be not less than ten city fiscal years nor more than twenty such years.

      (iii) No unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be established under this subdivision for any retirement system with respect to any change in actuarial tables or significant change in an actuarial valuation method, where such changed tables or changed method apply or applies to such retirement system with respect to determination of any of the NYCERS 1999 UAL, the NYCTRS 1999 UAL, the BERS 1999 UAL, the PPF 1999 UAL (as defined in paragraph thirty-two of subdivision a of section 13-638.3 of the code, as added by chapter six hundred eight of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-one) or the FPF 1999 UAL (as defined in paragraph thirty-two of subdivision a of section 13-638.3 of the code, as added by chapter six hundred ten of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-one), whether such change is adopted before or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be construed as requiring the continuation after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-nine of the amortization of any unfunded accrued liability adjustment established under this subdivision prior to such June thirtieth.

      (iv) No unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be established under this subdivision for any retirement system with respect to any change in the valuation rate of interest, change in actuarial tables or significant change in an actuarial valuation method if (A) such unfunded accrued liabilities, when added to any existing unfunded accrued liability, would result in the total of all unfunded accrued liabilities for that retirement system equaling less than zero, or if (B) the change in unfunded actuarial liability for that retirement system would cause an increase or decrease of less than ten percent in the actuarial accrued liability (computed pursuant to the entry age normal cost method of determining such liability) and the actuary concludes that such an unfunded accrued liability need not be established.

   (2) Subject to the provisions of the succeeding paragraphs of this subdivision and subdivision 1 of this section, each such unfunded accrued liability adjustment shall be calculated with respect to the affected responsible obligor, and shall be paid by or credited to such obligor, as the case may be, in accordance with the appropriate methods set forth in subdivisions b to v, inclusive, of section 13-638.1 of this subchapter.

   (3) (i) Each such unfunded accrued liability adjustment (other than any such adjustment attributable to employees of the senior colleges of the city university) shall be known by a title consisting of the numerical designation of the calendar year in which the first fiscal year of the applicable amortization period begins, followed by the words "unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to," followed by the name of the responsible obligor with respect to which such adjustment was calculated.

      (ii) Each such unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to employees of such senior colleges which is calculated for NYCERS shall be known by a title consisting of the numerical designation of the calendar year in which the first fiscal year of the applicable amortization period begins, followed by the words "NYCERS unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to the senior colleges."

      (iii) Each such unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to employees of such senior colleges which is calculated for NYCTRS shall be known by a title consisting of the numerical designation of the calendar year in which the first fiscal year of the applicable amortization period begins, followed by the words "NYCTRS unfunded accrued liability adjustment attributable to the senior colleges."

   (4) For the purpose of applying the provisions of subdivisions b to v, inclusive, of section 13-638.1 as prescribed by paragraph two of this subdivision:

      (i) the term "valuation rate of interest" appearing in such provisions shall mean the applicable valuation rate of interest, as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of this section; and

      (ii) wherever the words "nineteen hundred eighty-seven-nineteen hundred eighty-eight fiscal year" appear in such subdivisions, there shall be deemed to be substituted therefor the numerical designation of the city fiscal year next preceding the first fiscal year of the amortization period applicable pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision; and

      (iii) wherever the words, "nineteen hundred eighty-eight-nineteen hundred eighty-nine fiscal year" appear in such subdivisions, there shall be deemed to be substituted therefor the numerical designation of the first city fiscal year of such amortization period; and

      (iv) wherever the words "June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-eight" appear in such subdivisions, there shall be deemed to be substituted therefor the numerical designation of the month, day and year of the June thirtieth next preceding the first day of such amortization period; and

      (v) wherever the words "nineteen hundred eighty-eight unfunded accrued liability adjustment" appear in such subdivisions, there shall be deemed to be substituted therefor the numerical designation of the calendar year in which such amortization period begins, followed by the words "unfunded accrued liability adjustment"; and

      (vi) wherever the words "nineteen hundred ninety-seven-nineteen hundred ninety-eight" appear in such subdivisions, there shall be deemed to be substituted therefor the numerical designation of the last city fiscal year of the applicable amortization period.

k-1. All installments of contribution resulting from any unfunded accrued liability established for any retirement system prior to the establishment of the unfunded accrued liability as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten for the retirement systems pursuant to the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision k-2 of this section which are payable to any retirement system on or after July first, two thousand eleven are hereby canceled and shall not be due and payable on or after such July first.

k-2. (1) (i) The actuary for each of the retirement systems (as defined in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section), upon the basis of the latest mortality and other tables applicable at the time he or she performs the calculations, and the valuation rate of interest (as defined in paragraph eleven of subdivision a of this section), shall calculate separately for each of the retirement systems, as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, an unfunded accrued liability for each of the retirement systems in accordance with the succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph.

      (ii) The actuary shall calculate, as of the applicable June thirtieth, an amount equal to the sum of (A) the total actuarial present value of all benefits payable by the retirement system pursuant to applicable law, as determined by the actuary, and (B) the liability of the retirement system, as determined by the actuary, for amounts which the retirement system may be required by applicable law to pay to any other fund on account of related benefits financed through the retirement system, without a corresponding offset in the liabilities of the retirement system.

      (iii) The unfunded accrued liability of the retirement system as of the applicable June thirtieth shall be the amount obtained by deducting from the amount of such total liability of the retirement system on account of benefits, as determined by the actuary pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the sum of:

         (A) the actuarial present value of entry age normal contributions payable to the retirement system, as determined by the actuary as of the applicable June thirtieth in a manner consistent with the entry age actuarial cost method, and with the applicable methodologies set forth for NYCERS in subparagraph (d) of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-127 of this title, for the PPF in subparagraph (e) of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-228 of this title, for the FPF in subparagraph (e) of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 13-331 of this title, for the NYCTRS in paragraph five of subdivision b of section 13-527 of this title or for BERS in item (v) of subparagraph four of paragraph (c) of subdivision sixteen of section twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the education law;

         (B) the present value of future member contributions of all members of the retirement system, as determined by the actuary as of the applicable June thirtieth;

         (C) the total funds on hand of the retirement system, as determined by the actuary as of the applicable June thirtieth; and

         (D) the present value of future installments of unfunded accrued liability contributions to the retirement system.

      (iv) The actuary, in determining the unfunded accrued liability pursuant to this paragraph, may make any adjustments which he or she deems appropriate due to the calculation of the unfunded accrued liability as of the second June thirtieth preceding the fiscal year in which the first installment of such unfunded accrued liability becomes payable or creditable.

   (2) (i) The unfunded accrued liability calculated by the actuary as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten for each retirement system pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision shall be known as the "2010 UAL" or, with respect to NYCERS as the "NYCERS 2010 UAL", with respect to NYCTRS as the "NYCTRS 2010 UAL", with respect to the PPF as the "PPF 2010 UAL", with respect to the FPF as the "FPF 2010 UAL" and with respect to BERS as the "BERS 2010 UAL".

      (ii) The 2010 UAL for each retirement system shall be amortized in twenty-one annual installments, as determined by the actuary, payable over a period of twenty-two fiscal years following its establishment as of June thirtieth, two thousand ten, with payments commencing with the two thousand eleven—two thousand twelve fiscal year. The actuary for each of the retirement systems shall determine the schedule of contribution installments so that each installment after the first shall equal one hundred three per centum of the next preceding installment.

   (3) (i) The unfunded accrued liability calculated pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision by the actuary as of June thirtieth, two thousand eleven, and as of each succeeding June thirtieth, shall be known as a "post-2010 UAL adjustment". With respect to each retirement system, such unfunded accrued liability shall be known by the name consisting of the applicable abbreviation for the retirement system, as defined in paragraph three, four, five, six or seven of subdivision a of this section, followed by the calendar year as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established, followed by the term "UAL adjustment".

      (ii) Each post-2010 UAL adjustment for each retirement system shall be amortized in equal installments payable or creditable, as determined by the actuary, as follows:

         (A) that portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which is attributable to actuarial gains or losses, as determined by the actuary, shall be amortized in fourteen annual installments, as determined by the actuary, payable or creditable over a period of fifteen fiscal years following the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established, with payments or credits commencing with the second fiscal year succeeding the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established, provided, however, that the portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which is attributable to actuarial gains and losses shall be an amount equal to the total amount of such post-2010 UAL adjustment minus an amount equal to the sum of the portions of such post-2010 UAL adjustment, if any, which are attributable to (1) changes in the valuation rate of interest, changes in actuarial tables and changes in actuarial methods, as determined by the actuary pursuant to item (B) of this subparagraph, and (2) recently enacted changes in benefits which were not incorporated in the unfunded accrued liability established as of the preceding June thirtieth, as determined by the actuary pursuant to item (C) of this subparagraph;

         (B) that portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which is attributable to changes in the valuation rate of interest, changes in actuarial tables or changes in actuarial methods, as determined by the actuary, shall be amortized in nineteen annual installments, as determined by the actuary, payable or creditable over a period of twenty fiscal years following the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established, with payments or credits commencing with the second fiscal year succeeding the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established; or

         (C) that portion of a post-2010 UAL adjustment which is attributable to recently enacted changes in benefits which were not incorporated in the unfunded accrued liability established as of the preceding June thirtieth, as determined by the actuary, shall, unless an amortization period of a different length is specified by the law enacting such benefit changes, be payable or creditable in annual installments over a period of fiscal years comparable in length to the number of years which is one less than the number of years of the remaining working lifetimes of members covered by the benefit changes, as determined by the actuary, with the payment or credit of such annual installments commencing with the second fiscal year succeeding the June thirtieth as of which the unfunded accrued liability was established, provided, however, that where the length of the amortization period for the benefit changes is not specified in the law enacting the benefit changes, the actuary, in his or her discretion, and in lieu of amortizing the portion of the unfunded accrued liability attributable to the benefit changes over a period of fiscal years comparable in length to the number of years which is one less than the number of years of the remaining working lifetimes of members covered by the benefit changes, may select an amortization period that is reasonably consistent with past practice for amortizing unfunded accrued liability attributable to the particular type of benefit changes.

   (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, with respect to any installment of an unfunded accrued liability or an unfunded accrued liability adjustment, in the event that such retirement system has more than one responsible obligor, the actuary for that retirement system shall determine and shall allocate to each such responsible obligor its share of that installment, as determined to be appropriate by the actuary. Each responsible obligor's share of each such installment shall be either a charge or a credit with respect to such responsible obligor for the applicable fiscal year.

   (5) For each fiscal year, commencing with the two thousand eleven—two thousand twelve fiscal year, the actuary shall determine whether the sum of the charges and credits applicable to each responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to the applicable retirement system shall constitute a total charge or a total credit. Where such amount for such responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to such retirement system is a total charge, the responsible obligor shall pay an amount equal to such total charge to the retirement system in a timely manner, as required by paragraph six of this subdivision. Where such amount for such responsible obligor for such fiscal year with respect to such retirement system is a total credit, the amount of employer contributions otherwise payable by such responsible obligor to such retirement system for such fiscal year pursuant to applicable provisions of law, as determined by the actuary, shall be reduced by the amount of such total credit, provided, however, that such total amount of employer contributions otherwise payable by such responsible obligor to such retirement system for such fiscal year shall not be reduced below an amount equivalent to the amount payable by such responsible obligor for such fiscal year for administrative expenses, as determined by the actuary in accordance with the provisions of subdivision f of section 13-103 of this title for NYCERS, subdivision h of section 13-216 of this title for the PPF, subdivision d of section 13-518 of this title for the NYCTRS or paragraph (e) of subdivision twenty-three of section twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the education law for BERS, and shall not be reduced below zero for the FPF, provided further, that where a total credit for a responsible obligor with respect to a retirement system has been offset against employer contributions otherwise payable by such obligor to such retirement system for such fiscal year by the maximum amount permissible pursuant to the preceding provisions of this paragraph, and all or a portion of such credit remains after such offset, the remaining credit shall be carried forward, together with interest calculated on such amount at the valuation rate of interest, as a credit for such obligor for the following fiscal year, as determined by the actuary.

   (6) All responsible obligors shall make all unfunded accrued liability payments to a retirement system required pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision in accordance with the time of payment requirements set forth in subdivision c of section 13-133 of this title for NYCERS, subdivision c of section 13-231 of this title for the PPF, subdivision c of section 13-334 of this title for the FPF, subdivision (c) of section 13-533 of this title for the NYCTRS or paragraph (j) of subdivision sixteen of section twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the education law for BERS.

l. (1) In any case where the valuation rate of interest for a retirement system is changed by law for any period beginning on or after July first, two thousand four, and as of June thirtieth next preceding the fiscal year for which such change first becomes effective, there remain unpaid or uncredited, as the case may be, with respect to such retirement system, any installments of (i) the NYCERS 1999 UAL, (ii) the NYCTRS 1999 UAL, (iii) the BERS 1999 UAL, (iv) any post-June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-nine unfunded accrued liability adjustment (as defined in paragraph seventeen of subdivision a of this section), (v) any contribution to PPF referred to in subdivision p of section 13-638.3 of this subchapter (as added by chapter six hundred eight of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-one), (vi) any contribution to FPF referred to in subdivision p of section 13-638.3 of this subchapter (as added by chapter six hundred ten of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-one) or (vii) any other contribution by a responsible obligor to a retirement system (other than the normal contribution) which may be required by law for the purpose of funding any unfunded liability or funding deficiency of such retirement system, such remaining installments shall be recomputed by the actuary so that the present value of such recomputed installments, calculated as of such June thirtieth on the basis of such changed valuation rate, shall equal the present value of such remaining installments, calculated as of such June thirtieth on the basis of the valuation rate in effect immediately prior to such change.

   (2) In each fiscal year succeeding such June thirtieth, one of such recomputed installments shall be paid by or credited to, as the case may be, the responsible obligor or responsible obligors with respect to such retirement system in the same manner as the corresponding prior installments were paid or credited, until all such remaining installments are paid or credited in full; provided, however, that until all such installments are so disposed of, they shall be recomputed and paid or credited in recomputed form pursuant to this subdivision for each subsequent change in such valuation rate.

m. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all NYCERS, NYCTRS and BERS installments of the revised unfunded accrued liability contribution, the nineteen hundred eighty unfunded accrued liability adjustment, the nineteen hundred eighty-two unfunded accrued liability adjustment, the nineteen hundred eighty-five unfunded accrued liability adjustment, the nineteen hundred eighty-six unfunded accrued liability adjustment and the nineteen hundred eighty-eight unfunded accrued liability adjustment and all installments of the post June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine unfunded accrued liability adjustment established with respect to BERS pursuant to subdivision k of this section and all NYCERS, NYCTRS and BERS installments of amortization of bond sale gains and losses and all NYCERS, NYCTRS and BERS installments of funding of supplemental retirement allowances, which installments, in the absence of the enactment of chapter nine hundred forty-eight of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety and the act which first amended this subdivision, would otherwise be due from and payable by any responsible obligor to NYCERS, NYCTRS or BERS (or be creditable to such obligor) with respect to any fiscal year or period beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety (including all such NYCERS or NYCTRS installments attributable to the senior colleges as defined or referred to in subdivisions seven, eight, eight-a, eight-b, eight-c, eight-d, eight-e and eight-f of section sixty-two hundred two of the education law and subdivision one of section sixty-two hundred thirty-one of such law) are hereby cancelled as of such July first and shall not be due and payable (or creditable) on or after such July first.

n. The actuary of each retirement system undergoing consolidated UAL funding (as defined in paragraph twenty of subdivision a of this section) shall determine the amount of the difference obtained by subtracting (A) the outstanding balance, as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-five, of the nineteen hundred ninety balance sheet liability (as defined in paragraph thirty-five of subdivision a of this section) of such retirement system for (B) the outstanding balance, as of such June thirtieth, of the unfunded accrued liability as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety (as defined in paragraph thirty-four of subdivision a of this section) of such retirement system.

o. (1) From the amount of the difference determined pursuant to subdivision n of this section in relation to NYCERS, there shall be subtracted the portion thereof which is attributable to the senior colleges.

   (2) The actuary of NYCERS shall determine an amount which, when paid into the contingent reserve fund of NYCERS in fifteen equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the nineteen hundred ninety-five—nineteen hundred ninety-six fiscal year, shall be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of nine per centum interest per annum, of the remainder computed pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision.

   (2) Such amount determined in relation to such installments shall be payable in regular installments as provided for in subdivision bb of this section.

q. (1) From the amount of the difference determined pursuant to subdivision n of this section in relation to NYCTRS there shall be subtracted the amount thereof which is attributable to the senior colleges.

   (2) The actuary shall determine an amount which, when paid into the contingent reserve fund of NYCTRS in fifteen equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the nineteen hundred ninety-five—nineteen hundred ninety-six fiscal year, shall be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of nine per centum interest per annum, of the remainder computed pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision.

   (3) Such amount determined in relation to such installments shall be payable in regular installments as provided for in subdivision bb of this section.

r. (1) The actuary of NYCTRS shall determine an amount which, when paid by the state and the city into the contingent reserve fund of NYCTRS pursuant to section sixty-two hundred thirty-one of the education law in fifteen equal annual installments, commencing with payment of a first installment in the nineteen hundred ninety-five—nineteen hundred ninety-six fiscal year, shall be the actuarial equivalent, on the basis of nine per centum interest per annum, of the amount of difference attributable to the senior colleges, as determined pursuant to the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision q of this section in relation to NYCTRS.

In the case of a police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent who is entitled to receive an annual increased allowance (as defined in subdivision e of section 13-685 of this chapter) said supplemental pension shall be a percentage of such annual increased allowance and in the case of a police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent who is not entitled to receive an annual increased allowance, such supplemental pension shall be a percentage of the basic annual pension (as defined in subdivision d of such section 13-685), and in either case such percentage shall be determined on the basis of the consumer price index (all items-United States city average), published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics.

c. The supplemental pension shall be rounded off to the nearest dollar.

d. Such supplemental pension shall be payable to the same persons and shall be subject to the same terms and conditions, including provisions as to termination, as the basic pension awarded to the police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent.

e. (1) In any case where a police or fire line-of-duty spouse or dependent is entitled to receive an annual increased allowance, such police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent, if entitled to receive a supplemental pension under the provisions of this article six, shall be entitled to receive such supplemental pension under this article in addition to such annual increased allowance.

   (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph one of this subdivision e, the supplemental pension provided for by this article for any police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent shall be in lieu of any supplemental pension or supplemental retirement allowance for such police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent provided by any other law heretofore or hereafter enacted, unless such other supplemental pension or supplemental retirement allowance is in excess of that provided for by this article, in which latter case such other supplemental pension or supplemental retirement allowance shall be paid and no supplemental pension shall be paid under this article; provided however, that nothing contained in this subdivision e shall be construed as entitling any police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent to a supplemental retirement allowance under article two of subchapter six of chapter five of this title in any case where, if this article six had not been enacted, such police or fire line-of-duty surviving spouse or dependent would not be entitled to a supplemental retirement allowance under such article two.
