In the event that any site or plot of ground, transferred to the United States, for the erection and maintenance of a light and fog signal at Hunt's Point Park, in the borough of the Bronx, should become unnecessary or cease to be used for such purposes, such site shall revert to the city, as if such transfer had not been made.

In case the city should use any of such lands situate in the county of Westchester for purposes other than in this section permitted, or in case such land should not be required for the purpose of introducing water into the city, such lands so improperly used, or not so required, shall become vested in the individual from whom such city obtained it, as full and perfectly as though such act had never been enacted, upon repaying to the city the amount originally paid for the same, after deducting from such amount the damages sustained by such individual by reason of any alteration or work which the city may have made upon such land.

b. Such owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns or the department of citywide administrative services on behalf of such owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns shall apply, in writing, to the department of city planning for such conveyance either simultaneously with an application for the closing or discontinuance of a street or not later than two years after the acquisition of such private street or not later than two years after the closing or discontinuance of such closed or discontinued street. The department of city planning shall process such application pursuant to sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and one hundred ninety-seven-d of the charter. The department of city planning shall notify or cause to be notified all other owners eligible to purchase such right, title or interest pursuant to the provisions of this section of the filing of such application prior to certifying that such application is complete.

Failure by the department to give such notice or cause such notice to be given shall not invalidate any proceedings with respect to such application.

d. Subject to the provisions of section three hundred eighty-four of the charter, the mayor may at any time sell or otherwise dispose of the right, title and interest of the city in and to so much of the land lying within such private or such closed or discontinued street for which no application has been filed pursuant to this section, to any person or persons whomsoever upon such terms and conditions as the mayor may deem proper.
