*§ 4-101 Acquisition of certain lands; by reversion.* ::


In the event that any site or plot of ground, transferred to the United States, for the erection and maintenance of a light and fog signal at Hunt's Point Park, in the borough of the Bronx, should become unnecessary or cease to be used for such purposes, such site shall revert to the city, as if such transfer had not been made.

The lands situate in the county of Westchester which were taken by the city, by virtue of the act entitled "An act to provide for supplying the city of New York with pure and wholesome water" passed May second, eighteen hundred thirty-four, shall be held and appropriated by the city for the use and purpose of introducing water into the city, and for purposes necessarily incident thereto, and for no other uses or purposes whatever. In case the city should use any of such lands situate in the county of Westchester for purposes other than in this section permitted, or in case such land should not be required for the purpose of introducing water into the city, such lands so improperly used, or not so required, shall become vested in the individual from whom such city obtained it, as full and perfectly as though such act had never been enacted, upon repaying to the city the amount originally paid for the same, after deducting from such amount the damages sustained by such individual by reason of any alteration or work which the city may have made upon such land.

b.

b. Such owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns or the department of citywide administrative services on behalf of such owner or owners or owner's heirs or assigns shall apply, in writing, to the department of city planning for such conveyance either simultaneously with an application for the closing or discontinuance of a street or not later than two years after the acquisition of such private street or not later than two years after the closing or discontinuance of such closed or discontinued street. The department of city planning shall process such application pursuant to sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and one hundred ninety-seven-d of the charter. The department of city planning shall notify or cause to be notified all other owners eligible to purchase such right, title or interest pursuant to the provisions of this section of the filing of such application prior to certifying that such application is complete. Such notice shall be served by registered or certified mail addressed to the last known address of such owner or owners, as the same appears in the records of the office of the commissioner of finance or if there is no name in such records, such notice may be served by ordinary mail addressed to "Owner" at the street address of the improvement parcel or property in question. Failure by the department to give such notice or cause such notice to be given shall not invalidate any proceedings with respect to such application.

d. Subject to the provisions of section three hundred eighty-four of the charter, the mayor may at any time sell or otherwise dispose of the right, title and interest of the city in and to so much of the land lying within such private or such closed or discontinued street for which no application has been filed pursuant to this section, to any person or persons whomsoever upon such terms and conditions as the mayor may deem proper.

e. The provisions of this section which refer to land or lands lying within a private street or within a street closed or discontinued shall be deemed to refer to the surface and subsurface of and air space over such street or any part of the surface or subsurface of or the air space over such street.

Upon the sale or lease of real property belonging to the city as herein provided, if such real property shall be sold or leased to a purchaser or lessee procured by a broker and the purchase price or rental accepted by the city upon the consummation of the sale or lease shall equal or exceed the offer made by such broker in behalf of the purchaser or lessee, the city is hereby authorized to pay the usual commissions to such broker.

   5. Report to the board whether or not it is in the public interest to grant permission to the lessee or assignee of a lease made by the city for a term of one year or longer, to assign the same or to underlet the demised premises notwithstanding any provision in the lease to the contrary.

Preserve in a book to be kept in the commissioner's office for that purpose, to be called the "record of quit-rents", maps of all grants of land heretofore made by the city, on which quit-rents are payable, showing the original grants and subdivisions thereof as definitely as these can be ascertained. The commissioner shall receive the sums proportionately due from each owner in payment of the portion of the moneys payable under the original grant, as such sums, from time to time, shall become payable and shall likewise receive any commuted quit-rents paid as hereinafter provided. The commissioner of citywide administrative services, on receiving written notice from the grantee of the city, or his or her assignee, of the sale of any portion of land subject to quit-rent, shall enter in the record of quit-rents the name of the purchaser, the date of the sale, and the portion of the land sold. The commissioner thereafter shall receive the sum proportionately due from such purchaser in payment of his or her portion of the moneys payable under the original grant, as the same, from time to time, shall become payable, and the commissioner shall receive from the owner of the lot or parcel mentioned in the notice, or the owner's legal representative, the sum proportionately due from the owner in payment of his or her proportion of the moneys payable under the original grant. When land heretofore granted by the city, subject to a quit-rent, portions of which have been assigned by the grantee, shall be re-entered by the city for nonpayment of the quit-rent, the commissioner may grant releases in severalty to such of the assignees of portions of the land granted as shall, within six months from the re-entry, pay to the commissioner their respective apportionments of commutation money and the expenses of re-entry and conveyance, with such portions of the rent as may be justly due from the respective assignees for the land held by them, as the same shall be apportioned by the commissioner. Whenever any person shall desire to commute any quit-rent due the city, the commissioner shall calculate such commutation at the rate of six per cent and, upon the production of evidence that such quit-rent and all arrears of rent have been paid into the treasury of the city to the credit of the real property fund, the mayor and city clerk shall execute a release of such quit-rent. All sums received by the commissioner pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall be paid daily to the commissioner of finance.

   7. Upon the payment in full of the principal and interest due on any bond and mortgage held by the city, the mayor and city clerk shall execute, under their hands and the seal of the city, upon evidence being exhibited to them showing that the principal and interest on such bond and mortgage have been paid into the treasury of the city to the credit of the appropriate fund an assignment or proper satisfaction of said bond and mortgage. The release by such officials of any part of the premises described in such mortgage from the lien created by such mortgage is prohibited.

   8. Keep on file in the department of citywide administrative services all title deeds, leases, bonds, mortgages, or other assurances of title, except as otherwise provided by law.

   9. Record all grants, leases and counter-parts of leases, and all deeds executed by the city in proper books. The commissioner shall also keep a record of all property owned and acquired by the city. Such record shall show the date the property was acquired, the tax map description thereof, the borough in which the property is located, and shall be properly cross indexed with reference to the original deeds of acquisition. The commissioner shall also keep a record of all property on which rent is in arrears and the amounts of the arrearages.
