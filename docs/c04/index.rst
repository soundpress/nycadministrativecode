c. In case a separate and partial final decree or decrees as to damage, including part of the real property being acquired in the proceeding, shall have been made or filed therein and the justice who made and filed the separate and partial final decree or decrees as to damage shall have died or retired from the bench, or become incapacitated for any reason, the corporation counsel and the court shall proceed with the ascertainment and determination of damage with relation to the remaining real property damaged in the same manner as provided for the ascertainment and determination of damage with relation to the entire real property being acquired and shall make a separate and partial tentative and final decree as to damage as to all the real property being acquired in the proceeding, which shall not have been included in prior separate and partial final decrees as to damage. All provisions of this subchapter relating to tentative and final decrees shall apply to the separate and partial final decrees as to damage so made, provided, however, that the provision making it the duty of the justice to view the property being acquired shall not apply in case the buildings or improvements on the property or the part thereof being acquired shall have been removed or destroyed by the city or pursuant to its authority prior to the time the matter shall have been assigned to such justice for trial.

b. After the filing of the tentative decree or of any new, or supplemental, or amended tentative decree, no award for damages shall be diminished without notice to the owner of the real property affected or the owner's attorney appearing in the proceeding and an opportunity given for a hearing in regard thereto before signing the final decree.

The final decree shall also set forth the names of the respective owners of the several parcels acquired, but in all cases where the owners are unknown or not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient to set forth and state in general terms in the decree the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners of the respective parcels for loss and damage without specifying their names or their estates or interests therein, and in such case the owners may be specified as unknown.

b. To the final decree shall be attached the surveys, diagrams, maps or plans referred to in subdivision a of section 5-315 of this subchapter, duly corrected, when necessary. Such decree shall set forth the several parcels taken by reference to the numbers of such parcels on the respective surveys, diagrams, maps or plans, and it shall not be necessary to describe any parcels acquired by metes and bounds.

c. Should any errors exist in the tentative decree, or in the surveys, diagrams, maps or plans attached thereto, or should there occur, between the date of the tentative decree and the time of the signing by the court of the final decree, any changes in ownership resulting in changes in the size of area, by subdivision or otherwise, of any of the parcels of any real property to be acquired, the court may alter and correct the respective surveys, diagrams, maps or plans to show such changes in such final decree. At the time of the entry of the final decree, the court shall direct that the maps furnished to the corporation counsel in the proceeding shall be revised and altered in agreement with the tax maps as of the date of the entry of such decree.






*§ 5-322 Filing of final decree as to damage where objections and the filing of a tentative decree are waived.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, in any case where the owner of any real property affected by any proceeding under this subchapter or the owner's attorney and the corporation counsel enter into an agreement in writing whereby it is agreed that with respect to the award of damages in relation to such property, the filing of a tentative decree, the giving of notice to file objections and the filing and hearing of objections are waived, the filing of a tentative decree, the giving of such notice and the hearing of objections in relation to such award shall not be required.

b. In a capital project proceeding, the court may make a separate and partial final decree or decrees determining the final awards to any owners of real property affected by the proceeding who have entered into such waiver agreements or in whose behalf such agreements have been made by their attorneys, or where such agreements have been so entered into by or in behalf of all owners of real property affected by such proceeding, the court may make a final decree determining the final awards to such owners. In accordance with the procedure regularly governing where the provisions of subdivision a of this section are not applicable, the court may make such separate and partial tentative or final or other decrees as may be appropriate for the determination of awards to owners of real property affected by the proceeding who have not entered into such agreements and in whose behalf such agreements have not been made by their attorneys.

c. 1. Any separate and partial final decree or final decree determining final awards to owners of real property by whom or in whose behalf such waiver agreements have been so entered into shall be prepared by the corporation counsel in accordance with the instructions of the justice trying the proceeding, and shall set forth the following:

      (a) such awards, as determined by the court, set opposite the respective damage parcel numbers;

      (b) the facts conferring jurisdiction over the proceeding upon the court and such other matters as the court shall require to be included;

      (c) a statement that the amounts set opposite the respective damage parcel numbers constitute and are just compensation which the respective owners are entitled to receive from the city; and

      (d) the names of the respective owners of the several parcels acquired, as far as the same shall have been ascertained, but in all cases where the owners are unknown or not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient to set forth and state in general terms in the decree the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners of the respective parcels for loss and damage, without specifying their names or their estates or interests therein, and in such case the owners may be specified as unknown.

   2. If any such decree is the first separate and partial final decree or final decree filed in such proceeding, there shall be attached thereto the surveys, diagrams, maps or plans referred to in subdivision a of section 5-315 of this subchapter, duly corrected, when necessary. Any such decree referred to in this subdivision shall set forth the several parcels taken by reference to the numbers of such parcels on the respective surveys, diagrams, maps, or plans, and it shall not be necessary to describe any parcels acquired by metes and bounds.






*§ 5-323 Final decree; how filed; effect.* ::


a. The final decree, together with all affidavits and proofs upon which the same is based, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the order granting the application to condemn was filed, and a certified copy of such decree shall be filed in the office in which instruments affecting real property are required to be recorded, in every county in which any part of the real property affected is situated and shall be filed in the department of citywide administrative services of the city of New York.

b. The final decree, unless set aside or reversed on appeal, shall be final and conclusive as well upon the city as upon the owners of the real property mentioned therein, and also upon all other persons whomsoever.






*§ 5-324 Appeal to appellate division.* ::


The city or any party or person affected by the proceeding and aggrieved by the final decree of the court therein as to awards may appeal to the appellate division of the court. An appeal from the final decree of the court must be taken within thirty days after notice of the filing of such final decree. Except as herein otherwise provided, such appeal shall be taken and heard in the manner provided by the civil practice law and rules and the rules and practice of the court in relation to appeals from orders in special proceedings, and such appeal shall be heard and determined by such appellate division upon the merits both as to matters of law and fact. The determination of the appellate division shall be in the form of an order. The taking of an appeal by any person or persons shall not operate to stay the proceedings under this subchapter except as to the particular parcel of real property with which the appeal is concerned. The final decree of the court shall be deemed to be final and conclusive upon all parties and persons affected thereby, who have not appealed. Such appeal shall be heard upon the evidence taken by the court or such part or portion thereof as the justice who made the decree may certify, or the parties to such appeal may agree upon as sufficient to present the merits of the questions in respect to which such appeal shall be had. An appeal taken but not prosecuted within six months after the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the time within which to prosecute the same shall have been extended by an order of the court, shall be deemed to have been abandoned and no agreement between the parties extending the time within which such appeal may be prosecuted shall vary the provisions hereof. When a final decree of the court shall be reversed on appeal, such reversal shall not divest the city of title to the real property affected by the appeal.






*§ 5-325 Appeal to court of appeals.* ::


An appeal to the court of appeals may be taken by the city or any person or party interested in the proceeding and aggrieved by the order of the appellate division. Such appeal shall be taken and heard in the manner provided by the civil practice law and rules and the rules and practice of the court of appeals in relation to appeals from orders in special proceedings. An appeal taken but not prosecuted within six months after the filing of the notice of appeal, unless the time within which to prosecute the same shall have been extended by an order of the court, shall be deemed to be abandoned, and no agreement between the parties to the appeal extending the time to prosecute the same shall vary the provisions hereof. The court of appeals may affirm or reverse the order appealed from, and may make such order or direction as shall be appropriate to the case. If the final decree or decrees of the court shall be reversed by the court of appeals, such reversal shall not divest the city of title to the real property affected by the appeal.






*§ 5-326 Taxation of costs, charges and expenses.* ::


a. The bill of the reasonable and necessary costs, charges and expenses which by law are required to be taxed shall not be paid or allowed until they shall have been taxed by the court after notice given as in this section provided. Upon such taxation, due proof of the nature and extent of the services rendered and the disbursements charged shall be furnished, and no unnecessary costs or charges shall be allowed. All items in the bill shall be stated in detail and shall be accompanied by such proof of the reasonableness thereof and the necessity therefor, as is now required by law and the practice of the court upon taxation of costs and disbursements in other special proceedings or actions in such court. Proof by affidavit shall also be given of the dates of rendering services. No such claim for compensation, in a capital project proceeding, shall be allowed or paid unless it be accompanied by a certificate of the comptroller setting forth that the same has been audited and examined, and further certifying the result of such audit and examination. Such certificate shall be presumptive evidence of the correctness, reasonableness and necessity of such bill.

b. In a capital project proceeding, the corporation counsel shall be given five days' notice of the taxation of the bill of costs, charges and expenses.

c. Property owners appearing in the proceedings shall not be entitled to recover counsel fees, costs, disbursements or allowances, except as provided in sections seven hundred one and seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law.






*§ 5-327 Damages; when, how and to whom paid.* ::


a. All damages awarded by the court, with interest thereon from the date title to the real property acquired shall have vested in the city and all costs, charges and expenses which may have been taxed shall be paid by the city to the respective owners mentioned or referred to in the final decree or to the persons in whose favor such costs, charges and expenses were taxed, as hereinafter provided.

b. In a capital project proceeding, payment shall be made within two calendar months after the entry of the final decree. In default of such payment, the owners or other persons entitled to be paid in the proceeding may at any time after application first made to the comptroller therefor, sue for and recover the amount due, with lawful interest, and the costs of such suit. Upon the application to the comptroller for payment, the applicant may state that any outstanding taxes, assessments or other liens may be deducted from the amount otherwise payable, and in that event, the fact that there are outstanding taxes, assessments or other liens shall not impair or invalidate such application nor operate as a bar to the collection of interest upon the amount awarded less the amount of such outstanding taxes, assessments or other liens.

c. Payment of an award to a person named in the final decree as the owner thereof, if not under legal disability, shall in the absence of notice in writing to the comptroller of adverse claims thereto, protect the city.

d. Where an award shall be paid to a person not entitled thereto, the person to whom it ought to have been paid may sue for and recover such award, with lawful interest and costs of suit, as so much money had and received to his or her use by the person to whom the same shall have been paid.

e. 1. When an owner in whose favor an award shall have been made in a final decree, shall be under legal disability or absent from the city, and when the name of the owner shall not be set forth or mentioned in the final decree or when the owner, although named in such decree, cannot, upon diligent inquiry, be found, or where there are adverse or conflicting claims to the money awarded as compensation, the city shall pay such award into the supreme court, to be secured, disposed of, invested or paid out as such court shall direct, and such payment shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made to the owner or other person entitled thereto.

   2. In default of such payment into court, the city shall be and remain liable for such award, with lawful interest thereon from the date upon which title to the real property for which said award was made vested in the city, in a capital project proceeding.






*§ 5-328 Advance payments.* ::


The mayor may authorize the comptroller to pay to the person entitled to an award for real property acquired in a proceeding, in advance of the final determination of such person's damages pursuant to the requirements of article three of the eminent domain procedure law, a sum to be determined by the corporation counsel, after an appraisal of the damages sustained by such person by the expert or experts employed by the corporation counsel less any liens or encumbrances of record upon such property, which amount shall be certified to the comptroller by the corporation counsel. The mayor shall authorize the comptroller to cause to be published in the City Record for ten consecutive days a notice stating that the comptroller is ready to pay such persons entitled to awards for real property acquired in such proceed-ing, in advance of the final determination of their damage. Such notice shall describe the property for which such advance payment may be made by tax block and lot numbers or the damage parcel numbers of the real property involved. Before any such advance payment shall be made, the comptroller shall procure the certificate of the corporation counsel showing the amount to be paid to the claimant, that said amount does represent one hundred percent of the city's appraised valuation and that the person to whom payment is to be made is the person legally entitled to receive the same. In case the person entitled to an award at the date of the vesting of title to the real property in the city shall have transferred or assigned his or her claim, such transfer or assignment made by such person, or by his or her successor in interest or legal representative, shall not become binding upon the city unless the instrument or instruments evidencing such transfer or assignment shall have been executed and filed in the office of the comptroller prior to any such advance payment. When any such advance payment shall have been made, the comptroller, on paying the awards made for the real property acquired, shall deduct from the total amount allowed as compensation the sum advanced plus interest thereon from the date of the payment of such advance to the date of the final decree and the balance shall be paid as provided in section 5-327 of this subchapter.






*§ 5-329 Purchase of awards by the city.* ::


a. In any proceedings instituted pursuant to any of the provisions of this subchapter, or pursuant to the provisions of any other statute providing for the acquisition of title to real property by the city, in which title thereto shall have become vested in such city prior to the entry of the final decree of the court, the mayor shall have power and is hereby authorized to purchase or to approve the purchase on behalf of the city from the individuals or corporations who were the owners of such real property at the date of the vesting of title thereto, or their successors in interest or legal representatives, their right and title to the award or awards, or any part thereof, to be made in such proceeding and to take an assignment thereof to the city. If such owner or owners or their successors in interest or legal representatives shall have transferred or assigned such claim, such transfer or assignment made by such owner or owners or by their successors in interest or legal representatives shall not become binding upon the city unless the instrument or instruments evidencing such transfer or assignment shall have been executed and filed in the office of the comptroller as provided in section 5-330 of this subchapter, prior to the completion of such purchase by the city.

b. An option granted to the city to purchase such award or awards for a period not to exceed six months shall not be withdrawn or cancelled during the period named therein.






*§ 5-330 Instruments assigning or pledging awards.* ::


In case of the pledge, sale, transfer or assignment of an award by the person entitled to receive the same by virtue of the final decree of the court, or by other order of the court, the instrument evidencing such pledge, sale, transfer or assignment, acknowledged or proved as instruments are required to be acknowledged or proved for the recording of transfers of real property, shall be filed in the office of the comptroller, who shall endorse on such instrument its number and the hour, day, month and year of its receipt. If an assignment of an award be contained in an instrument recorded in an office in which instruments affecting real property are by law required to be recorded, a certified copy thereof may be filed in the office of the comptroller in place of the original. An alphabetical index shall be kept under the names of the pledgor or assignor, and of the pledgee or assignee, stating the title of the proceeding, the time of the filing of the instrument, the file number thereof, and what part of the award is assigned thereby. A memorandum of the file number of the instrument shall be made by the comptroller on the duplicate decree of the court opposite the place where the amount of the award so assigned is set forth. Every such instrument not so filed shall be void as against any subsequent pledgee or assignee in good faith and for a valuable consideration from the same pledgor or assignor, his or her heirs, administrators or assigns, of the same award or any portion thereof, the assignment of which is first duly filed in the office of the comptroller. Payment to the assignee or pledgee shown to be entitled to the award by such record in the office of the comptroller shall protect the city from liability to any other person or persons.






*§ 5-331 Correction of defects.* ::


The court at any time may correct any defect or informality in any notice, petition, pleading, order or decree in the proceeding, or cause real property affected by such defect, informality or lack of jurisdiction to be excluded therefrom, or other real property affected by such defect, informality or lack of jurisdiction to be included therein by amendment, upon ten days' notice, published and posted as provided for the institution of the proceeding, and may direct such further notices to be given to any party in interest as it shall deem proper.






*§ 5-332 Order to expedite proceeding.* ::


At any time after the date of entry of the order granting the application to condemn, the corporation counsel, or any owner may apply to the court for an order directing any owner or owners, or the corporation counsel, as the case may be, to show cause why further proceedings under this subchapter on the part of such owner or owners or of the corporation counsel should not be expedited. Upon the hearing directed by such order to show cause, the court in its discretion may make an order directing that such proceedings be expedited in the manner stated therein and also making such further directions with respect to the particulars shown upon the application as shall be just and proper in the premises.






*§ 5-333 Discontinuance of proceedings by the mayor.* ::


The mayor may effect a discontinuance of any proceeding as to the whole or a part of the lands to be acquired in such proceeding, at any time before title to the real property to be thereby acquired shall have vested in the city, and may cause new proceedings to be taken for the condemnation of such real property. In case of such discontinuance, however, the city shall adhere to the provisions of section seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law and the reasonable actual cash disbursements, necessarily incurred and made in good faith by any party interested, shall be paid by the city, after the same shall have been taxed by a justice of the supreme court, upon ten days' notice of such taxation being previously given to the corporation counsel, provided the application to have such disbursements taxed shall be made and presented to the court within one year after the action of the mayor. For the purposes of this section, the fair and reasonable value of the services of an attorney retained by any interested party to represent such party's interests in said condemnation proceedings, whether on a contingent fee basis or otherwise, if such retainer be made in good faith, shall be deemed to be an actual cash disbursement, necessarily incurred by such interested party and shall be taxable in the same manner as other disbursements. The amounts taxed as disbursements shall be due and payable thirty days after written demand for payment thereof shall have been filed with the comptroller.






*§ 5-334 Vesting of title; date of; seizin*; possession.* ::


a. The title to any piece or parcel of the real property authorized to be acquired hereunder for any public improvement or for any public purpose shall be vested in the city upon the entry of the order granting the application to condemn, in a capital project proceeding, in accordance with section four hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law.

b. Upon the date when title to the real property shall have vested as provided in subdivision a of this section, the city, in a capital project proceeding shall become and be seized in fee of or of an easement in, over, upon, or under such real property as the mayor may have determined, the same to be held, appropriated, converted and used for the purposes for which the proceeding was instituted.

c. The city or any person acting under its authority, or the agency which upon the acquisition of title to such real property will have jurisdiction thereof, shall immediately or any time thereafter take possession of such property without suit or other judicial proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the eminent domain procedure law pertaining to possession.






*§ 5-335 Vesting of title; effect of, upon real property contracts.* ::


a. Where the whole of any lot or parcel of real property, under lease or other contract, shall be taken, all the covenants, contracts and engagements between landlord and tenant or any other contracting parties touching the same, or any part thereof, upon the vesting of title in the city, shall cease and determine and be absolutely discharged. Where part only of any lot or parcel of real property so under lease or other contract shall be so taken, all contracts and engagements respecting the same, upon such vesting of title, shall cease and determine and be absolutely discharged, as to the part thereof so taken, but shall remain valid and obligatory as to the residue thereof.

b. All persons in possession of such premises at the time of the vesting of title thereto in the city, shall at the option of the city become tenants at will of such city and shall, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing, pay the same rent in effect immediately prior to vesting of title or unless within ten days after the vesting of title they shall elect to vacate and give up their respective holdings.

c. Where a person or persons in possession of the premises at the time of vesting of title thereto are the owners thereof, such person or persons shall at the option of the city become tenants at will of such city, unless within ten days after the vesting of title they shall elect to vacate and give up their holdings. Where such person or persons fail to vacate and give up their holdings, and become tenants at will of the city as herein provided, such person or persons shall pay the reasonable value for the use and occupancy of the premises.

d. Where a person in possession is entitled to an award in such proceeding the rental as provided in subdivision b and the sum fixed for use and occupation as provided in subdivision c herein, during the period between the date of vesting of title in the city and the date of the actual payment of the award, shall be a lien against such award, subject only to liens of record at the time of the vesting of title in the city.






*§ 5-336 Rights of certain owners of property condemned for public use.* ::


1. Notwithstanding any general, special or local law to the contrary, where rent is paid for the use of land on which a one or two family dwelling has been constructed, in the event of condemnation for public use a separate award shall be made to the owner of the land and a separate award shall be made to the owner of the dwelling except where there is a written agreement to the contrary.

2. In no event shall the total of the awards, as above, be in excess of what a single award would have been.






*§ 5-337 Title acquired for streets and courtyards.* ::


a. The title acquired in real property required for any streets shall be kept in trust, that the same be appropriated and kept open for, or as part of a public street, forever, in like manner as the other streets in the city are and of right ought to be.

b. The mayor, at the time of authorizing the proceedings in which lands are to be acquired for courtyard purposes, may determine whether the fee or an easement shall be acquired in lands required therefor, and the mayor may prescribe such conditions and limitations on the title so to be acquired and as to the temporary or permanent use of the land so to be acquired as he or she may deem proper. The title which the city shall acquire to the lands required for courtyard purposes shall be such as the mayor shall determine. Such title shall be held by the city subject to such limitations and conditions as to title thereto, or as to the use thereof, as the mayor shall prescribe. If not inconsistent with such limitations and conditions as to title or as to the use, land acquired for courtyard purposes may be devoted to general street uses whenever the board of estimate shall determine that the public interest requires such use.

c. The title in fee acquired by the city to real property, except for street and courtyard purposes, shall be a fee simple absolute.






*§ 5-338 Title acquired for streets; subject to certain easements.* ::


If any individual or corporation, before the entry of the order granting the application to condemn, has acquired any easement for the purpose of laying or maintaining in the real property to be acquired for street purposes in a proceeding pursuant to this subchapter, underground pipes or conduits for the distribution of water, gas, steam or electricity, or for pneumatic service, such easement shall not be extinguished, but the title to the real property so to be acquired for the purposes authorized shall be taken subject to such easement; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to limit the power of the city to acquire by purchase or by condemnation proceedings the entire plant or service of such individual or corporation, or to acquire such easement in such street in any other appropriate proceedings.






*§ 5-339 Title acquired for streets; subject to rights of railroads.* ::


The city may acquire for street purposes title in fee or to an easement, as may be determined by the mayor to any real property heretofore acquired through purchase or condemnation by any railroad corporation in the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens for its corporate purposes and which real property lies within the lines of, is adjacent to, adjoins or separates any street or any part or parts thereof, now or hereafter laid out upon the city map, where the state commissioner of transportation certifies that the ownership or exclusive use of such real property or easement thereover is no longer necessary to the carrying out of such corporate purposes. Such title or easement, however, shall be acquired by the city subject to the right of the corporation to continue to use such real property during the term of its corporate existence and for its corporate purposes, or in lieu thereof to use for a like term and like purposes such other portion of the streets within which such real property shall lie, as the public service commission shall designate.






*§ 5-340 Title acquired for intercepting sewer purposes; over railroad lands.* ::


Notwithstanding any provisions of the railroad law or of any other statute, general or special, the city is hereby authorized and empowered to acquire title in fee or to a permanent or temporary easement, as may be determined by the mayor, in, under, through, over and across the lands of any railroad company, in any borough of the city, necessary to construct and maintain an intercepting sewer and the appurtenances thereunto appertaining, including grit chambers, in any such borough.







**Subchapter 2: Excess Lands Acquisition Procedure**



*§ 5-341 Definitions.* ::


As used in this subchapter, unless otherwise expressly stated, or unless the context or subject matter otherwise requires, the following terms shall mean:

1. "Improvement": The laying out, widening, extending or relocating a park, public place, highway or street, or the acquisition of title to real property required for laying out, widening, extending or relocating a park, public place, highway or street.

2. "Excess lands", or "additional lands", or "additional real property": The real property in addition to the real property needed or required for laying out, widening, extending or relocating a park, public place, highway or street.






*§ 5-342 Construction.* ::


The provisions of this subchapter shall be construed as supplementing and extending the effect of the provisions of subchapter one of this chapter so as to provide for the acquisition of title to additional lands in connection with an improvement and nothing in this subchapter contained shall be construed as limiting the effect of the provisions of such subchapter one in their application to the acquisition of title to real property required for an improvement when acquired in a proceeding in which additional lands shall or shall not be acquired, except as the provisions of such subchapter one are in this subchapter expressly so limited in their application.






*§ 5-343 Power to condemn excess lands.* ::


The city, in acquiring real property for any improvement, may acquire more real property than is needed for the actual construction of the improvement. The mayor may authorize the city to acquire additional real property in connection with any improvement, and direct that the same be acquired with the real property to be acquired for the improvement. Such additional real property, however, shall be not more than sufficient to form suitable building sites abutting on the improvement. The title which the city shall acquire to additional real property shall in every case be a fee simple absolute. Additional real property shall be acquired by the city in connection with a street improvement only when the title acquired for the improvement shall be in fee. When the mayor shall have authorized the acquisition of title to additional real property in connection with an improvement, title to such additional real property shall be acquired by the city in the manner and according to the procedure, except in such respects as in this subchapter set forth, provided for the acquisition of title to the real property required for the improvement and in the same proceeding in which title to the real property required for the improvement shall be acquired; except further that such acquisition shall be made in compliance with the appropriate provisions of the eminent domain procedure law.






*§ 5-344 Amendment of improvement proceeding to include or exclude excess lands.* ::


After the institution of a proceeding for an improvement, the mayor may amend the proceeding by authorizing the acquisition of lands additional to those required for the improvement, provided that title shall not have vested in the city to any parcel of real property to be acquired for the improvement within the block, between legally existing public streets, embracing the additional lands sought to be acquired. The mayor may also amend any proceeding so as to exclude any or all additional lands being acquired in the proceeding, provided title to such additional lands shall not have vested in the city. Thereafter the proceeding shall be conducted in the same manner as if the additional lands included or excluded by the amendment had been included or had not been included in the proceeding at the time of the institution thereof.






*§ 5-345 Damage maps to be prepared.* ::


When the mayor shall authorize the acquisition of additional real property in connection with any improvement, the mayor shall cause to be prepared and shall approve a map showing the real property to be acquired for the improvement and such additional real property in connection with the real property to be acquired for the improvement, and such map shall be filed, prior to the application to condemn the same, as follows: One copy thereof in the office in which conveyances of real property are required by law to be recorded in each county in which the real property or any part thereof shown on such map is situated; one copy thereof in the office of the corporation counsel; one copy thereof in the office of the president of each borough in which the real property or any part thereof shown on such map is situated; and one copy thereof in the office of the mayor.






*§ 5-346 Petition and notice.* ::


When the mayor shall have authorized the acquisition of additional real property in connection with any improvement, such additional real property shall be separately described in the notice of application to condemn by the supreme court and in the petition presented on any such application, and separately shown on the rule map attached to the petition and on the damage map in the proceeding, and such notice and petition shall state what part of the real property to be condemned is required for the improvement, and what part thereof is to be acquired as additional real property. The acquisition of such additional real property, when authorized by the mayor, shall be deemed to be for a public purpose.






*§ 5-347 Vesting of title; seizin*; possession.* ::


a. In a proceeding in which additional real property shall be acquired, the mayor shall direct that on the date of entry of the order granting the application to acquire by the supreme court the title to the whole but not less than the whole of such additional real property to be acquired in the proceeding shall vest in the city. Such order shall also direct the vesting in such city, simultaneously, of the title to all of the real property being acquired in the proceeding for the improvement. In a proceeding involving the acquisition of title to additional real property required for a street, highway or public place, however, the mayor shall not be required to vest, at one time, the title to all the additional real property to be acquired, provided that:

   1. In vesting title to parts of such additional real property every such part shall be of at least a block length along the improvement, and no fractional portion of a block shall be contained in any such part, and

   2. The mayor shall also direct that all the real property required for the street, highway or public place in such block or blocks shall vest in the city simultaneously.

b. Upon the date of the entry of the order granting the application to acquire, the city shall be and become seized in fee simple absolute to such additional real property. The reversal on appeal of the final decree, or of any part thereof, shall not operate to divest the city of title to any of the real property so acquired. In a proceeding in which excess lands shall be acquired, the mayor shall not have power to direct the vesting of title in the city to the real property required for the improvement without also directing the vesting of title in the city, simultaneously, to the excess lands being acquired in the proceeding in connection with the improvement, except that the mayor may direct, in the manner provided in subdivision a of this section, that title to the real property required for a street, highway or public place shall vest in the city in any block of such street, highway or public place abutting which no excess lands are taken.

c. In any proceeding in which excess lands shall be acquired, when title to any part less than the whole of the real property required for the street, highway or public place in any one block thereof, between legally existing public streets, shall vest in the city, title to the remainder of the real property required for the street, highway or public place in the same block and title to the additional lands to be acquired in the proceeding abutting on the street, highway or public place in the same block, shall vest in the city simultaneously. The reversal on appeal of the final decree of the court, or of any part thereof, shall not operate to divest the city of title to any of the real property so acquired for the street, highway or public place in the same block or to the additional lands abutting thereon.

d. Upon the vesting of title, as in this section provided, to any such additional lands and to lands required for the improvement, the city, or any person acting under its authority, may immediately, or at any time thereafter, take possession of the additional lands so vested and of the real property required for the improvement so vested, or any part or parts thereof, in accordance with the provisions of the eminent domain procedure law pertaining to possession.






*§ 5-348 Ascertainment of damages where part of parcel is taken for an improvement and remainder as excess lands.* ::


a. Where part of a parcel of real property shall be acquired for an improvement, and the remainder or a portion of the remainder of such parcel in the same ownership shall be acquired in the same proceeding as excess lands, the portion of the damages due to the acquisition of the real property required for the improvement shall be determined and stated separately from the entire damage due to each such owner. In determining the damages due to the acquisition of so much of such parcel as may be required for the improvement, the same rule shall be applied as would govern the determination of damages for the taking of the real property required for the improvement in case no excess lands were acquired. Where part of a parcel of real property shall be acquired for the improvement, and the remainder or a portion of the remainder thereof in the same ownership shall be acquired in the same proceeding as excess lands, the damages due to the acquisition of title to the real property required for the improvement, shall, in every case, equal the amount which would be awarded to such owner in case only that part of his or her real property, which shall be required for the improvement, were acquired.

b. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to authorize the award to an owner, part of whose real property is taken for the improvement, and the remainder or a portion of the remainder of whose property is taken as additional lands, any greater amount of compensation than such owner shall be entiled to by reason of the taking of his or her real property for the improvement and as additional lands, considered together as one parcel.

Before any conveyance or release authorized by this subchapter shall be executed, the terms on which the same shall be executed shall be reported to the court on oath, and if the court shall be satisfied that such terms are just to the party interested in such rights, titles, interests, or properties, the court shall confirm the report and direct to be executed the proper conveyance or release, which shall have the same effect as if executed by an owner of such rights, titles, interests or properties having legal power to sell, surrender, and convey the same.

In case any person owning private property not actually taken or proposed to be taken, pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, but which will in such person's opinion be damaged, the commissioner representing the city, with the approval of the mayor, may agree with such person as to the amount of such damages, and if such agreement cannot be made, such damages, if any, shall be determined in the same manner provided for ascertaining and determining the value of real estate taken under such proceedings, and the amount of such damages so agreed upon or so determined shall be payable and collectible in the same manner as is provided in the case of awards made in such proceedings.

Upon such application the corporation counsel shall in addition to the other requirements of section four hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law, present to the court a petition, signed and verified by the commissioner, setting forth the action theretofore taken by such commissioner and the mayor, and the filing of such maps. Such petition shall contain a general description of all the real estate to, in or over which any title, interest, right or easement is sought to be acquired for the city for the purposes of this subchapter, each parcel being more particularly described by a reference to the number of such parcel, as given on such map, and the title, interest or easement sought to be acquired to, in or over such parcel, whether a fee or otherwise, shall be stated in the petition.

After satisfaction of the applicable provisions of the eminent domain procedure law, the court shall ascertain and appraise the compensation to be made to the owners and all persons interested in the real estate laid down on such maps, as proposed to be taken or affected for the purposes indicated in this subchapter. There shall be submitted to the same judge, at one time, however, only as many parcels as can reasonably be passed upon and an award made therefor, by the court, within the limits of one year from entry of the order granting the petition.

b. After the testimony is closed, the court shall without unnecessary delay, ascertain and determine the just compensation which should be made by the city to the owners, or to the persons interested in the real estate sought to be acquired or affected by such proceedings.

c. In the ascertainment of the compensation for any property or property rights so acquired, such compensation shall be based upon the actual values of the property or the interest acquired therein at the time of its taking, and there shall not be taken into consideration any prospective or speculative value, based upon the possible, probable or actual future use of such property, or property rights, if the same had not been acquired by the city for public use.

d. The court shall determine:

   1. The height to which the waters of any lake, pond, or natural stream concerning which such proceedings were instituted may be raised and the point to which such waters may be drawn down by the city, such determination to be made before any award of damages shall be made on account of such proposed raising or depression of such waters.

   3. A statement of the names of respective owners of or persons entitled thereto or interested therein. In all cases where the owners and parties interested, or their respective estates or interests are unknown, or not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient for the court to set forth and state, in general terms, the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners thereof and parties interested therein generally, without specifying the names or estates or interests of such owners or parties interested or any or either of them. The court shall also recommend such sums as shall seem to the court proper to be allowed to the parties or attorneys appearing before the court, as costs, counsel fees, expenses and disbursements, including reasonable compensation for witnesses as provided in sections seven hundred one and seven hundred two of the eminent domain procedure law.

b. The court, in its discretion, may take up any specified claim or claims, and finally ascertain and determine the compensation to be made thereon, and make a separate finding with reference thereto, annexing to such finding a copy of so much of the maps as displays the parcel or parcels so reported on. Such finding, as to the claims therein specified, shall be the finding required in this subchapter, and the subsequent action with reference thereto shall be had in the same manner as though no other claim was embraced in the proceeding, which, however, shall continue as to all claims upon which no such determination and finding shall have been made.

c. The tentative decree, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the real estate shall be situated.

The court shall also direct to whom the money shall be paid, or in which trust company it shall be deposited by the comptroller. Such decree when so confirmed, except in the case of an appeal, as provided in section 5-369 of this subchapter, shall be final and conclusive as well upon the city as upon the owners and all persons interested in or entitled to such real estate, and also upon all other persons whomsoever.

If the city shall have been unable to secure such approval of the municipal authorities of the village or the town board of the town in which the land to be acquired is located, where such real estate shall be located within the Esopus and Schoharie watersheds in the counties of Ulster, Delaware, Schoharie and Greene, and the plans for such operating systems and plants for the collection and disposal of sewage shall have been approved by the state department of health, the city acting by or through its commissioner of environmental protection, notwithstanding the provisions of any special or general act to the contrary, may present a petition to the supreme court in the county involved, stating the proposed location of such operating system or plant for the collection and disposal of sewage, that the plans therefor have been approved by the state department of health, that application for the location thereof in accordance with such plans has been made to the municipal authorities or town board having jurisdiction thereover and has been unreasonably denied, or withheld, and such other facts as the petitioner may deem pertinent, together with a prayer for an order authorizing the construction of such operating system or sewage disposal plant in accordance with such plans. Notice of the time and place of presentation of such petition shall be served on the necessary municipal authorities or town board having jurisdiction over such applications and on the state department of health, and posted in such village or town in at least ten conspicuous public places for a period of ten days prior to the hearing of such petition. Upon the presentation of such petition, the presiding justice shall hear the parties to such proceeding and also such other residents of the sewer district of the village or town as desire to be heard. If the justice presiding be satisfied that the municipal authorities of the village or the town board of the town have unreasonably withheld the approval of the location of such operating system or sewage disposal plant, the justice may, by order, grant the petition. Upon the entry of such order, the city may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, in the manner provided by law, such real estate, rights of way and easements to and into such real estate as may be necessary for the proper erection, construction and operation, of such operating system or sewage disposal plant, and may construct the same in accordance with the plans approved by the state department of health.







**Subchapter 3-a: Water Supply**



*§ 5-376 Determination of additional sources of water supply; reports to board of estimate.* ::


a. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of environmental protection to proceed immediately and with all reasonable speed, to ascertain what sources exist and are most available, desirable and best for an additional supply of pure and wholesome water for the city. The commissioner shall make such studies, investigations, surveys, maps, plans, profiles, estimates and reports as the commissioner may deem proper in order to ascertain the facts as to such sources and shall report to the board of estimate with recommendations as to what action should in the commissioner's opinion be taken with reference thereto. It shall be lawful for the board of estimate and the commissioner to report upon, consider and determine the project in parts or sections from time to time as they may deem fit, so that the city may be able to obtain an additional supply of water from one or more sources before the whole additional supply contemplated may be obtained.

b. If at any time the board of estimate shall determine it to be advisable that the needs of the city with respect to its water supply or with regard to the delivery of such supply to points convenient for distribution among the several boroughs shall be made the subject of study and investigation, the commissioner of environmental protection shall forthwith proceed with such studies and investigations and, together with his or her recommendations, report to the board of estimate. Upon receipt of any such report the board of estimate may consider and act upon it in the same manner and with the same authority as provided in this section and in any following sections.






*§ 5-377 Further reports to board of estimate; hearings; map or plan of whole work to be approved and filed.* ::


a. The board of estimate upon the receipt of such report or reports of the commissioner may adopt, modify or reject the whole or any part of the same, and may cause such studies, investigations, surveys, maps, plans, profiles, estimates and reports to be made, and such further information to be obtained as the commissioner shall deem expedient to enable him or her to act intelligently in the premises. In case of the modification or rejection of the recommendations in such report or reports or any part thereof by the board of estimate, the commissioner in like manner as aforesaid shall prepare and submit to the board of estimate further studies, investigations, surveys, maps, plans, profiles, estimates and reports and make such changes and modifications as shall seem proper to the board of estimate, and shall continue so to do under the direction of the board of estimate, until a map, plan or plans covering the entire work contemplated by this subchapter shall be approved and adopted by such board. The map, plan or plans may be made and adopted in parts or sections from time to time, and may be changed or modified either before or after adoption as the board of estimate may deem necessary for the more efficient carrying out of the provisions of this subchapter.

b. The board of estimate prior to the adoption of such map, plan or plans, or to a modification thereof shall afford to all persons interested a reasonable opportunity to be heard respecting the same, and shall give reasonable public notice of such hearing, at which testimony may be produced by the parties appearing in such manner as the board of estimate may determine, and each member of the board is hereby authorized to administer oaths and issue subpoenas in any proceeding pending before them under this subchapter. Notice of such hearing shall be given, in addition to the above provision, by mailing to the chairperson and clerk of the board of supervisors of the county where the real estate to be acquired is situated a notice of such hearing at least eight days before the time named in the notice.

c. A final map, plan or plans approved and adopted by the board of estimate shall be executed in quadruplicate, one of which shall remain on file with the clerk of the board of estimate, one shall be placed on file in the office of the commissioner of environmental protection, one, or a certified copy thereof, shall be filed in the county clerk's office or register's office of each county in which any of the land affected thereby is situated.

d. Provided, however, that no reservoir or other structure for the storage or impounding of water, shall be constructed, at any time, within the drainage area of the Esopus creek in the county of Ulster, other than that designated in the reports of William H. Burr, Rudolph Hering and John R. Freeman to the Honorable George B. McClellan, mayor, chairman, board of estimate of the city of New York, as to the Ashokan reservoir, the flow line of which shall not exceed elevation six hundred feet coast and geodetic survey datum.






*§ 5-378 Entry to prepare maps and to post notice.* ::


The commissioner of environmental protection, the commissioner's agents, engineers, surveyors and such other persons as may be necessary to enable the commissioner to perform his or her duties under this subchapter are hereby authorized to enter upon any land, or water, for the purpose of making surveys, examinations or investigations and preparing the maps, plans and reports contemplated by this subchapter and for the purpose of posting any notices that may be required to be published in like manner.






*§ 5-379 Real estate maps; preparation, submission and adoption thereof.* ::


After the approval, adoption and filing of a final map, plan or plans described in section 5-377 of this subchapter, the commissioner shall prepare and submit to the board of estimate six similar maps of the real estate to be acquired or affected for the purpose of carrying out the said plan or plans, or any part thereof. Upon those maps there shall be laid out and separately numbered the various parcels of real estate acquisition of which is made necessary for the prosecution of the work authorized by this subchapter, including the lands adjoining the Esopus creek between the point on such creek, in the town of Shandaken, Ulster county, where the Schoharie tunnel empties into such creek, and the Ashokan reservoir of the city, in such county, the owners of which lands shall be entitled to recover the decrease in value of such lands by reason of any acts of the city under the provisions of this subchapter or any previous act, such damages to be determined by a commission in the same manner as damages for the taking of real property are determined. On such maps, the property division lines existing at the time of the survey shall be delineated, and there shall be plainly indicated those parcels of which the fee, and over or through which parcels the right to use and occupy the same temporarily or in perpetuity, is to be acquired. The board of estimate may adopt, modify or reject such maps in whole or in part and require others to be made instead thereof. In case of such rejection, the commissioner of environmental protection shall in like manner, as aforesaid, prepare and submit others, until maps shall be approved by the board of estimate covering the entire area required for the purpose of carrying out the said plan or plans, or any part thereof. Such maps may be made and filed in sections. One or more sections may be determined before the maps of the whole construction are completed. Such sections shall be determined and decided upon previous to the appointment of the commissions as hereinafter provided for, and shall be so determined that one commission shall not be appointed for a section covering more property than can reasonably be passed upon and awards made by such commission within the limits of a year from the time of the filing of the oaths, as hereinafter provided. The proceedings hereinafter authorized may, in like manner, be taken separately in reference to one or more of such sections before the maps of the whole are filed. The work upon one or more of such sections may be begun before the maps of the remaining sections are filed. The maps when adopted by the board of estimate shall be transmitted by such board to the corporation counsel, with a certificate of such adoption written thereon and signed by a majority of the board.






*§ 5-380 Maps; filing of.* ::


The corporation counsel shall cause one of the maps described in section 5-379 of this subchapter, or a certified copy thereof, to be filed in the office of the clerk of each county in which any real estate laid out on such map shall be located except that in any county in which there is a register's office, such map shall be filed therein instead of in the office of the county clerk. The other maps described in section 5-379 of this subchapter shall be disposed of in the manner indicated in succeeding sections of this subchapter.






*§ 5-381 Application for appointment of commissioners of appraisal.* ::


After such maps shall have been filed as provided for in the preceding section of this subchapter, the corporation counsel, for and on behalf of the city, upon first giving the notice required in the next section of this subchapter, shall apply to the supreme court at any special term thereof to be held in the judicial district in which the lands or some part thereof shown on such maps, and the title to which it is proposed to acquire in the proceeding thus instituted, is situated, for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal. Upon such application the corporation counsel shall present to the court a petition signed and verified by the commissioner of environmental protection, according to the practice of the court, setting forth the action theretofore taken by the commissioner and by the board of estimate and the filing of such maps, and praying for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal. Such petition shall contain a general description of all the real estate to, in, or over which any title, interest, right or easement is sought to be acquired for the city for the purpose of this subchapter, each parcel being more particularly described by a reference to the number of such parcel as given on such maps, and the title, interest or easement sought to be acquired to, in or over such parcel, whether a fee or otherwise, shall be stated in the petition.






*§ 5-382 Notice of application for appointment of commissioners of appraisal.* ::


The corporation counsel shall give notice in the City Record, and in two public newspapers published in the city of New York and in two public newspapers published in each other county in which any real estate laid out on such maps may be located, and which it is proposed to acquire in the proceeding, of the corporation counsel's intention to make application to such court for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal which notice shall specify the time and place of such application, shall briefly state the object of the applications and shall describe the real estate sought to be taken or affected. A statement of the real estate to be acquired or affected for the purpose of carrying out the said plan or plans or in any part thereof with separate enumerations of the numbers of the parcels to be taken in fee, and of the numbers of the parcels in which an easement is to be acquired, together with the route of the tunnels and aqueducts by courses and distances and of the greatest and least width of its required easement or parcel of land with a reference to the dates and places of filing such maps, shall be sufficient description of the real estate sought to be so taken or affected. Such notice shall be so published, once in each week, in each of such newspapers, for six weeks immediately previous to the presentation of such petition; and the corporation counsel shall in addition to such advertisement cause copies of the same in hand bills to be posted up, for the same space of time in at least twenty conspicuous places on the line of the aqueduct or in the vicinity of the real estate so to be taken or affected and shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the owners of such real estate whose names and addresses are known or are readily ascertainable. After the original appointment of commissioners of appraisal pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, the corporation counsel may apply at a special term of the supreme court in the same judicial district where application for such original commission was made for the appointment of a successor commission, upon first giving ten days' notice by advertisement in the newspapers hereinabove described of his or her intention to make such application.






*§ 5-383 Appointment of commissioners of appraisal; their qualifications.* ::


At the time and place mentioned in such notice, unless such court shall adjourn such application to a subsequent day and in that event at the time to which the same may be adjourned, such court, upon due proof to its satisfaction of the required publication and posting aforesaid, and upon filing such petition, shall make an order for the appointment of three disinterested and competent freeholders, at least one of whom shall reside in the city and at least one of whom shall reside in the county or one of the counties in which such real estate shall be situated, as commissioner of appraisal to ascertain and appraise the compensation to be made to the owners and all persons interested in the real estate laid down on such maps as proposed to be taken or affected for the purpose indicated in this subchapter. Such order shall fix the time and place for the first meeting of such commissioners.






*§ 5-384 Oath of commissioners of appraisal; filing thereof.* ::


Such commissioners shall take and subscribe the oath or affirmation required by article thirteen of the constitution and shall forthwith file the same or a certified copy thereof in the office of the clerk of the county in which the land or any part thereof is situated, and shall forthwith file certified copies of such oaths in the office of the clerk of the county of New York, and in the register's office in any county in which there is a register's office and in which is situated any of the real estate sought to be taken or affected by the proceeding.






*§ 5-385 Eligibility of commissioners for reappointment.* ::


No person appointed a commissioner of appraisal in any proceedings conducted under this subchapter shall be eligible for reappointment on any commission provided for under this subchapter until three years shall have elapsed since such person shall have finished the duties imposed upon him or her as a commissioner under any previous appointment except a person appointed to fill a vacancy occurring in a commission more than six months after the original appointment of such commission, which said appointee shall be eligible for one additional appointment to the successor commission or any other commission.






*§ 5-386 Vesting of title; possession; removal of buildings or improvements.* ::


On filing such oaths, in the manner provided in section 5-384 of this subchapter, the city shall be and become seized in fee of all those parcels of real estate which are on the maps referred to in section 5-379 of this subchapter delineated as parcels, of which it has been determined that the fee should be acquired, and shall also be and become vested of the easements, in, over, upon or through all those other parcels of real estate which are on said maps delineated as parcels in, over, upon or through which it has been determined that easements should be acquired; and may immediately or at any time or times thereafter take possession of the same or any part or parts thereof without any suit or proceeding at law for that purpose; provided, however, that before the city takes possession of the same it shall pay to the respective owner or owners of each of such parcels of real estate, which are upon such maps delineated as parcels of which it has been determined that the fee should be acquired, (a) if located outside the counties of Ulster, Greene, Sullivan, Schoharie and Delaware, a sum of money equal to one-half the assessed valuation of such real property as the same appears upon the assessment roll of the town or tax district in which the same is situate for the year next preceding that in which the city becomes seized in fee of each of such parcels of real estate, and (b) if located in the counties of Ulster, Greene, Sullivan, Schoharie or Delaware, a sum of money equal to fifty per centum of the full valuation of such real estate. In the event that a parcel so delineated on said map as a fee parcel is not separately assessed on the assessment roll of the town or tax district in which the same is situated but is assessed as a part of another tract, then the amount which the city shall be required to pay or deposit under this section shall be (a) if the parcel be located outside the counties of Ulster, Greene, Sullivan, Schoharie and Delaware, the proportion which the assessed valuation of the parcel acquired bears to the assessed valuation of the entire property as a part of which said parcel is assessed, and (b) if the parcel be located in the counties of Ulster, Greene, Sullivan, Schoharie or Delaware, the proportion which the full valuation of the parcel acquired bears to the full valuation of the entire property as a part of which said parcel is assessed. The supreme court in the judicial district in which the land is situated is hereby authorized to make an order prorating such assessed valuation or full valuation, as the case may be, and to determine the proportion of such assessed valuation or full valuation, as the case may be, which the city of New York shall be required to pay before taking possession of such parcel. The city, at its option and by agreement with such respective owner or owners, may, instead of paying to him or her or them the amount or amounts hereinbefore required, pay to him or her or them a sum or sums of money greater than but not more than twice the amount or amounts hereinbefore required. For the purposes of this section only, "full valuation" of real estate shall mean the assessed valuation thereof, as the same appears on the assessment roll of the town or tax district in which the real estate is situate for the year next preceding that in which the city becomes seized in fee thereof, divided by the rate of assessment of real property in such town or tax district for the same year as finally recommended for adoption by the state tax commission under the provisions of the real property tax law formerly contained in sections fifty and one hundred seventy-four of the tax law. Deposit of all moneys hereunder to the credit of, or payable to the order of the owner, pursuant to the direction of the court, shall be deemed a payment within the provisions of this section, and, thereupon, the commissioner of environmental protection, or any person or persons acting under their or its authority may enter upon and use and occupy to the exclusion of any and all other persons all the parcels of real estate delineated on such map for the purpose of carrying out the plan or plans, or any part thereof, described in section 5-377 of this subchapter, provided, however, that no buildings or improvements shall be removed or disturbed within one year from the date of the filing of the oaths of the commissioners unless thirty days' notice in writing is given to the owner, or to his or her attorney, if any, by the corporation counsel of the intention to make such removal, and affording the owner an opportunity to examine the property with the commissioners of appraisal and such witnesses as he or she may desire. If the owner of the property can not be found with due diligence, and there is no attorney representing such property or parcel, before removing, disturbing, or destroying any of the buildings, or the improvements, a representative of the commissioner of environmental protection or of the corporation counsel shall cause measurements to be made of the buildings and photographs of the exterior views thereof, which measurements and photographs shall be at the disposition thereafter of the claimants, or their attorneys, in case such claimants or their attorneys should appear and demand the same before the case is tried.






*§ 5-387 Commissioners of appraisal; powers and proceedings thereof; provisions for filling of vacancies.* ::


a. Any one of such commissioners of appraisal may issue subpoenas and administer oaths to witnesses; and they or any one of them, in the absence of the others, may adjourn the proceedings from time to time in their discretion; but they shall continue to meet from time to time as may be necessary, within the judicial district where the lands or any part thereof may be located, to hear, consider and determine upon all claims which may be presented to them under the provisions of this subchapter. Within thirty days after the commissioners have been appointed and have qualified, the city shall furnish the commission with a list of the claims that have been filed and are to be determined and the commissioners shall have full power and authority to prepare a calendar of all such claims and to determine the order and priority of the hearing of such claims; to set down the hearing of any such claim for a day certain; and to order an inquest in or a dismissal of any claim for failure of a party to appear at the time designated for the hearing thereof unless the commissioners shall determine that a reasonable excuse for such failure exists. They shall view the real estate laid down on the maps and shall hear the proofs and allegations of any owner, lessee, or other person in any way entitled to or interested in such real estate or any part or parcel thereof, and also such proofs and allegations as may be offered on behalf of the city. They shall rule upon motions and objections made in connection with the admission or exculsion of testimony or evidence in any hearing before the commissioners and shall make findings upon which their awards are made and separate findings upon which the fees and allowances are based. They shall reduce the testimony taken before them to writing, and after the testimony is closed, they or a majority of them, all having considered the same, and having an opportunity to be present, shall without unnecessary delay, ascertain and determine the just and equitable compensation which ought justly to be made by the city to the owners or the persons interested in the real estate sought to be acquired or affected by such proceedings, including just and equitable compensation to the owner of any leasehold taken or affected in the proceeding. Such commissioners of appraisal shall make reports of their proceedings to the supreme court as in the next section provided, with the minutes of the testimony taken by them and the findings of fact made by them, and they shall be entitled to the payments hereinafter provided for their services and expenses to be paid from the fund hereinafter provided.

b. In case of the death, resignation, refusal or neglect to serve of any or all of such commissioners of appraisal, the corporation counsel shall upon ten days' notice to be given by advertisement in the newspapers designated as hereinbefore provided, apply to the supreme court at a special term thereof, to be held in the judicial district in which the land or any part thereof affected by the proceedings, is situated, for the appointment of one or more commissioners to fill the vacancy or vacancies so occasioned.

c. In the event that the corporation counsel shall fail, neglect or refuse to make such application within thirty days after any such vacancy shall have occurred as hereinabove provided, any person interested in the proceeding may similarly apply after such advertisement for the filling of any vacancy. The city of New York shall be liable for the reasonable expenses of such advertisement together with ten dollars costs of motion in the event of any such application by any such interested person.






*§ 5-388 Report of commissioners; compensation for loss to railroad or electric corporation or owner of water power; expenses.* ::


a. The commissioners of appraisal shall prepare a report, and such copies thereof as may be required. Such report or reports shall contain a brief description of the several parcels of real estate so acquired, taken or affected, with a reference to the map or maps as showing the exact location and boundaries of each parcel; a statement of the sum estimated and determined upon by them as a just and equitable compensation to be made by the city to the owners or persons entitled to or interested in each parcel so taken, or as to which any right, title, interest, privilege or easement is taken, acquired or extinguished; and a statement of the respective owners or persons entitled thereto, or interested therein. In every case where the owners and parties interested, or their respective estates or interests are unknown, or not fully known to the commissioners of appraisal, it shall be sufficient for them to set forth and state in general terms the respective sums to be allowed and paid to the owners of, and parties interested therein generally, without specifying the name of estates or interests of such owners, or parties interested, or any or either of them.

b. Where loss, damage or expense, direct or consequential, has resulted to any duly incorporated railroad corporation, operating a steam railroad in any county in which land shall be acquired in pursuance of the provisions of this subchapter, or by reason of any of the matters in this subchapter involved, or any electric corporation, or the owner of any water power on any of the streams or waters affected by the provisions of this subchapter, the board of estimate is hereby authorized and empowered to agree with such railroad corporation, or any such electric corporation, or the owner of any such water power, upon the compensation which shall be made to it for such loss, damage or expense. In the event of no agreement being reached between such board and such railroad corporation, or any such electric corporation, or the owner of any such water power, the commissioners of appraisal appointed to estimate damages for lands acquired in such county are hereby authorized and directed to pass upon such claim and to make awards therefor as provided in this subchapter.

c. Subject to review by the court as hereinafter provided, the commissioners may also recommend such sums, if any, as shall seem to them proper to be allowed, to parties appearing in the proceeding, as expenses and disbursements including reasonable compensation for witnesses and what sums, if any, ought to be paid to the general or special guardian of an infant, idiot, or person of unsound mind, or to an attorney appointed by the court to attend to the interests of any known owner or party in interest who has not appeared in the proceedings for expenses or counsel fees.

Such report signed by such commissioners or a majority of them, shall be filed not more than one year after the date of the filing of the oaths of the commissioners in the office of a clerk of a county in which real estate sought to be acquired may be situated and in case a part of the real estate is in another county a duplicate report or certified copy shall be filed in the office of the clerk of such other county, provided, however, that the supreme court upon application and good reasons shown therefor may extend the time for the taking of testimony or for the preparation and filing of such report, or both, beyond one year for a period not exceeding eight months. The commissioners of appraisal shall notify the corporation counsel immediately upon the filing of a report.






*§ 5-390 Notice of hearing on report.* ::


The corporation counsel, or in case of the corporation counsel's neglect to do so within ten days after receiving notice of such filing, any person interested in the proceeding, shall give notice that such report will be presented for confirmation, modification (specifying the particulars of such modification in respect to the amount of the award, witness fees or other allowances made by the commissioners) or for rejection in whole or in part to the justice of the supreme court appointing the commissioners, or if the justice be unavailable, to a justice of the supreme court at a special term thereof, to be held in the judicial district in which the land or a part thereof is situated at a time and place to be specified in such notice, and the objections, if any, to the confirmation, modification or rejection of such report or any part thereof, shall be heard at such special term. The notice shall contain a statement of the time and place of the filing of the report and of the copy or copies thereof, and shall be published once in each week in each of the newspapers referred to previously in this subchapter, for at least three weeks immediately prior to the presentation of such report to the supreme court. As used in this section, section 5-391 and section 5-399 of this subchapter, the terms "modify" and "modification" shall be construed to include an increase, a decrease or any other change in an award, fee or allowance.






*§ 5-391 Hearing on the report.* ::


The application for the confirmation, modification or rejection of the report shall be made to the supreme court at a special term thereof held in the judicial district in which the land or some part thereof is situated. Upon the hearing of the application such court may confirm or modify such report or may in its discretion order that the report or any portion thereof affecting one or more parcels be referred to the same commission, or a new commission for a new hearing, and make an order containing a recital of the substance of the proceedings in the matter of the appraisal with a general description of the real estate appraised and for which compensation is to be made; and shall also direct to whom the money is to be paid or in what bank or trust company and in what manner it shall be deposited by the comptroller. Such order confirming or modifying the report shall (except in case of an appeal, as provided in this subchapter) be final and conclusive as well upon the city as upon owners and all persons interested in or entitled to such real estate; and also upon all other persons whomsoever.






*§ 5-392 Payment by the city.* ::


The city shall, within three calendar months after the confirmation of the report of the commissioners of appraisal, pay to the respective owners and bodies politic or corporate, mentioned or referred to in such report, in whose favor, any sum or sums of money shall be estimated and reported by such commissioners, the respective sum or sums so estimated and reported in their favor respectively, with lawful interest thereon, from the date of filing the oath and certified copies thereof as by this subchapter required, deducting therefrom all sums of money paid on account thereof as provided in section 5-386 of this subchapter. In case of neglect or default in the payment of the same within the time aforesaid, the respective person or persons or bodies politic or corporate in whose favor the same shall be so reported, his, her, or their executors, administrators or successors, at any time or times, after application first made by him, her, or them, to the comptroller for payment thereof, may sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest as aforesaid, and the costs of suit in any proper form of action against the city in any court having cognizance thereof, and it shall be sufficient to declare generally for so much money due to the plaintiff or plaintiffs therein by virtue of this subchapter for real estate taken or affected for the purpose herein mentioned, and the report of such commissioners, with proof of the right and title of the plaintiff or plaintiffs to the sum or sums demanded shall be conclusive evidence in such suit or action.

(b) in the case of claims under section 5-423, within three years from the date of the filing of the oaths of the commissioners appointed after the acquisition by the city of New York of the real estate, the acquisition of which is claimed to be the direct or indirect cause of damage, or within three years from the execution of the plan or work, the execution of which is claimed to be the direct or indirect cause of damage. In the case of real estate acquired in fee or in which an easement is acquired, every person neglecting or refusing to present a claim within such time shall be deemed to have surrendered his or her interest in such real estate or his or her claims for damages thereto, except so far as such person may be entitled as an owner of, or person interested in the award, if any, made by the commissioners of appraisal.

At least ten days prior to such calendar call the corporation counsel shall give personal notice in writing to any or all persons interested in the proceeding and their attorneys, if any, that such a calendar call will be held and that dates will be fixed for the hearing and presentation of claims. All persons so notified may appear at such calendar call for the purpose of having dates fixed for the hearing and presentation of their claims. In the event that persons so notified fail to appear at such calendar call, the commission at the request of the corporation counsel shall fix dates for the hearing and presentation of their claims, which dates shall be not less than twenty days after such calendar call. The corporation counsel shall further notify such persons in writing of the dates thus fixed, which notice shall be so served not less than five days before the date so fixed. All persons failing to appear on the dates fixed by the commission at such calendar call, or failing to give legal excuse for so failing to appear to the commission at or before the time of such calendar call, shall forfeit their right to interest from and after the date fixed by the commission at the calendar call on any award made to them.

Whenever the owner or owners, person or persons interested in any real estate taken or affected in such proceedings, or in whose favor any such sum or sums or compensation shall be so reported shall be under the age of twenty-one years, of unsound mind, or absent from the state of New York, and also in all cases where the name or names of the owner or owners, person or persons interested in any such real estate shall not be set forth or mentioned in such report, or where the owner or owners, person or persons being named therein, can not upon diligent inquiry be found, or where there are adverse or conflicting claims to the moneys awarded as compensation, it shall be lawful for the city to pay the sum or sums mentioned in such report, payable, or that would be coming to such owner or owners, persons or persons respectively, with interest aforesaid, into such trust company as the court may in the order of confirmation direct, to the credit of such owner or owners, person or persons, and such payment shall be as valid and effectual, in all respects as if made to such owner or owners, person or persons interested therein respectively, themselves, according to their just rights. In all cases, however, where any such sum or sums or compensation, reported by the commissioners in favor of any person or persons or party or parties, whatsoever, whether named or not named in such report shall be paid to any person or persons or party or parties, whomsoever, when the same shall of right belong and ought to have been paid to some other person or persons, or party or parties, it shall be lawful for the person or persons or party or parties to whom the same ought to have been paid, to sue for and recover the same with lawful interest and costs of suit as so much money had and received to his, her or their use by the person or persons, party or parties, respectively, to whom the same shall have been so paid.






*§ 5-397 Separate reports by the commissioners.* ::


The commissioners of appraisal may, in their discretion, take up any specified claim or claims and finally ascertain and determine the compensation to be made thereon, and make a separate report with reference thereto, annexing to such report a copy of so much of the maps as displays the parcel or parcels so reported on. Such report as to the claims therein specified shall be the report required in this subchapter, and the subsequent action with reference thereto shall be had in the same manner as though no other claim were embraced in such proceeding, which, however, shall continue as to all claims upon which no such determination and report is made.






*§ 5-398 Unforeseeable damages; settlement or determination thereof.* ::


Whenever the owner of any private property any part of or interest in which shall have been taken under any proceeding had pursuant to this subchapter shall claim that the prosecution of any work done pursuant to such proceeding has been the proximate cause of actual and material damage to any part of such property and that commissioners of appraisal could not have taken cognizance of such damage pursuant to section 5-387 of this subchapter, until the actual happening thereof because of its unforeseeable or speculative nature, the proper person or board representing the city may agree with such owner as to the amount of such damages. If such agreement cannot be made, such owner may present to the commissioners of appraisal his or her claim in writing duly verified on oath. It shall be the duty of the commissioners to hear allegations and proofs and to proceed in like manner as is provided in the case of property taken pursuant to such proceedings as aforesaid and to determine such actual damages, if any, which were unforeseeable or speculative until the actual happening thereof. The amount of such damages so agreed upon, if any, or so determined, shall be payable and collectible in the same manner as is provided in the case of awards made through the confirmation of a report of commissioners of appraisal in such proceedings. In case at the time of making any such claim there shall be no commissioners authorized to take cognizance thereof, the corporation counsel, for and on behalf of the city, shall make an application for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal in the manner prescribed by this subchapter, to take cognizance of such claims. Provided, however, that such claims shall be presented in the manner above specified within two years from and after the completion of the work, the prosecution of which is claimed to have been the proximate cause of such damage and that such claim shall be supported by proof of interest in the property alleged to have been damaged and of such damage and that it resulted proximately from the prosecution of such work, as aforesaid, and that it was so unforeseeable or speculative, as aforesaid; and that the claim could not, with due diligence, have been presented to prior commissioners of appraisal subsequently to the happening of the damage. In every case the payment of the amount agreed upon or determined or adjudged under and pursuant to this section shall be a continuing, complete, and conclusive bar to all claim of damage by anyone whomsoever to the property concerned or any part thereof due to the prosecution of the work.






*§ 5-399 Appeal from the report of the commissioners.* ::


Within twenty days after notice of the confirmation, modification or rejection of the report of the commissioners, as provided for in section 5-391 of this subchapter, either party may appeal, by notice in writing to the other party, to the appellate division of the supreme court, from the order confirming, modifying or rejecting the report of the commissioners. Such appeal shall be heard on due notice thereof being given, according to the rules and practice of such court. On the hearing of such appeal, the court may affirm, modify or reverse the order of special term or it may direct a new appraisal and determination of any question passed upon, by the same or new commissioners, in its discretion, but from any determination of the appellate division, either party, if aggrieved, may take an appeal which shall be heard and determined by the court of appeals. If the amount of compensation to be made by the city is increased after a new trial, the difference shall be paid by the comptroller to the parties entitled to the same, or shall be deposited, as the court may direct; and if the amount is diminished, the difference shall be refunded to such city by the party to whom the same may have been paid, the judgment therefor may be rendered by the court, on the filing of a subsequent decision, against the party liable to pay the same. But the taking of an appeal by any person or persons shall not operate to stay the proceedings under this subchapter, except as to the particular parcel of real estate with which such appeal is concerned. Such appeal shall be heard upon the evidence taken before such commissioners, and any affidavits as to irregularities submitted to the court at special term, and three typewritten copies of such evidence shall be furnished by the city to the party taking the appeal within ten days after the appeal is perfected, and such appeals may be heard on the evidence so furnished, and such appeals may be taken without security thereon.






*§ 5-401 Powers of the supreme court.* ::


The supreme court of the judicial district in which the real estate, or any part thereof, is situated, shall have power at any time to amend any defect or informality in any of the special proceedings authorized by this subchapter as may be necessary, or to cause other property to be included therein and to direct such further notice to be given to any party in interest as it deems proper, and also to appoint other commissioners in place of any who shall die, or refuse or neglect to serve, or be incapable of serving or be removed. Such court may at any time remove any of such commissioners of appraisal who, in its judgment, shall be incapable of serving or who shall for any reason in its judgment be an unfit person to serve as such commissioner. The cause of such removal shall be specified in the order making the same. If, in any particular, it shall, at any time, be found necessary to amend any pleading or proceeding, or to supply any defect therein, arising in the course of any special proceeding authorized by this subchapter, the same may be corrected or supplied in such manner as may be directed by the supreme court, which is hereby authorized to make such amendment or correction.






*§ 5-402 Agreements as to compensation.* ::


The commissioner of environmental protection, subject to the approval of the board of estimate, may agree with the owners and persons interested in any real estate laid down on such maps as to the amount of compensation to be paid to such owners or persons interested for the taking or using and occupying such real estate. In case any such real estate shall be owned, occupied or enjoyed by the people of this state or by any county, town or school district within this state, such rights, titles, interests or properties may be paid for upon agreement respectively with the office of general services, who shall act for the people of the state, with a chairman and a majority in numbers of the board of supervisors of any county who shall act for such county, and with the supervisors and commissioner of highways, of any town who shall all act for such town, and with the trustees of any school district who shall act for such district. The office of general services shall have power to grant to the city any real estate belonging to the people of this state, which may be required for the purposes indicated in this subchapter, on such terms as may be agreed on between it and the commissioner of environmental protection, always, however, reserving and maintaining the rights of the people and riparian owners to go to the water at any point to which the same may be drawn. If any real estate of any county, town or school district is required by the city for the purposes of this subchapter the majority of the board of supervisors acting for such county, or the supervisors of any such town, with the commissioners of highway therein acting for such town, or the trustees of any school district acting for such district, may grant or surrender such real estate for such compensation as may be agreed upon between such officers respectively and the commissioner of environmental protection.






*§ 5-403 Definitions; special provision concerning acquisition of real estate used for public purposes.* ::


The term real estate as used in this subchapter shall be construed to signify and embrace all uplands, lands under water, the waters of any lake, pond or stream, all water rights or privileges, and any and all easements and incorporated hereditaments and every estate, interest and right, legal and equitable, in land or water, including terms for years, and liens thereon by way of judgment, mortgages or otherwise, and also all claims for damage to such real estate. It shall also be construed to include all real estate (as the term is above defined) heretofore or hereafter required or used for railroad, highway or other public purposes, providing the persons or corporations owning such real estate or claiming interest therein, shall be allowed the perpetual use for such purposes of the same or of such other real estate to be acquired for the purposes of this subchapter as will afford practicable route or location for such railroad, highway or other public purpose, and in the case of a railroad, commensurate with and adapted to its needs; and provided also that such persons or corporations shall not directly or indirectly be subject to expense, loss or damage by reason of changing such route or location, but that such expense, loss or damage shall be borne by the city. In case any real estate so acquired, or used for public purposes, is sought to be taken or affected for the purposes of this subchapter there shall be designated upon the maps referred to in the previous sections of this subchapter, and there shall be described in the petition, hereinbefore referred to, such portion of the other real estate shown on such maps and described in such petition, as it is proposed to substitute in place of the real estate then used for such railroad, highway or other public purposes. Provided, that wherever the commissioner of environmental protection has heretofore located on any map filed in the office of the commissioners of appraisal, a substituted route for any railroad, the same shall not be subsequently changed without the assent of such company. The supreme court at the special term to which the petition is presented or at such other special term as the consideration thereof may be adjourned to, shall either approve the substituted route or refer the same back to the commissioner of environmental protection for alteration or amendment and may refer the same back, with such directions or suggestions as such court may deem advisable, and as often as necessary and until such commissioners shall determine such substituted route as may be approved by the court. An appeal from any order made by such court at special term, under the provisions of this section, may be taken by any person or corporation interested in and aggrieved thereby to the appellate division and court of appeals, and shall be heard as a non-enumerated motion. The commissioners of appraisal, hereinbefore referred to, in determining the compensation to be made to the persons or corporations owning such real estate, or claiming interest therein, shall include in the amount of such compensation such sum as shall be sufficient to defray the expenses of making such change of route and location and of building such railroad or highway. Such commissioners of appraisal shall suggest in their report, and the court in the order confirming such report shall determine, subject to review by the appellate division, what reasonable time after payment of the awards to such persons or corporations shall be sufficient within which to complete the work of making such change. Neither the city, nor the commissioner of environmental protection shall be entitled to take possession or interfere with the use of such real estate for the enumerated purposes, before the expiration of such time. Such time may be subsequently extended by the court (subject to review as aforesaid) upon a sufficient cause shown. After the expiration of this time so determined or extended no use shall be made of such real estate which shall cause pollution to the water in such reservoir or interfere with its flow.






*§ 5-410 Compensation, fees, expenses and allowances.* ::


The commissioners of appraisal appointed in pursuance of this subchapter shall receive as compensation such fees and expenses as may be taxed by the court upon notice to the corporation counsel who shall also furnish them with the necessary clerks, stenographers, surveyors and other employees.

Such fees and expenses shall not be paid until they have been taxed before a justice of the supreme court in the judicial district in which the lands or some part thereof are situated upon eight days' notice to the corporation counsel. Such allowances shall in no case exceed the limits prescribed by section eight thousand three hundred three of the civil practice law and rules. The salaries and compensation of the persons employed, as provided for in this subchapter, to prepare the necessary surveys, plans and estimates and for other purposes and to direct, supervise and inspect the work required to be done under the provisions of this subchapter, and such other expenses in and about the same as are not herein required to be under contracts let after completion, shall be paid by the comptroller on the certification of the commissioner of environmental protection or of such person or persons as the commissioner may designate. The compensation and expenses of such of the corporation counsel's assistants or other counsel as the corporation counsel may designate to represent and aid the commissioner in the performance of his or her duties under this subchapter shall also be paid out of the funds provided therefor, and upon the certificate of the corporation counsel who shall have power to appoint such assistants or other counsel, and to fix their compensation. The various sums of money growing due from time to time, under the terms of the several contracts, made for the doing of the work and furnishing the material required by this subchapter, shall be paid by the comptroller on the certification of the commissioner of environmental protection or such person or persons as the commissioner may from time to time designate.

In connection with the closing or discontinuance of the subsurface or air space over such streets, the city may authorize the closing or discontinuance of so much of such streets, in whole or in part, for easements and such other rights as may be necessary or desirable in order to effect the construction and support of any improvements in the closed or discontinued air space over or the subsurface of such streets. Any such closing or discontinuance shall be effected as a capital project. In connection with any such closing or discontinuance, the city may acquire any right, title or interest in the closed or discontinued streets or the closed or discontinued portions thereof, including the surface or subsurface of or the air space over such streets as a capital project, whenever it may deem that such acquisition will more effectually secure the actual discontinuance and closing of streets, in whole or in part, which may be legally discontinued and closed pursuant to this subchapter. The provisions of this subchapter which refer to land or lands within or lying within a closed or discontinued street or within a street to be closed or discontinued shall be deemed to refer to the surface and subsurface of and air space over such street or any part of the surface or subsurface of or air space over such street.

2. State whether the effectual closing of such street, or other public necessity, requires the acquisition of the fee title to the whole or any portion of the land within the street to be closed, and in case it shall state that such acquisition is necessary, shall further request the mayor to provide for such acquisition simultaneously with the closing of such street, and shall specify and describe the part of the lands within the closed street, fee title to which should be acquired.

3.

The second map so certified shall be filed by such agency in the office of the corporation counsel. The third map shall be filed by such agency, and remain of record in the office in which instruments affecting real property in the county in which the closed street may be situated are required to be recorded. Such map shall be final and conclusive upon the city and upon all persons whomsoever.

In such case no proceeding shall be had to estimate such loss and damage as provided in this subchapter.

*§ 5-439 Closing of street; effect on real property contracts.* ::


In all cases where any part of any lot or parcel of land or other premises, under lease or other contract, shall be contiguous to any street after the closing thereof, all the covenants, contracts and agreements between landlord and tenant or any other contracting parties, touching the same or any part thereof, shall, upon the date of the closing thereof, respectively cease and determine and be absolutely discharged.

*§ 5-445 Note of issue of the proceeding.* ::


After all parties who have filed verified claims have proved their title, or have failed to do so after being notified by the corporation counsel of the time and place when and where such proof of title would be received by the corporation counsel, such corporation counsel shall serve upon all parties or their attorneys who have appeared in the proceeding, a note of issue thereof and shall file the same with the clerk of the court of the county in which the trial is to be had.

*§ 5-449 Amendment of street closing proceeding to include acquisition of fee title to closed street.* ::


Where a street has been closed pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter, and the compensation to be made for the damages caused by the closing thereof is to be ascertained and determined by the supreme court without a jury, and the city is not the owner of the fee title to the land within such closed street and the effectual closing of such street or part thereof, or other public necessity, requires that such city should acquire the fee title to the whole or part of the land within the closed street, the city shall be authorized to acquire the fee title thereto for the purposes provided by this subchapter. Such acquisition may be authorized before or after the institution of a proceeding to have the supreme court without a jury ascertain and determine the compensation to be made for the damages caused by the closing of such street, but the order of the mayor instituting the proceeding for the acquisition shall be approved prior to the filing of the tentative decree in any street closing proceeding. The mayor, in issuing such order, shall comply with the provisions of section 5-434 of this subchapter. Such order shall authorize and direct the corporation counsel to apply to the supreme court in the proper judicial district to have such court without a jury ascertain and determine the compensation which justly should be made to the respective owners of the fee title to the land within the closed street for the damages sustained by such owners on account of the acquisition by the city of the fee title thereto. Such order shall specify the date upon which the fee title to the land within the closed street shall become and be vested in the city, in accordance with the provisions of subdivision three of section 5-434, which date shall not be prior to the entry of the order authorizing the court to ascertain and determine the compensation to be made therefor nor subsequent to the entry of the final decree of the court in such proceeding. Upon the date so fixed, the fee title to the land within the closed street shall become and be vested in the city. Upon the issuance of such order the corporation counsel shall give notice by publication for ten days in the City Record that he or she will apply to the supreme court, stating the time and place when and where such application will be made, to have such court without a jury ascertain and determine the compensation which justly should be made to the respective owners of the fee title to the land within the closed street. Upon such application the corporation counsel shall present to the court a petition signed and verified by him or her, setting forth the action had by the mayor, and indicating the land within the closed street, the fee title to which is to be acquired by the city, by a precise description with courses and distances, having reference to the city map, an extract from which shall be attached, and praying that the compensation to be made therefor shall be ascertained and determined by such court without a jury. At the time and place specified in such notice, unless the court shall adjourn such application to a subsequent day, and, in that event, at the time and place to which the same may be adjourned, upon due proof to its satisfaction of the publication of such notice and upon the filing of such petition, the court shall enter an order granting the application, which order shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the closed street is situated. Awards for damages, due to the acquisition of the fee title to the land within the closed street, shall be made as provided in any proceeding instituted pursuant to this subchapter.






*§ 5-450 Agreements with owners.* ::


a. It shall also be lawful for the board of estimate, with respect to a street closing, and the mayor, with respect to acquisition, either before of after the institution of a proceeding under this subchapter, to agree with the owners of the real property that will be affected by such closing, for and about the cession to the city of other real property included within the boundaries of any established street shown on the city map, in lieu of the real property comprised within the lines of the closed street, or to agree for and about the compensation to be made to such owners for the same or for and about the value of real property to be ceded in lieu of such discontinued or closed portion or portions of such street.

b. In case of any such agreement or agreements with part only of the owners entitled to and interested in the same real property so affected, for the purpose of making any such discontinuance or closing, or cession in lieu of such closing, the same shall be valid and binding upon the parties thereto, and the court shall nevertheless enter upon and make or proceed with its estimate, and tentative and final decrees as to the residue of such real property affected by the closing, concerning which the owners thereof shall not agree.

c. The final decree of the court shall be of like force and effect in regard to the matters comprised therein, as if no such agreement as to the part of the premises had been made.






*§ 5-451 Tentative decree; preparation, contents and filing of.* ::


a. The court shall instruct the corporation counsel to prepare tabular abstracts of its estimated damage due to the closing, and of the damage due to the acquisition by the city of fee title to the land within the closed street and of the value of the city's interest in the respective parcels of the closed street. The tabular abstract of estimated damage due to the closing of the street shall set forth:

   1. The amount of loss and damage to each and every parcel of real property affected by the proceeding.

   2. The name of the respective owners of each and every parcel of real property affected thereby, as far as the same shall be ascertained.

A sufficient designation or description of the respective lots or parcels of real property damaged by the closing of the street or by the acquisition of the fee title to the lands in the closed street, by reference to numbers of the respective parcels indicated upon the surveys, diagrams, maps or plans which shall be attached to such tabular abstracts.

b. The court shall appraise and determine and separately set forth and state in the tabular abstract, the value of the right, title and interest of the city in and to the fee of the land within the closed street.

c. Such tabular abstracts shall be signed by the justice trying the proceedings and filed with the clerk of each county in which the closed street and the real property abutting thereon or any part of either may be situated and when so filed shall constitute the tentative decree of the court as to awards for damages and as to the value of the city's interest in the respective parcels of land within the closed street.






*§ 5-452 Notice to file objections; hearing thereon.* ::


a. Upon the filing of the tentative decree, the corporation counsel shall give notice, by advertisement to be published for fifteen days in the City Record, of the filing of such tentative decree, and that the city and all other parties to such proceeding or in any way interested in the real property affected thereby, having any objections thereto, shall file such objections, in writing, duly verified in the manner required by law for the verification of pleadings in an action, and setting forth the real property owned by the objector and his or her post office address, with such clerk within twenty days after the first publication of such notice, and that the corporation counsel, on a date specified in the notice, will apply to the justice who made the tentative decree to fix a time when the justice will hear the parties so objecting. Similar notice for at least ten days shall be given of the filing of any new, supplemental or amended tentative decree and for the filing of objections thereto. Every party so objecting or such party's attorney shall, within the same time, serve on the corporation counsel a copy of such verified objections.

b. Upon such application, the justice shall fix the time when he or she will hear the parties so objecting and desiring to be heard. At the time fixed, the justice shall hear the person or persons who have objected to the tentative decree or to the new, supplemental or amended tentative decree, and who may then and there appear, and shall have the power to adjourn, from time to time, until all parties who have filed objections and who desire to be heard shall have been fully heard.

c. After the filing of the tentative decree or of any new, or supplemental, or amended tentative decree, no award for damages shall be diminished without notice to the owner of the real property affected or the owner's attorney appearing in the proceeding, and an opportunity given for a hearing in regard thereto, before the signing of the final decree.






*§ 5-453 Correction of defects.* ::


The court shall have power at any time to correct any pleading or any defect or informality, in any special proceeding authorized by this subchapter, that may be necessary, or to amend any description, or cause other real property to be included therein or real property included therein to be excluded therefrom, or to permit any person having an interest therein to be made a party thereto, or to relieve from any default, mistake, or irregularity or to direct such further notice to be given to any party in interest as it shall deem proper.

   1. The several parcels damaged by the closing of the street and the several parcels of the closed street and the several parcels outside of the closed street, by reference to the numbers of such parcels on the respective maps, survey, diagrams, or plans attached thereto, duly corrected, when necessary, and it shall not be necessary to describe any parcels by a description by metes and bounds.

   2. The names of the respective owners of the several parcels damaged by the closing of such street, as far as the same shall have been ascertained, provided that in all cases where the owners are unknown or not fully known to the court, it shall be sufficient to set forth and state in general terms in the decree the respective sums to be allowed and paid to or by the owners of the respective parcels for loss or damage, without specifying their names or their estates or interests therein, and in such cases the owners may be specified as unknown.

Such appeal shall be taken and heard in the manner provided by the civil practice law and rules and the rules and practice of the court in relation to appeals in special proceedings. Such appeal shall be heard and determined by the appellate division upon the merits, both as to the questions of law and fact. The determination of the appellate division shall be in the form of an order. The taking of an appeal by any person or persons shall not operate to stay the proceedings under this subchapter, except as to the particular parcel of real property with which the appeal is concerned. The final decree of the court shall be deemed to be final and conclusive upon all parties and persons affected thereby, who have not appealed. Such appeal shall be heard upon the evidence taken before the court, or such part or portion thereof, as the justice at special term, who made the decree appealed from, may certify, or the parties to such appeal may agree upon as sufficient to present the merits of the questions in respect to which such appeal shall be had.

A notice shall be published in the City Record, for ten days, of the time and place of taxing such costs, charges and expenses, which shall be thereupon taxed by a justice of the supreme court, or by a referee under his or her special order.

In a capital project proceeding, such costs and expenses shall be deemed part of the cost of the acquisition of land or permanent rights in land and may be financed in the same manner as the acquisition of land or permanent rights in land.

b. Whenever the amount of damages awarded in any final decree, together with the costs which shall have been taxed in the proceeding, shall exceed the balance remaining in the fund, from which such amounts are payable, after deducting all outstanding claims against such balance, the court, upon proper application of an owner or other person entitled to such excess, shall require the city to issue and sell serial bonds the proceeds of which shall be paid into such fund to meet such deficiency.

c. In default of payment, in a capital project proceeding, the owners, or other persons entitled to be paid, may at any time after application first made to the comptroller therefor, sue for and recover the amount due, with lawful interest and the costs of suit.

d. Except when any sum or sums of money shall in the final decree be made to "unknown owners", the supreme court, upon the application of the city or of any person entitled to or claiming to be interested in the lands, tenements or hereditaments for which such awards have been made, or any part thereof, shall either direct the same to be retained by the comptroller, or to be paid into the supreme court until the title thereto or the respective interests and estates of all parties therein shall be determined by the court. Upon such application the court may take the proofs and testimony of the claimant or claimants or parties interested in the lands for which the awards have been made or refer the matter to a referee for such purpose.






*§ 5-458 Awards; deposits of; payment of, to persons not entitled thereto.* ::


a. Whenever the owner, in whose favor any awards shall be made, shall be a minor or incompetent or absent from the city, and also in all cases where the name of the owner shall not be set forth or mentioned in the final decree, or where such owner, being named therein, cannot be found, or where there are adverse or conflicting claims to the money awarded as compensation, it shall be lawful for the comptroller to pay such awards made in the final decree into the supreme court, to be invested, secured, disposed of and paid out as such court shall direct. Such payment shall be as valid and effectual in all respects as if made to such owners according to their just rights, if they had been known and had all been present, of full age and competent.

b. In all cases, however, where any such award, which shall be made in the final decree in favor of any person whether named or not named in the final decree of the court, shall be paid to any person or persons whomsoever, when the same shall of right belong, and ought to have been paid to some other person or persons, it shall be lawful for the person or persons, to whom the same ought to have been paid, to sue for and recover the same, with lawful interest and costs of suit, from the person or persons, to whom the same shall have been paid, as so much money had and received to the use of the plaintiff or plaintiffs, by the person or persons, respectively, to whom the same shall have been so paid, and the final decree of the court, with proof of payment, shall be conclusive evidence of such payment in such suit.
