      shall be the total of the following items:
        1.  For the first one-fifth mile or fraction thereof, or the first one
      minute of waiting time or fraction thereof, or the combination  thereof,
      sixty cents.
        2.  For  each  additional  one-fifth  mile  or  fraction  thereof,  or

      combination thereof, ten cents.
        3. Fifty cents for each trunk.
        4. All bridge and tunnel and ferry tolls.
        5.  There  shall  be  no  charge  for  personal  luggage  or for other
      belongings of the passengers transported in the interior of the taxicab.
        b. Hereafter, and notwithstanding the rates set forth in  paragraph  a
      of  this  section,  the commission shall prescribe, revise and otherwise
      regulate reasonable rates of fare which may be charged and collected for
      each type of service rendered.
        c. In determining the rates of fare, the commission may  consider  all
      facts  which  in  its judgment have a bearing on a proper determination,
      with due regard among other things to the time and distance  of  travel,
      to  the character of the service provided, to the gross revenues derived
      from operation, to  the  net  return  derived  from  operation,  to  the
      expenses  of  operation including the income of drivers or operators, to
      the return upon capital actually expended and the  necessity  of  making
      reservations  out of income for surplus and contingencies, to the number
      of passengers transported, to the effect of fares upon the public and in
      relation to the fares for other forms of public transportation,  and  to
      the fares and practices with respect to similar services in other cities
      of the United States.
        d. No determination by the commission changing the rates of fare shall
      be  made  except  after a public hearing before the commission, at which
      evidence shall be taken.
        e. At any public hearing involving a change in the rates of fare,  the
      burden  of proof to show that existing rates are not reasonable shall be
      upon such segment of the business or industry affected by  this  chapter
      as is involved in the change in rates.
        f.  The  costs reasonably attributable to a public hearing involving a
      change in the rates of fare, including the expenses  of  the  commission
      and  the  compensation  of  its officers, agents and employees, shall be
      charged to and paid by such segment of the business or industry affected
      by this chapter as is involved in the change in rates.
