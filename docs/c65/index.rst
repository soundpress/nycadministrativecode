        §  2302.  Reports  of commission. a. All proceedings of the commission
      and all documents and records in its possession shall be public  records
      and the commission shall make an annual report to the city council on or
      before  the  second  Monday  of January in each year. Such annual report
      shall  contain  information  regarding  complaints   received   by   the
      commission from the public, including, but not limited to, complaints of
      overcharging,   as   well  as  enforcement  actions  undertaken  by  the
      commission, whether the enforcement action was dismissed or settled,  or
      if  a  penalty  was  imposed  by  the  commission  on the subject of the
      enforcement action. The information regarding enforcement actions  shall
      include,  but not be limited to, enforcement actions relating to illegal
      street  hails,  unlicensed  vehicles,  overcharging,   and   toll   lane
      infractions.  The  complaint and enforcement action information shall be
      disaggregated by the type of license held by the person or entity who is
      the subject of the complaint or action and the month  during  which  the
      complaint  was  received  or  enforcement action undertaken. Enforcement
      actions shall be further disaggregated by  the  subject  matter  of  the
      action  and  geographic location. Complaint information shall be further
      disaggregated to the extent practicable by the  subject  matter  of  the
      complaint.  In  addition to inclusion in the commission's annual report,
      the disaggregated complaint and enforcement information shall be  posted
      on  the  commission's  website updated no less than monthly. Information
      shall be published in a manner that does  not  identify  the  individual
      parties  involved  in  the  actions  reported  upon in this section. The
      chairman of the city council committee on transportation may at any time
      direct the commission or the chairman of the commission to appear before
      the committee to give testimony pertaining thereto, and  to  furnish  to
      the members of the council any reports deemed necessary.

      immediately  preceding quarter regarding the average wait time to secure
      a vehicle inspection at the commission's assigned inspection facility as
      required under the rules of  the  commission.  Such  report  shall  also
      contain  the number of instances when the wait for an inspection exceeds
      four weeks. All information shall be disaggregated by vehicle type.

      transportation of persons by licensed vehicles for  hire  in  the  city,
      pursuant  to  provisions  of  this chapter. Except as otherwise provided
      herein, charges of violations of the provisions  of  the  administrative
      code  and  rules  promulgated  thereunder  shall  be  adjudicated by the
      administrative tribunal established by the commission  and  governed  by
      the citywide administrative procedure act.

      according to law.
        4.  Taxicab  licenses  represented by medallions which have heretofore
      been surrendered are hereby revoked. Additional taxicab licenses may  be
      issued  from  time  to  time  only  upon  the  enactment  of a local law
      providing therefor. Any nontransferable licenses shall be deemed revoked
      upon the surrender by or death of the holder thereof.
        5. The issuance,  revocation,  suspension  of  licenses  for  drivers,
      chauffeurs,  owners or operators of vehicles, other than licenses issued
      pursuant to state law, and for taxicab brokers and the establishment  of
      qualifying standards required for such licensees.
        6.   Requirements   of  standards  of  safety,  and  design,  comfort,
      convenience, noise and air  pollution  control  and  efficiency  in  the

      commission may determine.
        9.  The  development  and  effectuation  of  a  broad public policy of
      transportation affected by this chapter as it relates to forms of public
      transportation in the city, including innovation and experimentation  in
      relation to type and design of equipment, modes of service and manner of
      operation,  which  for  limited purposes and limited periods of time may
      depart from the requirements otherwise established for licensed vehicles
      pursuant to this chapter.
        10. Assistance to the business and industry of  public  transportation
      affected  by  this  chapter  in aid of the continuation, development and
      improvement of service and the safety and  convenience  of  the  public,
      including assistance in securing federal and state grants.
        11.  The  formulation,  promulgation  and  effectuation  of  rules and
      regulations reasonably designed to carry out  the  purposes,  terms  and
      provisions of this chapter.
        c.  (1)  The  commission  shall  create  an administrative tribunal to
      adjudicate charges of violation of provisions of the administrative code
      and rules promulgated thereunder. The commission shall have the power to
      enforce its tribunal's decisions and orders  imposing  civil  penalties,
      not  to  exceed ten thousand dollars for each respondent, for violations
      relating to unlicensed vehicles  for  hire  and  unlicensed  drivers  of
      vehicles  for  hire  **and  for  violations relating to the operation of
    
      commuter  van  services  without  authorization  and  the  operation  of
      unlicensed  commuter  vans  and  unlicensed  drivers  of  commuter  vans
      pursuant to chapter five of title nineteen of the administrative  code**
      as  if  they  were  money  judgments,  without court proceedings, in the
      following manner:  Any  such  decision  or  order  of  the  commission's
      administrative   tribunal   imposing   a   civil  penalty,  whether  the
      adjudication was had by hearing or  upon  default  or  otherwise,  shall
      constitute a judgment rendered by the commission which may be entered in
      the civil court of New York or any other place provided for the entry of
      civil judgments within the state. Before a judgment based upon a default
      may  be  so entered the commission or administrative tribunal shall have
      first notified the respondent by first class mail in such  form  as  the
      commission  may  direct:  (i)  of  the default and order and the penalty
      imposed; (ii) that a judgment will be entered in the civil court of  the
      city  of  New  York  or any other place provided by law for the entry of
      civil judgments within the state of New York; and (iii)  that  entry  of
      such  judgment  may  be avoided by requesting a stay of default for good
      cause shown and either requesting a hearing or entering a plea  pursuant
      to  **the  rules  of  the  commission  or administrative tribunal within
      thirty days of** the mailing of such notice.
        * So in original. (**text between** deleted without brackets).
        (2) The commission or tribunal shall not enter any decision  or  order
      pursuant  to  paragraph  one  of  this  subdivision unless the notice of
      violation shall have been served in the same manner as is prescribed for
      service of process by article three of the civil practice law and  rules
      or  article  three of the business corporation law except that: (a) with
      respect to any notice of violation which alleges  the  operation  of  an
      unlicensed  vehicle for hire the operator of such vehicle who is not the
      owner thereof but who uses or operates such vehicle with the  permission
      of  the  owner,  express  or implied, shall be deemed to be the agent of
      such owner to receive such notice of violation and service made pursuant
      to this paragraph on such operator shall also be  deemed  to  be  lawful
      service  upon such owner; or (b) with respect to any notice of violation
      which alleges the operation of an unauthorized commuter van  service  or
      an  unlicensed  commuter van, the operator of the vehicle giving rise to
      such violation who is not the owner of such commuter van service or such
      commuter van, as applicable, but who uses or operates such vehicle  with
      the  permission,  express  or implied, of the owner of such commuter van
      service or such commuter van, as the case may be, shall be deemed to  be
      the  agent  of  the  owner of such commuter van service or such commuter
      van, as the case may be, to receive such notice  of  violation.  Service
      made  pursuant  to this paragraph on such operator shall be deemed to be
      lawful service upon the owner of such commuter van service  or  commuter
      van, as applicable.
        d.  No  resolution of approval of a pilot program shall be approved by
      the commission unless such resolution is posted in a prominent  location
      on  the  commission's  website  and  electronically  transmitted to each
      member of the commission at least  three  calendar  days,  exclusive  of
      Sundays,  prior  to  the  commission's  vote  to  approve or reject such
      resolution of approval; provided, however, that revisions may be made to
      a resolution of approval for a pilot  program  posted  online  and  sent
      electronically  in conformity with this subdivision at any time prior to
      a vote on such resolution if such revisions are approved by all  members
      of the commission by unanimous consent.

        §  2304. Rates. a. The amount to be charged and collected for the hire
      of a taxicab for one or more passengers within  the  city  of  New  York
      shall be the total of the following items:
        1.  For the first one-fifth mile or fraction thereof, or the first one
      minute of waiting time or fraction thereof, or the combination  thereof,
      sixty cents.
        2.  For  each  additional  one-fifth  mile  or  fraction  thereof,  or
      seventy-two  seconds  of  waiting  time  or  fraction  thereof,  or  the
      combination thereof, ten cents.
        3. Fifty cents for each trunk.
        4. All bridge and tunnel and ferry tolls.
        5.  There  shall  be  no  charge  for  personal  luggage  or for other

        b. Hereafter, and notwithstanding the rates set forth in  paragraph  a
      of  this  section,  the commission shall prescribe, revise and otherwise
      regulate reasonable rates of fare which may be charged and collected for
      each type of service rendered.
        c. In determining the rates of fare, the commission may  consider  all
      facts  which  in  its judgment have a bearing on a proper determination,
      with due regard among other things to the time and distance  of  travel,
      to  the character of the service provided, to the gross revenues derived
      from operation, to  the  net  return  derived  from  operation,  to  the
      expenses  of  operation including the income of drivers or operators, to
      the return upon capital actually expended and the  necessity  of  making
      reservations  out of income for surplus and contingencies, to the number
      of passengers transported, to the effect of fares upon the public and in
      relation to the fares for other forms of public transportation,  and  to
      the fares and practices with respect to similar services in other cities
      of the United States.
        d. No determination by the commission changing the rates of fare shall
      be  made  except  after a public hearing before the commission, at which
      evidence shall be taken.
        e. At any public hearing involving a change in the rates of fare,  the
      burden  of proof to show that existing rates are not reasonable shall be
      upon such segment of the business or industry affected by  this  chapter
      as is involved in the change in rates.
        f.  The  costs reasonably attributable to a public hearing involving a
      change in the rates of fare, including the expenses  of  the  commission
      and  the  compensation  of  its officers, agents and employees, shall be
      charged to and paid by such segment of the business or industry affected
      by this chapter as is involved in the change in rates.
