        §  2302.  Reports  of commission. a. All proceedings of the commission
      and all documents and records in its possession shall be public  records
      and the commission shall make an annual report to the city council on or
      before  the  second  Monday  of January in each year. Such annual report
      shall  contain  information  regarding  complaints   received   by   the
      commission from the public, including, but not limited to, complaints of
      overcharging,   as   well  as  enforcement  actions  undertaken  by  the
      commission, whether the enforcement action was dismissed or settled,  or
      if  a  penalty  was  imposed  by  the  commission  on the subject of the
      enforcement action. The information regarding enforcement actions  shall
      include,  but not be limited to, enforcement actions relating to illegal
      street  hails,  unlicensed  vehicles,  overcharging,   and   toll   lane
      infractions.  The  complaint and enforcement action information shall be
      disaggregated by the type of license held by the person or entity who is
      the subject of the complaint or action and the month  during  which  the
      complaint  was  received  or  enforcement action undertaken. Enforcement
      actions shall be further disaggregated by  the  subject  matter  of  the
      action  and  geographic location. Complaint information shall be further
      disaggregated to the extent practicable by the  subject  matter  of  the
      complaint.  In  addition to inclusion in the commission's annual report,
      the disaggregated complaint and enforcement information shall be  posted
      on  the  commission's  website updated no less than monthly. Information
      shall be published in a manner that does  not  identify  the  individual
      parties  involved  in  the  actions  reported  upon in this section. The
      chairman of the city council committee on transportation may at any time
      direct the commission or the chairman of the commission to appear before
      the committee to give testimony pertaining thereto, and  to  furnish  to
      the members of the council any reports deemed necessary.
        b. The commission shall make a quarterly report to the city council on
      or  before  the  second Monday of March, June, September and December in
      each year. Each such quarterly report shall contain information for  the
      immediately  preceding quarter regarding the average wait time to secure
      a vehicle inspection at the commission's assigned inspection facility as
      required under the rules of  the  commission.  Such  report  shall  also
      contain  the number of instances when the wait for an inspection exceeds
      four weeks. All information shall be disaggregated by vehicle type.
