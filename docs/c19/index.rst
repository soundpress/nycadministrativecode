b. In the event that a publicly mapped street that is used for vehicular or vehicular and pedestrian access, for which vehicular access is fully closed for more than one hundred eighty consecutive days, the commissioner shall issue or cause to be issued a community reassessment, impact and amelioration (CRIA) statement that has been approved by the commissioner or other government entity initiating the street closure which shall be delivered to both the community board and the council member in whose district the street is located on or before the two hundred tenth day of the closure. Such CRIA statement shall contain the following: the objectives of the closure and the reasons why the continued street closure is necessary to attain those objectives, which in the case of a closure initiated by a local law enforcement agency for security reasons shall be satisfied by a statement from the local law enforcement agency that the street has been closed and will remain closed for security reasons; identification of the least expensive alternative means of attaining those objectives and the costs of such alternatives, or a statement and explanation as to the unavailability of such alternatives, which in the case of a closure initiated by a local law enforcement agency for security reasons shall be satisfied by a statement from the law enforcement agency that there are no alternative means available; how the continued street closure will impact access and traffic flow to and within the surrounding community, including but not limited to, access to emergency vehicles, residences, businesses, facilities, paratransit transportation and school bus services; and any recommendations to mitigate adverse impact and increase access to and within the area.

No notice of violation shall be issued for the failure to comply with a notice of correction issued pursuant to subparagraph a of paragraph one of this subdivision unless the commissioner has caused a second inspection of the violation to take place within a period of time that commences on the day after the applicable period for correcting such violation expires and ends fourteen days after such day. In addition, the commissioner may send to such owner or other person in control of such newsrack, by electronic mail, photographic evidence of such violation taken at such second inspection. Failure to send such photographic evidence by electronic mail will not result in the dismissal of a notice of violation issued pursuant to any provision of this section.

      (b-1) Failure by an owner or a person in control of a newsrack to comply with subdivision c or d of this section, failure by such owner or person to certify or failure to accurately demonstrate that such owner or person has repainted or used best efforts to remove graffiti and other unauthorized writing, painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions, as required by paragraph one of subdivision e of this section, shall be a violation and shall be subject to the applicable penalties provided in paragraph six of this subdivision. A proceeding to recover any civil penalty authorized by this subparagraph shall be commenced with service on such owner or person of a notice of violation returnable to the board. The commissioner shall not be required to issue a notice of correction before issuing or serving a notice of violation pursuant to this subparagraph.

At the time set for such hearing, or at the date to which such hearing is continued, the board shall receive all evidence relevant to the occurrence or non-occurrence of the specified violation(s), the compliance or noncompliance with any of the provisions of this section, and any other relevant information. Such hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation. Within five business days after the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render a decision, based upon the facts adduced at said hearing, whether any violations of this section have occurred.

The board shall send to the owner or person in control of the newsrack by regular mail, a copy of its decision and order.

   2. (a)    If the board renders a decision upholding the finding of a violation against the respondent upon default or after a hearing held pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, other than a decision finding a violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision e of this section, and the violation is not remedied within seven days of receipt of the decision of the board, the commissioner or his or her designee is authorized to provide for the removal of such newsrack and any contents thereof to a place of safety. For purposes of this subparagraph, a decision shall be deemed to have been received five days from the date on which it was mailed. If such newsrack and any contents thereof are not claimed within thirty days after their removal by a person entitled to their return, they shall be deemed to be abandoned and may be either sold at a public auction after having been advertised in the City Record, the proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for use by the department or another city agency, or otherwise disposed of, and the owner or person in control shall be liable to the City for the costs of removal and storage and shall be subject to a civil penalty pursuant to subparagraph a of paragraph six of subdivision f of this section.

      (b) If the board renders a decision upholding the finding of a violation against the respondent for having failed to certify, or having failed to accurately demonstrate that such respondent repainted or used best efforts to remove graffiti and other unauthorized writing, painting, drawing, or other markings or inscriptions or having failed to comply with any other provision of paragraph one of subdivision e of this section, the board shall impose a penalty in accordance with subparagraph b of paragraph six of this subdivision.

   3. The commissioner may, upon notice, serve an order upon the owner or other person in control of a newsrack requiring such person to remove or cause to be removed such newsrack within seven business days of receipt of such order where such removal is required because the site or location at which such newsrack is placed is used or is to be used for public utility purposes, public transportation, or public safety purposes, or when such newsrack unreasonably interferes with construction activities in nearby or adjacent buildings, or if removal is required in connection with a street widening or other capital project or improvement. If such person does not remove such newsrack within seven business days of receipt of such order, the provisions contained in subparagraphs b and c of paragraph one of this subdivision and subparagraph a of paragraph two of this subdivision regarding issuance of a notice of violation and alternatives for removal, storage, abandonment, disposal, and release, shall apply.

      (b) If any owner or other person in control of a newsrack does not remove such newsrack when directed to do so pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph a of this paragraph, or if circumstances are such that public safety requires the immediate removal of a newsrack and it is not reasonable to give the owner or other person in control of such newsrack notice prior to removal, the commissioner or his or her designee may provide for the removal of such newsrack to a place of safety. Unless an administrative proceeding brought pursuant to subparagraph c of this paragraph has terminated in favor of such owner or other person in control of such newsrack, such owner or other person in control of such newsrack may be charged with the reasonable costs of removal and storage payable prior to the release of such newsrack and the contents thereof.

      (c) If an owner or other person in control of a newsrack fails to comply with a notice issued pursuant to subparagraph a of this paragraph to remove such newsrack, a notice of violation returnable to the board shall be served on such owner or person in control of such newsrack. If the newsrack has been removed by the city pursuant to subparagraph b of this paragraph, such notice of violation shall be served immediately after removal, and, if the return date of the notice of violation is more than five business days after the service of such notice, the board shall, upon the request of the respondent, in person at the office of the board, provide a hearing on such violation prior to such return date and no later than five business days after the date of such request. The hearing shall take place under the provisions set forth in subparagraphs b and c of paragraph one of this subdivision and a decision shall be rendered by the board within five business days after the conclusion of the hearing. If a decision is rendered at such hearing that emergency circumstances did not exist, such newsrack shall be returned within ten days to the location from which it was removed by the commissioner or his or her designee. If a decision is rendered against the respondent upon default or after a hearing that such emergency circumstances existed, such newsrack and the contents thereof shall be released to the owner or other person lawfully entitled to possession. If, after a board decision that removal was proper, such newsrack and any contents thereof are not claimed within thirty days after the date of removal by a person entitled to their return, such newsrack and any contents thereof shall be deemed abandoned and may be either sold at a public auction after having been advertised in the City Record, the proceeds thereof being paid into the general fund, used or converted for use by the department or another city agency, or otherwise disposed of.

   6. (a) Any owner or person in control of a newsrack found to be in violation of any provision of this section shall, after a board decision has been issued upon default or after a hearing, be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of (i) no less than fifty dollars and no more than one hundred dollars for each violation for a specific newsrack of any of the provisions of paragraphs two, three, four or five of subdivision e of this section or paragraph four of subdivision b of this section, except that a person found in violation of any of such provisions after a decision of the board issued on default shall be subject to a penalty of no less than one hundred dollars and no more than five hundred dollars; (ii) no less than five hundred dollars and no more than four thousand dollars for each violation of paragraph one of subdivision c of this section; and (iii) no less than one hundred dollars and no more than five hundred dollars for each violation of paragraphs one, two, three, five, six and seven of subdivision b of this section.

   6. The term "filling" means the deposition, leveling or compacting of organic or inorganic material at or in a vacant lot or land area for a purpose relating to the composition, contour, use, or proposed use of the land or for the purpose of disposing of material removed from another lot or land area.

b. It shall be unlawful for any person to perform or cause, procure, suffer or permit to be performed any land contour work, except as provided in subdivision c hereof, without a written permit from the commissioner.

c. Subdivision b hereof shall not apply:

   1. To land contour work performed in connection with or in the course of the erection of one or more buildings or other structures or in connection with land uses pursuant to a permit therefor issued by the department of buildings, provided however that, (a) such permit specifically authorizes such land contour work, and (b) such land contour work is performed entirely within the lot lines of the building site for which such permit is issued. In such cases where water courses, drainage ditches, conduits or other means of carrying off water exist on the property and are to be altered or relocated, the commissioner of buildings shall consult with the commissioner of environmental protection concerning the means of disposal of surface water prior to issuance of a permit.

   2. to land contour work which consists only of making improvements to a land area on which a one or two-family house already exists and which does not result in any change in the surface runoff pattern of such land area.

   3. To land contour work for which a stormwater construction permit issued by the department of environmental protection is required pursuant to subchapter 2 of chapter 5-A of title 24 of the administrative code.

d. No condition shall be created or maintained as the result of land contour work that will interfere with existing drainage unless a substitute therefor is provided which is satisfactory to the commissioner and the commissioner of environmental protection in accordance with criteria established by such commissioners in consultation with the department of health and mental hygiene. Watercourses, drainage ditches, conduits and other like or unlike means of carrying off water or disposing of surface water shall not be obstructed by refuse, waste, building materials, earth, stones, tree stumps, branches or by any other means that may interfere with surface drainage or cause the impoundment of surface waters either within or without the area on which contour work is performed. All excavations shall be drained and the drainage maintained as long as the excavation continues or remains. Where necessary, pumping shall be used. Fill material shall consist of inert, inorganic matter. It shall be unlawful to deposit garbage, waste paper, lumber or other organic material in land fill. The provisions of this section shall not prevent placement of organic matter for fill by the department of sanitation in locations under the jurisdiction of such department. The commissioner shall have the power, in consultation with the commissioner of buildings to adopt rules concerning the type of material that may be used for fill on land not mapped as park land. The commissioner shall enforce compliance with the provisions hereof, and shall make immediate complaint to the corporation counsel of any violation thereof. In addition, the commissioner of buildings shall similarly enforce compliance with the provisions hereof with respect to any land contour work performed pursuant to a permit issued by the commissioner of buildings, and in addition thereto shall inform the department of any failure to comply with a department of buildings violation order relating to the provisions hereof.

e. 1. Whenever the department shall determine that a condition has been created, or has resulted by reason of land contour work which violates any provision of subdivision (d) hereof, the department may serve an order in the manner prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision upon the owners of the land upon which such condition has been created or has occurred, to correct such condition within the time designated in such order. Upon the owner's failure to comply with any order of the department as and within the time specified therein by such department, such department may perform such work or cause the same to be performed, the cost of which shall be due and payable and shall constitute a lien upon the land to which such order pertains, when the amount thereof shall have been finally computed by such department and an entry of the amount thereof shall have been entered in the office of the city collector in the book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector, within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills, or where no name appears, to the premises addressed to either the owner or agent. If such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to collect and receive interest thereon at the rate that would be applicable to a delinquent tax on such property, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises on which such work was performed. Such charge and interest shall be collected and the lien thereon may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the collection and foreclosure of the lien of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents due and payable to the city, and the provisions of law applicable to the collection and foreclosure of the lien of such taxes, sewer rents, surcharges and water rents shall apply to such charge. The provisions of section 11-307 of the code applicable to the payment of assessments shall also apply to charges heretofore or hereafter established pursuant to this section.

   2. Service of an order upon an owner pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be made personally upon such owner or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of the person whose name appears upon the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner of the premises or as the agent of such owner or as the person designated by the owner to receive the tax bills or, if no such name appears, to the address set forth as the address of the owner in the last recorded deed with respect to such premises.

In addition to the orders specifically referred to in this subchapter, the commissioner shall have the power to issue any other orders which may be necessary or appropriate (i) to enforce compliance with any of the provisions of this subchapter or of section 24-521 of the code, the rules of the department in relation thereto or the terms or conditions of any permit issued pursuant thereto, or (ii) to remedy any condition found to exist on any street which is in violation of any of the provisions of this subchapter or of section 24-521 of the code, the rules of the department in relation thereto or the terms or conditions of any permit issued pursuant thereto. Such orders shall be served in the manner provided by the rules of the department. The commissioner shall afford the persons to whom such order is directed an opportunity to be heard in accordance with the rules of the department.

c. The commissioner may request the corporation counsel to institute any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary to restrain, correct or abate a violation of this subchapter or of section 24-521 of the code or the rules of the department in relation thereto or to compel compliance with any order issued by the commissioner thereunder or with the terms or conditions of any permit issued pursuant to this subchapter.

An owner of real property shall bear the cost for repairing, repaving, installing, reinstalling, constructing or reconstructing any sidewalk flag in front of or abutting his or her property, including but not limited to the intersection quadrant for corner property, deemed to have a substantial defect which is discovered in the course of a city capital construction project or pursuant to the department's prior notification program, wherein the department receives notification of a defective sidewalk flag(s) by any member of the general public or by an employee of the department. However, with respect to substantial defects identified pursuant to the prior notification program, the sidewalk must be deemed to be a hazard prior to the issuance of a violation for any substantial defect contained in subdivision a of this section for any sidewalk flag on such sidewalk. For purposes of this subdivision, a hazard shall exist on any sidewalk where there is any of the following:

   1. one or more sidewalk flags is missing or the sidewalk was never built;

b. All such work shall be done in accordance with such specifications and regulations prescribed by the department.

c. Whenever the department shall determine that a sidewalk flag should be installed, constructed, reconstructed, or repaved, or that a vacant lot should be fenced, or a sunken lot filled or a raised lot cut down, it may order the owner of the property abutting on such sidewalk flag or the owner of such vacant, sunken or raised lot by issuing a violation order to perform such work. Such order shall provide a detailed explanation of the inspection and the sidewalk defects according to sidewalk flags including a detailed diagram of the property and defects by type. The order shall also inform the owner of the existence of the borough offices within the department together with an explanation of the procedures utilized by the borough office as provided for in paragraph eighteen of subdivision a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city charter as well as a complaint and appeal process, including the right to request a reinspection and then the right to appeal by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York and thereafter a petition for appeal and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of account and/or the quality of the work performed under the direction of or by the department as provided herein and the procedures as to how to appeal by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York and how to file a petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of account and/or the quality of the work performed as provided herein and the location, where the forms may be obtained. Such order shall specify the work to be performed, an estimate of the cost of the work to repair the defects and the order shall also specify a reasonable time for compliance, provided that the time for compliance shall be a minimum of 75 days. The department shall, by appropriate regulations, provide for a reinspection by a different departmental inspector than the inspector that conducted the first or original inspection upon request of the property owner to the appropriate borough office. Where appropriate, the department shall notify the property owner of the date of reinspection at least five days prior to the reinspection date. Such inspector conducting the reinspection shall conduct an independent inspection of the property without access to the reports from the first inspection. The inspector conducting the reinspection shall file a new report and the department shall issue a new order to the owner specifying the results of the reinspection with a detailed diagram of the property and defects by type. Such order shall also advise the owner of the procedures utilized by the borough office as provided for in paragraph eighteen of subdivision a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city charter and also of the right to challenge the notice of account and/or the quality of the work performed by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller and thereafter a petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of account and/or the quality of the work performed under the direction of or by the department as provided in sections 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and specify the procedures as to how to appeal by filing a notice of claim with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York and how to file a petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of account and/or the quality of the work performed and the location where the forms may be obtained.

d. If the department has been notified in writing of the existence of a defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed condition of a sidewalk pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 7-201 of the code, and the department determines that such condition constitutes an immediate danger to the public, it may notify the property owner that such condition constitutes an immediate danger to the public and direct such owner to repair same within ten days of the service of the notice.

e. Upon the owner's failure to comply with such order or notice within 75 days of service and filing thereof, or within ten days if such period is fixed by the department pursuant to subdivision d of this section, the department may perform the work or cause same to be performed under the supervision of the department, the cost of which, together with administrative expenses, as determined by the commissioner, but not to exceed twenty percent of the cost of performance, shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner by lien on the property affected or otherwise. Upon entry by the city collector, in the book in which such charges are to be entered, of the amount definitely computed as a statement of account by the department, such debt shall become a lien prior to all liens or encumbrances on such property, other than taxes. An owner shall be deemed to have complied with this subdivision if he or she obtains a permit from the department to perform such work as specified in the order within the time set forth therein and completes such work within ten days thereafter.

f. Service of a notice or order by the department upon an owner pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be made upon such owner or upon his or her designated managing agent personally or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the person whose name appears on the records of the city collector as being the owner of the premises. If the records of the city collector show that a party, other than the owner, has been designated to receive tax bills for such property, the notice shall be mailed to such party as well as to the owner of record, at his or her last known address, or, if it is a multiple dwelling, service upon the owner or managing agent may be made in accordance with section 27-2095 of the code. If the postal service returns the order with a notation that the owner refused to accept delivery of such notice, it may be served by ordinary mail and posted in a conspicuous place on the premises.

g. A copy of such notice or order shall also be filed in the office of the clerk of each county where the property is situated, together with proof of service thereof.

h. Nothing contained in this section shall impair or diminish the power of the city to install, construct, reconstruct, repave or repair sidewalk flags or to fence vacant lots or to fill sunken lots or to cut down raised lots or to enter into contracts with the owners of premises abutting on streets for such installation, construction, reconstruction, repaving or repair of sidewalk flags or fencing of vacant lots or filling of sunken lots, or cutting down of any raised lots, in accordance with the rules of the procurement policy board. Nor shall anything contained in this section affect or impair any act done or right accrued or accruing, or acquired, or liability incurred prior to the effective date of this section, but the same may be enjoyed or asserted as fully and to the same extent as if this section had not been enacted.

i. After the work has been performed or after inspection by the department in the case where the work was performed under the direction of the department a notice of such account, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge, shall be mailed by the city collector, within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or the agent. Such notice shall also inform the addressee of the existence of a complaint and appeal process including the procedures utilized by the borough office as provided for in paragraph eighteen of subdivision a of section twenty-nine hundred three of the New York city charter the right to appeal the amount due and the quality of work performed under the direction of or by the department by filing a notice of a claim with the office of the comptroller of the city of New York and thereafter by filing a petition and commence a proceeding to review and/or correct the notice of such account and/or the quality of the work performed under direction of or by the department as provided in section 19-152.2 and 19-152.3 of the code and the location where the forms may be obtained. The owner shall only be responsible for the cost of reinstalling, constructing, reconstructing, repaving or repairing defective sidewalk flags ordered or directed by the department, not an entire sidewalk if the entire sidewalk lacks defects.

j. If such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge and receive interest thereon, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry.

   (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, interest shall be charged at the rate of interest applicable to such property for real property taxes pursuant to section 11-224 of the code.

   (2) With respect to any parcel on which the annual tax is not more than two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars, other than a parcel which consists of vacant or unimproved land, interest shall be charged at the rate determined pursuant to subdivision p or at the rate of eight and one-half percent whichever is lower.

k. Such charge and interest shall be collected and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the collection and foreclosure of the lien of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water charges due and payable to the city, and the provisions of chapter four of title eleven of the code shall apply to such charge and the interest thereon and the lien thereof.

l. In addition to collecting the charge for the cost of installation, construction, repaving, reconstruction and repair of sidewalk, fencing of a vacant lot, filling of a sunken lot and/or cutting down any raised lot as a lien, the city may maintain a civil action for recovery of such charge against a property owner who is responsible under this section for such work in the first instance, provided, however, that in the event that the department performs the work without duly notifying such person in the manner prescribed in subdivision f, the cost to the city of performing such work shall be prima facie evidence of the reasonable cost thereof.

m. Upon application in writing of either (i) an owner of real property which is improved by a one, two, three, four, five or six family house: or (ii) an owner of real property which has an assessed valuation of no more than thirty thousand dollars, upon which a charge in excess of two hundred fifty dollars but not in excess of five thousand dollars has been entered pursuant to this section, the commissioner of finance may agree with the owner to divide the charge into four annual installments. Each installment shall be as nearly equal as may be. The first installment thereof shall be due and payable upon approval of the application and each succeeding installment shall be due and payable on the next ensuing anniversary date of the date of entry of the charge, together with interest thereon from the date of entry at the rate determined pursuant to subdivision p, or at the rate of eight and one-half percent per annum, whichever is lower. The commissioner may require owners of parcels making application pursuant to this subdivision to furnish satisfactory proof of their eligibility. In the event that the owner fails to make payment of any installment within thirty days of the due date, the commissioner may declare such installment agreement to be null and void and the balance of the charge shall become immediately due and payable with interest at the rate prescribed in subdivision j of this section to be calculated from the date of entry to the date of payment. The installments not yet due with interest to date of payment may be paid at any time. The city may not enforce a lien against any owner who has entered into an agreement with the commissioner of finance pursuant to this section provided that he or she is not in default thereunder. No installment shall be a lien or deemed an encumbrance upon the title to real property charged until it becomes due as herein provided. In the event that the city shall acquire, by condemnation or otherwise, any property upon which installments are not due, such installments shall become due as of the date of acquisition of title by the city and shall be set off against any award that may be made for the property acquired, with interest to the date of acquisition of title.

n. All orders or notices served by the commissioner in connection with the installation, construction, reconstruction, repavement or repair of sidewalks, fencing of vacant lots, filling of sunken lots or cutting down of raised lots and all charges arising out of the performance of such work by the department subsequent to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven are hereby legalized, validated, ratified and confirmed as though such orders, notices and charges were made pursuant to this section.

o. [Repealed.]

p. On or before the first day of June, nineteen hundred eighty-six, and on or before the first day of June of each succeeding year, the director of the office of management and budget shall determine and certify the city's cost of debt service, expressed as a percentage and rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a percentage point and shall transmit copies of such certification to the city council and the commissioner of finance. The percentage so determined and certified shall be the rate of interest applicable for purposes of paragraph (2) of subdivision j and subdivision m during the ensuing fiscal year of the city, provided, however, that for the period beginning on February third, nineteen hundred eighty-five and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-six, the applicable rate of interest shall be eight and one-half percent per annum. Any rate determined pursuant to this subdivision shall apply to charges, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect. For the purposes of this subdivision, the city's cost of debt service shall be the average rate of interest paid by the city during the first ten months of the fiscal year in which the determination is made on general obligation bonds issued by the city during such period with a maturity of four years or if no general obligation bonds with a maturity of four years are issued during such period, on general obligation bonds with a maturity of no less than three nor more than five years.

q. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, the amount charged an owner for sidewalk reconstruction performed or caused to be performed by the department in connection with a city capital construction project for street or sewer reconstruction shall be determined according to the average city expenditure for such sidewalk reconstruction projects in the borough where such reconstruction is performed. Such average expenditure shall be computed by the commissioner.

r. The department shall keep record of all complaints submitted and work ordered and performed under this section and shall issue a public report for a minimum of three years containing such information including the number of complaints heard each year according to category, the number of reinspections performed, and the dispositions of such reinspections.

The form and content of such notice of hearing shall be prescribed by the director, and shall contain a warning to advise the person so pleading that failure to appear on the date designated, or on any subsequent adjourned date, shall be deemed, for all purposes, an admission of liability, and that a default judgment may be rendered.

(a) 1.    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the parking violations bureau is hereby authorized and empowered to establish a demonstration program imposing monetary liability on the owner of a vehicle for failure of an operator thereof to comply with traffic-control indications in accordance with the provisions of this section. The department of transportation, for purposes of implementation of such program, shall be authorized to install and operate traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring devices at no more than one hundred fifty intersections at any one time.

   2. Such demonstration program shall utilize necessary technologies to ensure, to the extent practicable, that photographs produced by such traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring systems shall not include images that identify the driver, the passengers, or the contents of the vehicle. Provided, however, that no notice of liability issued pursuant to this section shall be dismissed solely because a photograph or photographs allow for the identification of the contents of a vehicle, provided that such city has made a reasonable effort to comply with the provisions of this paragraph.

(b) 1. The owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section if such vehicle was used or operated with the permission of the owner, express or implied, in violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law, and such violation is evidenced by information obtained from a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system; provided, however, that no owner of a vehicle shall be liable for a penalty imposed pursuant to this section where the operator of such vehicle has been convicted of the underlying violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.

   2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no owner of a vehicle shall be subject to a monetary fine imposed pursuant to this section if the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle without the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication. For purposes of this subdivision, there shall be a presumption that the operator of such vehicle was operating such vehicle with the consent of the owner at the time such operator failed to obey a traffic-control indication.

(c) For purposes of this section, "owner" shall mean any person, corporation, partnership, firm, agency, association, lessor, or organization who at the time of the issuance of a notice of violation in which a vehicle is operated:

   (1) is the beneficial or equitable owner of such vehicle; or

   (2) has title to such vehicle; or

   (3) is the registrant or co-registrant of such vehicle which is registered with the department of motor vehicles of this state or any other state, territory, district, province nation or other jurisdiction; or

   (4) uses such vehicle in its vehicle renting and/or leasing business; or

   (5) is an owner of such vehicle as defined by section one hundred twenty-eight or subdivision (a) of section twenty-one hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.

(d) For purposes of this section, "traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system" shall mean a device installed to work in conjunction with a traffic-control signal which, during operation, automatically produces two or more photographs, two or more microphotographs, a videotape or other recorded images of each vehicle at the time it is used or operated in violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.

(e) A certificate, sworn to or affirmed by a technician employed by the department, or a facsimile thereof, based upon inspection of photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images produced by a traffic-control signal photo violation-monitoring system, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein. Any photographs, microphotographs, videotape or other recorded images evidencing such a violation shall be available for inspection in any proceeding to adjudicate the liability for such violation imposed pursuant to this section.

(f) An owner liable for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section shall be liable for monetary penalties in accordance with a schedule of fines and penalties to be promulgated by such bureau. The liability of the owner pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty dollars for each violation; provided however that such bureau may provide for an additional penalty not in excess of twenty-five dollars for each violation for the failure to respond to a notice of liability within the prescribed time period. Such bureau shall adjudicate liability imposed by this section.

(g) An imposition of liability under this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator and shall not be made part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage.

(h) 1. A notice of liability shall be sent by first class mail to each person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section. Personal service on the owner shall not be required. A manual or automatic record of mailing prepared in the ordinary course of business shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein.

   2. A notice of liability shall contain the name and address of the person alleged to be liable as an owner for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section, the registration number of the vehicle involved in such violation, the location where such violation took place, the date and time of such violation and the identification number of the camera which recorded the violation or other document locator number.

   3. The notice of liability shall contain information advising the person charged of the manner and the time in which he or she may contest the liability alleged in the notice. Such notice of liability shall also contain a warning to advise the persons charged that failure to contest in the manner and time provided shall be deemed an admission of liability and that a default judgment may be entered thereon.

   4. The notice of liability shall be prepared and mailed by the bureau or its designee.

(i) If an owner receives a notice of liability pursuant to this section for any time period during which the vehicle was reported to the police department as having been stolen, it shall be a valid defense to an allegation of liability for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time the violation occurred and had not been recovered by such time. For purposes of asserting the defense provided by this subdivision it shall be sufficient that a certified copy of the police report on the stolen vehicle be sent by first class mail, return receipt requested, to such bureau.

(j) If the owner liable for a violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law pursuant to this section was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the violation, the owner may maintain an action for indemnification against the operator.

(k) An appeal of an adjudication of liability pursuant to this section may be taken in accordance with the provisions of section 19-208.

   2. Failure to comply with subparagraph B or paragraph one of this subdivision shall render the owner liable for the penalty prescribed in this section.

   3. Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this subdivision, the lessee of such vehicle on the date of such violation shall be deemed to be the owner of such vehicle for purposes of this section, shall be subject to liability for such violation pursuant to this section and shall be sent a notice of liability pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section.

(m) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle for any violation of subdivision (d) of section eleven hundred eleven of the vehicle and traffic law.

(n) On or before September 1, 1989, and every four months thereafter, until such time as the demonstration program authorized in subdivision (a) hereof shall be fully operational, the commissioner of transportation shall submit a written report to the council on the status of said demonstration program. Such report shall include, but not be limited to, the locations selected for inclusion in the demonstration program and the cost to the city, both individually and collectively, of each location included in such demonstration project.

The commission may revoke any driver's license for nonuse, in the event it shall determine that the driver has not worked at least twenty-five days as a licensed driver in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which such determination is made, provided that such failure to work as a licensed driver shall not have been caused by strike, riot, war or other public catastrophe. However, in the event that it is shown to the commission by competent proof that a driver has been disabled through illness, his or her license shall not be revoked because of such nonuse as provided in this subdivision.

j. Fees shall be paid by each applicant for a driver's license, as determined by the commission, but not to exceed the following: For each original one-year license $84.00. For renewal of a one year period $84.00. The fee for an original license or a renewal thereof shall be paid at the time of filing the applications and shall not be refunded in the event of disapproval of the application. An additional fee not exceeding twenty-five dollars shall be paid for each license issued to replace a lost or mutilated license. There shall be an additional fee of twenty-five dollars for late filing of a license renewal application where such late filing is permitted by the commission.

k. Every driver who has obtained a license pursuant to this section shall comply with the rules and regulations promulgated by the commission for drivers of the type of vehicle for which the driver is licensed.

l. The commission may, after a hearing, suspend or revoke any driver's license for failure to comply with any provision of this chapter applicable to licensed drivers or for failure to comply with the commission's rules and regulations.

m. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the commission shall not issue a commuter van driver's license to an applicant unless the applicant: (1) has been fingerprinted for the purpose of securing criminal history records from the state division of criminal justice services for which the applicant shall pay any processing fee required by the state division of criminal justice services; (2) satisfies the commission that such applicant is fit and able to drive the commuter van for which the license is sought; (3) possesses a commercial driver's license which pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law is valid for the operation of such commuter van for the transportation of passengers for-hire; (4) has met the qualifications set forth in article nineteen-A of the vehicle and traffic law for the operation of a bus as defined in such article; and (5) has not engaged in any conduct that would be a basis for suspension or revocation of such license pursuant to rules promulgated by the commission.

n. The commission shall approve or disapprove an application for the issuance of a commuter van driver's license within one hundred eighty days after the completed application is filed. The failure to approve or disapprove such application within such time shall be deemed a disapproval of such application.

o. Every commuter van driver's license shall be issued on the condition that the applicant possesses a commercial driver's license and complies with article nineteen-A of the vehicle and traffic law as described in paragraphs three and four of subdivision m of this section during the time that such commuter van driver's license is in effect. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, suspension or revocation of such commercial driver's license pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law or noncompliance with article nineteen-A of the vehicle and traffic law shall render the commuter van driver's license suspended on and after the date of the suspension or revocation of such commercial driver's license or noncompliance with such article nineteen-A and during the period of such suspension revocation or noncompliance, and any person who drives a commuter van that is required to be licensed pursuant to section 19-504 of this chapter during the period of such suspension revocation or noncompliance shall be deemed to be driving a commuter van without a license required by this section.

p. Any commuter van driver's license issued pursuant to this section shall be revoked after the holder of such license has had an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with procedures to be established by the commission and such holder is found to have failed to comply with paragraph two of subdivision a of section 19-529.1 of this chapter three times within a period of six months.

q. Not more than one hundred eighty days following the enactment of this subdivision, the commission shall develop and commence a program to notify drivers of all vehicles licensed by the commission that facilitating sex trafficking with a vehicle is illegal. Such program shall inform such drivers of the specific laws defining and proscribing such facilitation, including the provisions of this section and section 19-507 of this chapter, and of article 230 of the penal law, and shall inform such drivers of the civil and criminal penalties associated with such facilitation, including but not limited to monetary penalties, license revocation and incarceration. Such program shall also provide information to such drivers about the resources available to assist victims of sex trafficking. Such program shall also inform such drivers that they may not refuse fares solely based on the appearance of an individual and that it is unlawful to refuse a fare based upon an individual's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender, whether or not an individual's gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression is different from that traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to an individual at birth, as set forth in chapter one of title eight of this code. Such program may be presented through live instruction, video or an interactive computer course, and shall be updated regularly to reflect changes in law or other relevant circumstances. Completion of such program shall be a requirement for initial licensure and subsequent license renewal for such drivers, except that any driver who has completed such program at least once may subsequently satisfy the requirements of this subdivision, at the discretion of the commission, by reviewing written materials, to be developed by the commission, that contain the information in such program. All drivers licensed by the commission shall be required to certify that they have completed such program or received and reviewed such written materials.

r. Any procedures established by the commission to determine the ability of an applicant for a universal driver’s license to speak and understand English shall not include a written examination.








*§ 19-506 [Regulations and enforcement.]* ::


a. Regulations and Enforcement. Except as provided by section 19-512.1, the commission may impose reasonable fines and/or suspend or revoke any license issued by the commission where the holder has failed to comply with or has willfully or knowingly violated any of the provisions of this chapter or a rule or regulation of the commission after adjudication of such violation by the administrative tribunal established by the commission in accordance with section 2303 of the New York city charter.

b. 1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this subdivision, any person who shall permit another to operate or who shall knowingly operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle as a taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible van, commuter van, HAIL vehicle or for-hire vehicle in the city, without first having obtained or knowing that another has obtained a license for such vehicle pursuant to the provisions of section 19-504 of this chapter, shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction in the criminal court shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars or more than two thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than sixty days, or both such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph shall apply to the owner of such vehicle and, if different, to the operator of such vehicle.

   2. Any person who shall permit another to operate or who shall knowingly operate or offer to operate for hire any vehicle licensed as a taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible van, HAIL vehicle or for-hire vehicle in the city in a manner that is beyond the scope of the activities permitted by such vehicle's license shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction in the criminal court shall be punished by a fine of not less than four hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or imprisonment for not more than sixty days or both such fine and imprisonment. This paragraph shall apply to the owner of such vehicle and, if different, to the operator of such vehicle.

   3. Where a violation of this chapter or any rules promulgated thereunder is committed using a vehicle which is owned by a rental vehicle company and has been rented or leased by such rental vehicle company, it shall be an affirmative defense that the rental vehicle company did not know or have any reason to know that the person to whom it was rented or leased would operate or offer to operate for hire such vehicle as a taxicab, coach, wheelchair accessible van or for-hire vehicle in the city. For purposes of this subdivision, a "rental vehicle company" shall be defined as any person or organization or any subsidiary or affiliate, including a franchisee, in the business of providing rental vehicles to the public.

c. (1)    No person shall operate or permit to be operated any vehicle bearing the words "hack," "taxi," "taxicab," "cab," "coach," "for hire vehicle," "livery," "limousine," "commuter van service," "van service," "commuter van," "van" or other designation of similar import unless the vehicle is licensed as a taxicab, coach, for-hire vehicle, or commuter van, as appropriate, and the driver has an appropriate driver's license under this chapter, and in the case of a commuter van service, such person has an authorization to operate a commuter van service nor shall any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a taxi, taxicab, hack or coach service unless he or she holds a vehicle license and medallion for each vehicle used therefor, nor shall any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a "limousine service," "livery service," a "for-hire vehicle service," or other similar designation unless a for-hire vehicle license is in effect for each vehicle used therefor, nor shall any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a "commuter van service," "van service," "commuter van," "van" or other designation of similar import unless such person is authorized to operate a commuter van service and a commuter van license is in effect for each vehicle used therefor as required by this chapter, nor shall any person advertise or hold himself or herself out as doing business as a wheelchair accessible van service or other similar designation unless a wheelchair accessible van license is in effect for each vehicle used therefor.

   (2) Any person required to obtain a license under this chapter shall conspicuously state in all print and broadcast advertising, with respect to such licensed activity, the vehicle license number and that the activity is licensed by the commission; provided, however, that as applied to the owner of a for-hire vehicle base station, or wheelchair accessible van base station, such license number shall be the number of the license issued to such base station; provided further, that the requirement of this subdivision respecting the display of vehicle license numbers in print and broadcast advertising shall not apply to any owner of five or more taxicabs. No person who is required to obtain authorization to operate a commuter van service under this chapter shall advertise in print or in a broadcast medium the activity for which authorization is required without conspicuously stating in such advertising the commuter van service authorization number and that the activity is licensed by the commission.

d. Any person, other than a person holding a driver's license issued pursuant to section 19-505 and a New York state class A, B, C or E license, neither of which is revoked or suspended, who drives or operates for hire a licensed vehicle in the city except a commuter van, shall be guilty of a violation, and upon conviction in the criminal court, shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for a term not exceeding thirty days, or both such fine and imprisonment.

e. (1) In addition to or as an alternative to the penalties provided for the violation of the provisions of paragraph one of subdivision b or subdivision d of this section, any person who shall violate such provisions shall, for the first violation, be liable for a civil penalty of one thousand five hundred dollars, and for the second violation committed within a thirty six month period, for a civil penalty of two thousand dollars.

   (2) As an alternative to the penalties provided for the violation of the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision b or subdivision c of this section, any person who shall violate such provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two hundred dollars nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation.

   (3) A proceeding to impose a civil penalty prescribed in paragraphs one or two of this subdivision or in subdivision f of this section shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation returnable before the commission or an administrative tribunal of the commission. The commission or such tribunal, after a hearing as provided by the rules of the commission or its successor agency, shall have the power to enforce its decisions and orders imposing such civil penalties as if they were money judgments pursuant to subdivision c of section two thousand three hundred three of the charter.

f. As an alternative to the penalties provided for the violation of subdivision c of this section, the commission, after notice and hearing, shall be authorized to impose the civil penalties provided in this subdivision upon any person found to have advertised in print or in a broadcast medium in violation of such subdivision, provided, however, that such civil penalties may be imposed only when such person was not licensed by the commission at the time of such violation. Such penalties shall be levied for each broadcast in violation of such subdivision and shall be not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred fifty dollars for each such broadcast. Such penalties for printed advertisements shall be levied for each publication and shall be determined based on the period of time the publication in which the advertisement appears remains current. The current period shall be determined as that time when a publication is initially offered for sale or distribution until the period when the next dated publication is offered for sale or distribution. In no case shall this period be less than twenty-four hours. If the current period is: daily, such penalty shall be not less than one hundred dollars nor more than five hundred dollars per day; weekly, such penalty shall be not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than seven hundred fifty dollars; greater than one week and not more than one month, such penalty shall be not less than seven hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars; and greater than one month, such penalty shall be not less than one thousand dollars nor more than two thousand dollars.

g. The commission shall undertake a public awareness campaign advising the public to patronize only licensed taxicabs and for-hire vehicles and, when selecting a taxicab or for-hire vehicle from an advertisement, to look for the commission license number in any such advertisement.

h. (1)    Any officer or employee of the commission designated by the chairperson of the commission and any police officer may seize any vehicle which he or she has probable cause to believe is operated or offered to be operated without a vehicle license in violation of paragraph one of subdivision b of this section or without an appropriate vehicle license for such operation in violation of paragraph two of subdivision b or of subdivision c or subdivision k of this section. Therefore, either the commission or an administrative tribunal of the commission at a proceeding commenced in accordance with subdivision e of this section, or the criminal court, as provided in this section, shall determine whether a vehicle seized pursuant to this subdivision was operated or offered to be operated in violation of any such subdivision. The commission shall have the power to promulgate regulations concerning the seizure and release of vehicles and may provide in such regulations for reasonable fees for the removal and storage of such vehicles. Unless the charge of violating subdivision b, c or k of this section is dismissed, no vehicle seized pursuant to this subdivision shall be released until all fees for removal and storage and the applicable fine or civil penalty have been paid or a bond has been posted in a form and amount satisfactory to the commission, except as is otherwise provided for vehicles subject to forfeiture pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision.

   (2) In addition to any other penalties provided in this section, if the owner is convicted in the criminal court of, or found liable in accordance with subdivision e of this section for, a violation of paragraphs one or two of subdivision b or of subdivision c or subdivision k of this section two or more times, and all of such violations were committed on or after the effective date of this section and within a thirty-six month period, the interest of such owner in any vehicle used in the commission of any such second or subsequent violation shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination. Notice of the institution of the forfeiture proceeding shall be in accordance with the provisions of the civil practice law and rules. The penalties provided for in this paragraph shall also apply to any owner who has been convicted of or found liable for one violation of paragraphs one or two of subdivision b or of subdivision c or subdivision k of this section at the time the local law that added this paragraph was enacted and who commits another violation within thirty-six months of the first violation.

   (3) Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of a vehicle after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, no sooner than thirty days after such determination and upon a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited vehicle at public sale. Any person, other than an owner whose interest is forfeited pursuant to this section, who establishes a right of ownership in a vehicle, including a part ownership or security interest, shall be entitle* to delivery of the vehicle if such person;

      (A) redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by payment to the city of the value thereof;

      (B) pays the reasonable expenses of the safekeeping of the vehicle between the time of seizure and such redemption; and

      (C) either (i) asserts a claim in the forfeiture proceeding, or (ii) submits a claim in writing to the commission within thirty days after judicial determination of forfeiture.

   (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision, establishment of a right of ownership shall not entitle a person to delivery of a vehicle if the city establishes in the forfeiture proceeding or in a separate administrative adjudication of a claim asserted pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of this subdivision that the violations of subdivision b, c or k of this section upon which the forfeiture is predicated were expressly or impliedly permitted by such person. The commission or successor agency shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the procedure for such an administrative adjudication, which shall include provision for a hearing.

   (5) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "owner" shall mean an owner as defined in section one hundred twenty-eight and in subdivision three of section three hundred eighty-eight of the vehicle and traffic law.

   (6) The provisions of this subdivision shall not apply to the seizure and forfeiture of commuter vans which shall be governed by sections 19-529.2 and 19-529.3 of this chapter.

i. (1) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, any person who violates any provision of this chapter or any rule promulgated hereunder applicable to commuter van services, commuter vans or drivers of commuter vans shall be subject to a civil penalty in an amount to be prescribed by the commission by rule for specific violations which amount shall be one thousand dollars for a first violation and twenty-five hundred dollars for a second and subsequent violation committed within two years of a first violation. Where such violation involves the operation of a commuter van service without the authorization required by this chapter, the operation of a commuter van without the license required by this chapter or the operation of a commuter van that is not pursuant to a current, valid authorization to operate a commuter van service, such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars and not more than three thousand dollars, and for a subsequent violation committed within two years of the first violation, such person shall be liable for a civil penalty of not less than two thousand dollars and not more than four thousand dollars.

   (2) A proceeding to impose such civil penalty shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation returnable before the commission or an administrative tribunal of the commission. Such civil penalties shall be imposed after a hearing in accordance with the rules of the commission.

   (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, civil penalties imposed by the commission or such tribunal may be recovered by the corporation counsel in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

   (4) Decisions and orders of the commission or such tribunal imposing civil penalties for violations relating to, the operation of commuter van service without authorization and the operation of unlicensed commuter vans and unlicensed drivers of commuter vans may be entered and enforced as if they were money judgments of a court pursuant to subdivision c of section two thousand three hundred three of the charter.

   (5) Notices of violation which are returnable to the commission or such tribunal may be served by any officers or employees designated by the commission, any police officer or any authorized officers or employees of the department of transportation or the New York city transit authority.

j. Where the commission or administrative tribunal thereof finds an owner liable for operating a vehicle as a commuter van without an authorization to operate a commuter van service or without a commuter van license, the commission shall notify the New York state commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to subparagraph four of paragraph a of subdivision five of section eighty of the New York state transportation law of such finding. Upon such notification, the commissioner of motor vehicles, pursuant to such subparagraph four, shall thereupon suspend the registration of such vehicle and shall deny any application for the registration of such vehicle or any application for the renewal thereof pursuant to subdivision five-a of section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law until such time as the commission may give notice that the violation has been corrected to its satisfaction. Operation of any motor vehicle for which the registration has been suspended as herein provided shall constitute a class A misdemeanor. The commission shall also notify the department of finance where it finds an owner liable for operating a vehicle as a commuter van without an authorization to operate a commuter van service or without a commuter van license.

k. No driver of any vehicle with a valid HAIL license shall accept a passenger by street hail within the city of New York from a location where street hails by such vehicles are not permitted.

   (i) A violation of this subdivision shall be punishable by a fine of five hundred dollars for the first violation. A violation of this subdivision shall be punishable by a fine of seven hundred fifty dollars when a driver has been convicted of a violation of this subdivision within the immediately preceding twenty-four months. A violation of this subdivision shall result in revocation of the driver's license issued pursuant to paragraphs (i) and (iii) of subdivision a of section 19-505 of this chapter when such violation is committed by a driver who has previously been convicted of two violations of this section within the immediately preceding one hundred twenty months.

   (ii) A finding that a driver has committed a violation of this subdivision shall be evidence that the owner or operator holding the HAIL license with respect to the vehicle in which such violation was committed failed to make a reasonable good faith effort to deter the commission of such violation. A driver's third conviction of this subdivision within one hundred twenty months shall result in revocation of a HAIL license if each such violation occurred in a vehicle subject to a HAIL license held by such owner or operator of one or more of such HAIL licenses. The New York city taxi and limousine commission or successor agency shall advise such owner or operator holding the HAIL license of his or her potential liability pursuant to this section upon a finding that a violation of paragraph (i) of this subdivision was committed in a vehicle with a valid HAIL license.

l. A person is guilty of unlawful fleeing a New York city taxi and limousine enforcement officer or police officer when, knowing that he or she has been directed to remain stopped by a New York city taxi and limousine enforcement officer or police officer, the driver of a vehicle operating pursuant to a HAIL license who is stopped in a zone where he or she is not permitted to pick up street hails thereafter attempts to flee such officer by setting the vehicle in motion and either travels over three hundred feet without stopping or engages in conduct constituting reckless driving as defined in section twelve hundred twelve of the vehicle and traffic law. Unlawful fleeing a New York city taxi and limousine enforcement officer or police officer is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment of not more than ninety days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, any charge alleging a violation of this subdivision shall be returnable before a court having jurisdiction over misdemeanors.

m. On or before February 1, 2013 and on a quarterly basis thereafter, the commission shall post on its website and provide to the council a report for the prior quarter that includes, at a minimum, the following information, subject to the manner that such data is available: (i) the number of criminal actions commenced pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of this section; (ii) the number of criminal actions commenced pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision b of this section; (iii) the number of civil actions commenced pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision e of this section; (iv) the number of civil actions commenced pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision e of this section; and (v) the number of vehicles seized pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision h of this section, disaggregated by whether such vehicle was seized for a violation of paragraph one or two of subdivision b of this section. Such report shall also be disaggregated by borough and precinct.

n. A person who holds a commuter van license must not allow such commuter van to be operated by a driver who does not hold a commuter van driver’s license issued pursuant to section 19-505. A violation of this subdivision shall result in a civil penalty of $500 and suspension of the commuter van license until the person who holds such license submits an affirmation to the commission affirming that the vehicle which gave rise to such violation will only be operated by a driver who holds a commuter van driver’s license issued pursuant to section 19-505.








*§ 19-506.1 Administrative Tribunal.* ::


a. If the commission is unable to produce a complaining witness in person, where such witness' credibility is relevant to the charges made in the notice of violation, the commission shall make reasonable efforts to make such witness available during the hearing by videoconferencing or teleconferencing. If the complaining witness is not available during a hearing, the commission shall produce a statement outlining its efforts to produce such witness. An administrative law judge shall examine such statement and if he or she decides the commission's efforts to produce the complaining witness were inadequate, the administrative law judge shall dismiss the notice of violation.

b. Hearings where the commission seeks the revocation of a commission issued license for a rule violation that does not provide for the mandatory revocation of such license as a penalty shall be conducted before the office of administrative trials and hearings and shall be subject to the procedures of that tribunal. The commission may authorize other hearings to be conducted before the office of administrative trials and hearings.

c. If a respondent timely files to appeal a decision of the administrative tribunal, any fines imposed by the administrative tribunal shall be stayed until a decision is made in such appeal, provided that the commission shall not be required to refund any fines paid before respondent made his or her appeal unless such appeal is successful. The administrative tribunal shall expedite any appeal involving a suspension or revocation of a commission issued license.

d. If, for the purposes of appealing a decision, a respondent requests a copy of the hearing recording, such recording shall be produced to such respondent within thirty days after receipt of a written request from such respondent. If the commission cannot produce the recording within the thirty day period, the determination being appealed shall be dismissed without prejudice.

e. Notwithstanding any other laws, rules or regulations, where a respondent fails to appear at a scheduled hearing, such respondent shall have two years from the entry of any determination to move to vacate such determination and seek a new hearing. After mailing a notice of default to a respondent, the commission shall prepare a record containing the name of the person who mailed such notice, and the date, time and method used to mail such notice. The commission shall make such record available upon request to such respondent.

   3. No driver of a vehicle the fares of which are set by the commission or successor agency shall charge or attempt to charge a fare above the fare set by the commission or successor agency.

   4. No driver of a for-hire vehicle, other than a driver operating a for-hire vehicle with a valid HAIL license, shall accept passengers unless the passengers have engaged the use of the for-hire vehicle on the basis of telephone contract or prearrangement.

b. 1. (a) Any driver who has been found to have violated a provision of paragraph 1, 2, or 3 of subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, shall be fined not less than $200 nor more than $500 for the first offense. Any driver who has been found in violation of any of the provisions of such paragraphs, or any combination thereof, for a second time within a 24 month period shall be fined not less than $350 nor more than $1,000, and the commission may suspend the driver's license of such driver for a period not to exceed 30 days. Any driver who has been found to have violated any of the provisions of such paragraphs, or any combination thereof, three or more times within a 36 month period shall be fined not more than $1,000 for each such third or subsequent offense, and the commission shall revoke the driver's license of such driver.

      (b) Any driver who has been found to have violated any of the provisions of paragraph 4 of subdivision a of this section shall be fined not less than $200 nor more than $350 for the first offense. Any driver who has been found in violation of any of the provisions of such paragraph for a second time within a 24 month period shall be fined not less than $350 nor more than $500, and the commission may suspend the driver's license of such driver for a period not to exceed 30 days.

c. The commission shall not issue any license under this chapter to any person who has had his or her driver's license revoked pursuant to subdivision b of this section prior to a period of one year from the date of such revocation.

d. 1. Each owner shall make a reasonable good faith effort, by a driver education program or other affirmative measures, to deter the commission of violations of paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision a of this section by drivers of taxicabs for which such owner holds a vehicle license. A finding that a driver has committed a violation of any such paragraph shall create a rebuttable presumption that the owner holding the vehicle license for the taxicab in which such violation was committed has failed to make a reasonable good faith effort to deter the commission of such violation. In any proceeding for a violation of this paragraph, it is an affirmative defense that the owner made a reasonable good faith effort, by a driver education program or other affirmative measures, to deter the commission of violations of paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision a of this section. The commission shall advise an owner in writing of his or her potential liability pursuant to this subdivision upon a finding that a violation of such paragraph was committed in a taxicab for which such owner holds a vehicle license.

   2. If the owner holding a vehicle license for a taxicab or taxicabs in which a driver or drivers have been found to have committed violations of paragraphs one, two or three of subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, is found not to have made a reasonable good faith effort to deter such violation, the owner shall be liable for a violation of paragraph one of this subdivision as follows:

      (iii) for the fourth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one, two or three of subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall fine the owner not less than three hundred fifty nor more than five hundred dollars;

      (iv) for the fifth and each subsequent violation of paragraphs one, two or three of subdivision a of this section, or any combination thereof, committed in a taxicab or taxicabs for which the owner holds a vehicle license or licenses, the commission shall suspend the vehicle license of the taxicab used in the commission of the most recent violation for a period not to exceed sixty days. For purposes of this paragraph, the obligation to have made a "reasonable good faith effort" shall be met if the owner, upon the hiring of each new driver and for all drivers, shall, at least once annually, distribute a copy of applicable commission rules to each driver and obtains a written receipt therefore. The commission shall supply owners with a copy of all such applicable rules. In addition, such rules shall be conspicuously posted by the owner at the owner's place of business so that they are readily visible to all drivers.

   3. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the procedure for an administrative adjudication of violations of paragraph one of this subdivision, which shall include provision for notice and a hearing.

f. The commission may suspend or revoke the license of any person whom it determines has obtained a license by fraud or false representation, or willful misstatement or omission of a material fact.








*§ 19-507.1 Persistent Violators of Rules Relating to Drivers of Taxicabs and For-Hire Vehicles.* ::


a. (1)    Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver may attend a remedial or refresher course approved by the commission. Upon presentation to the commission of proof of satisfactory completion of a commission-approved course by such driver, three points shall be deducted from the number of points assessed under the persistent violators program against his or her commission-issued driver's license, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be eligible for a point reduction pursuant to this subdivision only once within a five-year period. In the event no such approved course is available at the time such driver seeks to enroll, such driver may take a course provided for in paragraph one of subdivision c of section 19-507.2 of this chapter. In such instance, completion of a course taken pursuant to this paragraph or pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision c of section 19-507.2 shall result in the removal of three points from either the number of points accrued under the persistent violators program or from the number of points accrued under the critical drivers program, but not from both, upon the election of the driver who completes such course.

   (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, no point reduction shall affect any suspension or revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to this program prior to the completion of the course and no taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall receive a point reduction unless attendance at the course is voluntary on the part of the driver.

b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission's rules such that six or more points but fewer than ten points have been assessed against his or her commission-issued driver's license within any fifteen-month period and whose license has not been revoked shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license suspended for up to thirty days.

c. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations of the commission's rules such that ten or more points have been assessed against his or her commission-issued driver's license within any fifteen-month period shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license revoked.

d. For the purposes of assessing points against the license of a taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver, where a taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver has been found guilty of multiple violations arising from a single enforcement action by an authorized enforcement agent, such driver shall be deemed guilty of the single violation having the highest point assessment.

e. A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall not be subject to an assessment of points against his or her commission-issued driver's license or the imposition of duplicate penalties where the same act is a violation under provisions of law other than commission rules and where such violations duplicate each other or are substantively the same and any such driver may be issued only one summons or notice of violation for such violation. Points assessed pursuant to section 19-507.2 of this chapter may, pursuant to subdivisions i and j of this section, be added to points assessed by the commission under this section for violations of commission rules.

f. It shall be an affirmative defense that the act which formed the basis for the violation was beyond the control and influence of the taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver.

g. Any violation issued to a taxicab driver or owner for meter-tampering shall be served on the licensee by personal delivery or by certified and regular mail within five calendar days of its issuance. The licensee shall have an opportunity to request a hearing before the commission or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction within ten calendar days after receipt of any such notification. Upon request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days. If the tenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the hearing may be held on the next business day. A decision shall be made with respect to any such proceeding within sixty calendar days after the close of the hearing. In the event such decision is not made within that time period, the license or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be returned by the commission to the licensee and deemed to be in full force and effect until such determination is made. It shall be an affirmative defense to any violation for meter-tampering issued to a taxicab driver or owner that such person (i) did not know of or participate in the alleged meter-tampering and (ii) exercised due diligence to ensure that meter-tampering does not occur.

h. For purposes of subdivision g of this section, examples of an owner's due diligence shall include, but are not limited to (1) giving to their drivers a clear warning that violations of the meter tampering rules will result in the immediate termination of any lease agreement, the reporting to the commission of driver tampering and the commission's probable revocation of the driver's commission-issued driver's license, (2) including in any written lease agreement provisions containing the warnings against violation of meter tampering rules, (3) stamping warnings about the illegality of meter tampering on the trip cards issued to all drivers of an owner's taxicabs, (4) having management personnel or mechanics periodically check for proper odometer and meter mileage comparisons in order to determine if there are inappropriate disparities between the two sets of figures, (5) conducting periodic random inspections of the taxicab meter and its wiring for all of its taxicabs to detect any evidence of violation of the meter tampering rules and (6) having all of such owner's taxicabs inspected by a licensed meter shop once every commission inspection cycle.

i. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations such that six or more points but fewer than ten points in total have been assessed within any fifteen-month period against his or her commission-issued driver's license pursuant to this section and against the driver license issued to such taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver by the department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence pursuant to section 19-507.2 of this chapter and whose commission-issued driver's license has not been revoked shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license suspended for up to thirty days; provided, however, that only points assessed against a commission-issued driver's license for violations that threaten the safety of passengers or any other persons, as specified by rule of the commission, may be applied for purposes of this subdivision.

j. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations such that ten or more points in total have been assessed within any fifteen-month period against his or her commission-issued driver's license pursuant to this section and against the driver's license issued to such taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver by the department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence pursuant to section 19-507.2 of this chapter shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license revoked; provided, however, that only points assessed against a commission-issued driver's license for violations that threaten the safety of passengers or any other persons, as specified by rule of the commission, may be applied for purposes of this subdivision.








*§ 19-507.2 Critical driver program.* ::


a. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations such that six or more points have been assessed by the department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence against the driver license issued to such taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver within any fifteen-month period and whose commission-issued driver's license has not been revoked shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license suspended for thirty days.

b. Any taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver who has been found guilty of violations such that ten or more points have been assessed by the department of motor vehicles or an equivalent licensing agency of the driver's state of residence against the driver license issued to such taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver within any fifteen-month period shall have his or her commission-issued driver's license revoked.

c. (1)    A taxicab or for-hire vehicle driver shall be eligible to receive a three point reduction in the number of points assessed pursuant to the critical driver program upon the submission to the commission of proof of the satisfactory completion of a motor vehicle accident prevention course approved by the department of motor vehicles. Such point reduction shall be considered in computing the total number of points accumulated by such driver as a result of violations which occurred within fifteen months prior to the date of the completion of the course. In the event that no commission approved course is available pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision a of section 19-507.1 of this chapter, completion of a course taken pursuant to this paragraph shall result in the removal of three points from either the number of points accrued under the persistent violators program or from the number of points accrued under the critical drivers program, but not from both, upon the election of the driver who completes such course.

   (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision no point reduction shall affect any suspension or revocation action which may be taken by the commission pursuant to this program prior to the completion of the course. No person shall receive a point reduction more than once in any eighteen month period and no person shall receive a point reduction unless attendance at the course is voluntary on the part of the driver.








*§ 19-507.3 Reporting requirements.* ::


a. An owner shall maintain on file with the commission a current telephone number serviced by an answering machine or recording device, a pager number, telephone answering service number or other information by which telephone contact with the owner or a designated representative may reasonably be expected to be made at all times. An owner or designated representative must respond to any telephone or pager contact from the commission within forty-eight hours.






*§ 19-508 Meters, radios and other equipment.* ::


a. All taxicabs shall be equipped with meters, and the equipment which shall store or transmit for storage fare data, including, but not limited to, the rate of fare and the times or locations such rate of fares were in effect, pick up and drop-off information and any other data as required by the commission. All data required to be stored or transmitted by such equipment shall be made available to the commission in a form and manner as required by the commission. A licensed driver's fare information, including rate of fare and pickup and drop-off information shall be made available to such driver as required by the commission, at no charge to such drivers. The commission shall prescribe by rule, contract or otherwise, responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this section, and for penalties for non-compliance with such provisions. The commission may permit or require other licensed vehicles to be equipped with the same or different types of meters.

b. The commission may permit or require the installation of radio or other equipment of specified types in licensed vehicles, except that the commission shall require that all wheelchair accessible vans contain two-way radios where the owner employs a dispatcher, a number of portable or fixed seat belts equal to the maximum capacity of the van, safety ties sufficient to secure any wheelchair or wheelchairs which the van may at any given time be transporting and such other special equipment as the commission shall determine is necessary to insure the safe transportation of physically handicapped persons. The commission shall require the use of a specified frequency for any radio used by licensed vehicles, said frequency to be assigned by the federal communications com- mission.

c. 1. For purposes of this section, the term "trouble light" shall mean a help or distress signaling light system consisting of a device or devices as designated by the rules of the commission.

   2. Every for-hire vehicle or taxicab placed into operation shall carry a minimum of two spare trouble light devices of a type approved by the commission. In the event that any authorized enforcement agent indicates to a for-hire vehicle or taxicab driver that the vehicle's trouble light is defective, such driver shall have the opportunity to return such defective trouble light to proper working order by replacing it, or by any other corrective action in the presence of such enforcement agent. If the replacement of a trouble light device, or any other corrective action, restores the trouble light to proper working order, no summons or notice of violation may be issued for operating a for-hire vehicle or taxicab with a defective trouble light. In the event that repair of the defective condition is not made in the presence of such enforcement agent and a summons or notice of violation is issued for a defective for-hire vehicle or taxicab trouble light, such summons or notice of violation shall be dismissed by the adjudicatory body before which such summons or notice of violation is heard if: (a) proof that repair of such defect was made within twenty-four hours of the issuance of the summons or notice of violation is provided to the adjudicatory body and (b) the vehicle was not used for hire during the period of time from when the summons or notice of violation was issued to the time the repair was made.

   3. Any person found to have violated the provisions of this subdivision shall be liable for a fine of one hundred seventy-five dollars for each such violation and in addition thereto the license for such vehicle shall be suspended until the defective condition is corrected.






*§ 19-509 Licensing of taximeter business.* ::


a. It shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the business of manufacturing, selling, repairing and adjusting or calibrating taximeters or taximeter equipment for use upon any licensed vehicle in the city unless he or she shall secure a license therefor from the commission, and such person engaged in the business of installing, repairing, adjusting or calibrating taximeters shall only be licensed if he shall have a place of business within the city large enough simultaneously to accommodate at least three vehicles. Such licenses shall be issued for a period not exceeding one year and shall expire on the thirty-first day of March following the date of issue. The fee for the issuance of each such license shall be five hundred dollars per annum for each place of business licensed provided, however, that upon the issuance of a license for a period of six months or less, the fee shall be one-half the annual fee fixed by the commission.

b. It shall be unlawful for such person to sell or attach to a licensed vehicle for use within the city a taximeter which does not comply with the rules and regulations established by the commission, and the commission may establish such rules and regulations in respect to the taximeter business as may be reasonable to assure adequate protection of the public and enforcement of the provisions and purposes of this chapter and may require such reports and other information as it deems necessary or advisable. Any person who shall install, repair, adjust or calibrate any taximeter shall securely affix to the inside of the glass window thereon, so as to be clearly legible from the outside, a printed poster bearing his or her license number.

c. Fees to be charged by persons licensed pursuant to this section shall be subject to approval of the commission. In determining whether any proposed fee or fee schedules shall be approved, the commission shall take into consideration the nature of the service performed, the costs of the licensee, a reasonable profit to the licensee, fees for similar services charged in other communities, and the welfare of the taxicab and taximeter industries.






*§ 19-510 Licensing of official inspection stations. [Repealed]* ::


a. The commission shall require licenses for the operation of two-way radio or other communications systems used for dispatching or conveying information to drivers of licensed vehicles, including for-hire vehicles or wheelchair accessible vans and shall require licenses for base stations, upon such terms as it deems advisable and upon payment of reasonable license fees of not more than five hundred dollars a year. There shall be an additional fee of twenty-five dollars for late filing of a license renewal application where such filing is permitted by the commission.

b. The operator of a base station shall provide and utilize lawful off-street facilities for the parking and storage of the licensed for-hire vehicles that are to be dispatched from that base station equal to not less than one parking space for every two such vehicles or fraction thereof. The commission shall establish by rule criteria for off-street parking which shall include, but not be limited to, the maximum permissible distance between the base station and such off-street parking facilities and the proximity of such off-street parking facilities and the proximity of such off-street parking facilities to residences and community facilities as defined in the zoning resolution of the city of New York. A license for a new base station shall only be granted where the applicant has demonstrated to the commission prior to the issuance of such license that off-street parking facilities sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this subdivision shall be provided.

c. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision b of this section, a license for a base station which was valid on the effective date of this section shall only be renewed upon the condition that within two years of such renewal the licensee shall provide off-street parking facilities as required by subdivision b of this section.

d. (1)    No license for a new base station shall be issued unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commission that the applicant will comply with the off-street parking requirements of subdivision b of this section and the commission finds that the operation of a base station by the applicant at the proposed location would meet such other criteria as may be established by the commission. Among the other factors which must be examined and considered by the commission in making a determination to issue a license are the adequacy of existing mass transit and mass transportation facilities to meet the transportation needs of the public any adverse impact that the proposed operation may have on those existing services and the fitness of the applicant. In determining the fitness of the applicant the commission shall consider, but is not limited to considering, such factors as the ability of the applicant to adequately manage the base station, the applicant's financial stability and whether the applicant operates or previously operated a licensed base station and the manner in which any such base station was operated. The commission shall also consider the extent and quality of service provided by existing lawfully operating for-hire vehicles and taxicabs.

   (2) No license for a new base station shall be issued for a period of three years subsequent to a determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding that the applicant or any officer, shareholder, director or partner of the applicant operated a base station that had not been licensed by the commission.

   (3) In its review of an application for a license to operate a new base station and in its review of an application to renew a base station license the commission shall also consider the possible adverse effect of such base station on the quality of life in the vicinity of the base station including, but not limited to, traffic congestion, sidewalk congestion and noise. In its review of an application to renew a base station license the commission shall also consider whether a determination has been made after an administrative proceeding that the operator has violated any applicable rule of the commission.

   (4) No base station license shall be renewed where it has been determined after an administrative proceeding that the applicant has failed to comply with the off-street parking requirements set forth in subdivision b of this section or as they may have been modified pursuant to subdivision h of this section.

e. A licensed base station shall at all times have no fewer than ten affiliated vehicles, except that a base station for which a license was first issued prior to January 1, 1988 and which at that time had fewer than ten affiliated vehicles or a base station which has an affiliation with a wheelchair accessible vehicle may have as few as five affiliated vehicles, not including black cars and luxury limousines.

f. Prior to the issuance of a license for a base station or the renewal of a valid base station license, the applicant shall provide to the commission a bond in the amount of five thousand dollars with one or more sureties to be approved by the commission. Such bond shall be for the benefit of the city and shall be conditioned upon the licensee complying with the requirement that the licensee dispatch only vehicles which are currently licensed by the commission and which have a current New York city commercial use motor vehicle tax stamp and upon the payment by the licensee of all civil penalties imposed pursuant to any provision of this chapter.

g. Upon receiving an application for the issuance of a license for a new base station or for the renewal of a license for a base station pursuant to this section, the commission shall, within five business days, submit a copy of such application to the council and to the district office of the council member and the community board for the area in which the base station is or would be located.

h. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions b and c of this section, the commission may reduce the number of required off-street parking spaces or may waive such requirement in its entirety where the commission determines that sufficient lawful off-street parking facilities do not exist within the maximum permissible distance from the base station or an applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commission that complying with the off-street parking requirements set forth in such subdivisions would impose an economic hardship upon the applicant; except that the commission shall not reduce or waive the off-street parking requirements where it has been determined in an administrative proceeding that the applicant, or a predecessor in interest, has violated any provision of section 6-03 of the rules of the commission or any successor thereto, as such may from time to time be amended. A determination to waive or reduce the off-street parking requirements shall be made in writing, shall contain a detailed statement of the reasons why such determination was made and shall be made a part of the commission's determination to approve an application for a base station license.

i. The determination by the commission to approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or for the renewal of a license to operate a base station shall be made in writing and shall be accompanied by copies of the data, information and other materials relied upon by the commission in making that determination. Such determination shall be sent to the council and to the district office of the council member within whose district that base station is or would be located within five business days of such determination being made.






*§ 19-511.1 Council review.* ::


Any determination by the commission to approve an application for a license to operate a new base station or to renew a license to operate a base station shall be subject to review by the council. Within ninety days of the first stated meeting following receipt of such determination and its accompanying materials, the council may approve or disapprove such determination by local law, after having adopted a resolution to review that determination. In the event that the council fails to act by local law within the ninety day period provided for in this section, the determination of the commission shall remain in effect. Where a base station license would otherwise expire while a determination by the commission to approve a renewal of such license is pending before the council, such license shall remain in full force and effect, unless suspended or revoked by the commission, until either the council has passed a local law to disapprove such determination or the period within which the council may act has elapsed.






*§ 19-512 Transferability of taxicab licenses issued pursuant to this chapter.* ::


a. Any taxicab license issued pursuant to this chapter and any renewals thereof, shall be transferable to a transferee who has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commission that he is qualified to assume the duties and obligations of a taxicab owner.

b. An owner's interest in such taxicab license may be transferred involuntarily and disposed of by public or private sale in the same manner as personal property provided, however, that upon such involuntary transfer the owner's license shall immediately be cancelled and a new license issued to the purchaser or his or her vendee, provided that such purchaser or vendee satisfied the requirements of subdivision (a) hereof.

c. The commission may charge a fee of one hundred sixty dollars for its administrative expenses in connection with the transfer (i) of an owner's interest in a taxicab license transferable pursuant to the provisions of this section or (ii) of the stock in a corporation which is an owner of a taxicab license that is transferable pursuant to the provisions of this section.








*§ 19-512.1 Revocation of taxicab, for-hire or HAIL license or licenses.* ::


a. The commission or successor agency may, for good cause shown relating to a direct and substantial threat to the public health or safety and prior to giving notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend a taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license issued pursuant to this chapter and, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend or revoke such license. The commission or successor agency may also, without having suspended a taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license, issue a determination to seek suspension or revocation of such license and after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, suspend or revoke such license. Notice of such suspension or of a determination by the commission or successor agency to seek suspension or revocation of a taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license shall be served on the licensee by personal delivery or by certified and regular mail within five calendar days of the pre-hearing suspension or of such determination. The licensee shall have an opportunity to request a hearing before an administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction within ten calendar days after receipt of any such notification. Upon request such hearing shall be scheduled within ten calendar days, unless the commission or successor agency or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that such hearing would be prejudicial to an ongoing criminal or civil investigation. If the tenth day falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday, the hearing may be held on the next business day. A decision shall be made with respect to any such proceeding within sixty calendar days after the close of the hearing. In the event such decision is not made within that time period, the license or medallion which is the subject of the proceeding shall be returned by the commission or successor agency to the licensee and deemed to be in full force and effect until such determination is made, unless the commission or successor agency or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that the issuance of such determination would be prejudicial to an ongoing criminal or civil investigation.

b. It shall be an affirmative defense that the holder of the taxicab, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license or the owner of the taxicab, for-hire vehicle or HAIL vehicle has (1) exercised due diligence in the inspection, management and/or operation of the taxicab, for-hire vehicle or HAIL vehicle and (2) did not know or have reason to know of the acts of any other person with respect to that taxicab license, for-hire vehicle license or a HAIL license or taxicab, for-hire vehicle or HAIL vehicle upon which a suspension, proposed suspension or proposed revocation is based. With respect to any violation arising from taximeter tampering, an owner's due diligence shall include, but not be limited to, those actions set forth in subdivision h of section 19-507.1 of this chapter. Any pre-hearing suspension period shall be counted towards any suspension period made in any final determination.






*§ 19-513 Repossessions.* ::


Any taxicab which is transferred involuntarily because of a default in the payment or installments due under the contract of sale, or any other contract or in any other manner whereby the license holder's interest in the license is not also transferred, and which is disposed according to law at public or private sale, may be operated by the purchaser thereof or his or her vendee, provided such purchaser or vendee is acceptable to the commission as a person suitable to receive a license. Upon such involuntary transfer, the license of said taxicab shall be cancelled immediately and a temporary, nontransferable, nonrenewable license issued to such purchaser or vendee for a period not exceeding one year upon the payment of a fee of not exceeding one hundred dollars therefor. At the end of such time, the original holder of the license, or his or her transferee if the license was first issued before the effective date of this chapter, shall be entitled to renewal of the license, provided that the provisions of subdivision (a) of section 19-512 of this chapter are complied with by such applicant, whether he or she is the original holder or a transferee.

d. Such applications must include colored sketches of the proposed color schemes of the emblems or designs, together with such other and further information as the commission may require.

e. An owner shall not use an emblem granted to another owner or association, an emblem so similar as to lead to confusion in the mind of the public, or an emblem granted to any association unless he or she be a member of said association. The commission may suspend the license of any owner violating the provisions hereof.

f. Each taxicab license shall be represented by a metal medallion which shall bear the license number and be affixed to the outside of the licensed taxicab. The commission may require that a notice be posted at the main entrance of each garage housing taxicab vehicles reciting the number of such vehicles, their license numbers and such other information as the commission may designate.

g. Any vehicle for hire except those licensed under the provisions of this chapter shall not bear the colors yellow, orange, or gold, or, in combination of yellow-white, orange-white, gold-white, green-white, blue-white or any other combination of the above said colors or color scheme or striping in said colors.

h. Any accessible taxicab or for-hire vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the international wheelchair insignia or other insignia approved by the commission that identifies such vehicle as an accessible vehicle, in a minimum of two prominent locations on such vehicle's exterior. For purposes of this subdivision, "accessible vehicle" shall mean any vehicle approved for use by the commission as a taxicab or for-hire vehicle that meets the specifications and requirements for accessible vehicles pursuant to the americans with disabilities act of 1990, as amended, and rules promulgated by the commission.

i. Any clean air vehicle licensed by the commission shall display the words "CLEAN AIR VEHICLE" or such other term or symbol approved by the commission that identifies such vehicle as a clean air vehicle in a minimum of two prominent locations on such vehicle's exterior. For the purposes of this subdivision, "clean air vehicle" shall mean any taxicab or for-hire vehicle approved for use by the commission that receives an air pollution score of 9.0 or higher from the United States environmental protection agency or its successor agency and is estimated to emit 6.4 tons or less of equivalent carbon dioxide per year by the United States department of energy or its successor agency; provided that such vehicle is powered by the fuel for which such vehicle meets the above-specified standards. In the event the test method used by the United States environmental protection agency or its successor agency for determining fuel economy is adjusted in a way that impacts United States department of energy or its successor agency estimates of equivalent carbon dioxide emissions for motor vehicles, the commission shall, for vehicles that fall within the affected model years, modify by rule the equivalent carbon dioxide emissions estimate included herein so as to appropriately reflect such adjustment's impact consistent with the intent of this section.






*§ 19-515 Color schemes and emblems.* ::


a. For-hire vehicles may be painted any color approved by the commission, other than the colors reserved for medallion taxis.

b. For-hire vehicles shall have the name of the owner or operator displayed on the outside or inside of the vehicle in such form as shall be prescribed by the commission, except that the commission may prescribe an exemption from this requirement for classes of for-hire vehicles for which such display would be inappropriate. All for-hire vehicles must at all times carry in the glove compartment and produce upon demand of any police, peace, law enforcement officer, inspector or officer of the commission:

   1. The for-hire vehicle license.

   2. The driver's commission-issued driver's license.

*§ 19-517 For-hire vehicle licenses.* ::


The commission may require that a notice be posted at the main entrance of each garage housing for-hire vehicles reciting the number of such vehicles, their license numbers and such other information as the commission may designate.






*§ 19-518 Transfer of licenses.* ::


a. No for-hire vehicle license shall be transferred or assigned, nor shall such vehicle license be used in affiliation with any garage or business location other than the location stated in such license.

b. Any base station license or ownership interest in the licensee may be transferred to a proposed transferee who has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the commission the qualifications to assume the duties and obligations of a base station owner provided that either the transferor or transferee shall have filed a bond to cover all the outstanding tort liabilities of the transferor arising out of the operation of a base station and the for-hire vehicles owned by the transferor which is in excess of the amount covered by any bond or insurance policy in effect pursuant to the vehicle and traffic law, and all outstanding fines, penalties and other liabilities which the transferor owes to the commission shall have been satisfied. All such transfers and any changes in corporate offices or directors must be approved by the commission in order to be effective. The commission shall establish by rule the factors to be considered for approval of a proposed transferee, officer or director which shall include, but not be limited to, the criminal history of the proposed transferee and of the transferee's officers, shareholders, directors and partners, if any, or the proposed officers or directors, in a manner consistent with article twenty-three-A of the correction law, any relevant information maintained in the records of the department of more vehicles or the commission, and transferee's financial stability.

c. A transfer shall not be approved if in the past two years, the proposed transferee or any officer, shareholder, director or partner of the proposed transferee, where appropriate, has been found to have violated any law or rule involving:

   (i) assaultive behavior toward a passenger, official or member of the public in connection with any matter relating to a for-hire vehicle;

   (ii) conviction for giving or offering an unlawful gratuity to a public servant, as defined in section 10.00 of the penal law.

   (iii) providing the commission with false information; or

   (iv) three unexplained failures to respond to an official communication of the commission or the department of investigation which was sent via certified mail, return receipt requested.

d. No voluntary transfer of a base station license may be made if a judgment in favor of the city of New York or any agency thereof or any state or federal agency has been docketed with the clerk of any county within the city of New York against the licensee and remains unsatisfied, except that a transfer may be permitted if an appeal is pending from an unsatisfied judgment and a bond is filed in an amount sufficient to satisfy the judgment. A transfer may also be permitted without filing a bond as set forth in this subdivision provided that all the judgment creditors of a licensee file written permission for such a transfer with the commission or that the proceeds from the transfer are paid into court or held in escrow on terms and conditions approved by the commission which will have the effect of protecting the rights of all parties who may have an interest therein.

e. The commission may by rule establish a fee in connection with an application to transfer a base station license or an ownership interest in a base station licensee.

f. The commission shall revoke any base station license for nonuse in the event it shall find after a public hearing that the base station has not been in operation for sixty consecutive days, provided that such failure to operate shall not have been caused by strike, riot, war, public catastrophe or other act beyond the control of the licensee.

   (2) the conduct that was the basis for the seizure was committed by any person other than such person claiming an interest in the vehicle, while such vehicle was unlawfully in the possession of a person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws of the United States or any state.

f. For purposes of subdivision e of this section, if such person claiming an interest in the vehicle had knowledge of the use of the vehicle for the conduct that was the basis for such seizure, such person shall be deemed to have consented to the unlawful conduct unless such person establishes that he or she did all that could reasonably have been done to prevent the use of the vehicle for such unlawful conduct.

g. The city, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall, at its discretion, either:

   (1) retain such vehicle for the official use of the city; or

* Editor's note: Section 3 of L.L. 2018/149 provides that § 19-548 takes effect on December 12, 2018, except that subdivision d. of § 19-548 takes effect on February 10, 2018.






*§ 19-549 Minimum payments to for-hire vehicle drivers and minimum fares.* ::


a. Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term “trip” means a transportation service that involves picking up a passenger at a location, and taking and depositing such passenger at a different location requested by such passenger.

b. The commission shall by rule establish a method for determining the minimum payment that must be made to a for-hire vehicle driver for a trip dispatched by a high-volume for-hire service to such driver. In establishing such method, the commission shall, at a minimum, consider the duration and distance of the trip, the expenses of operation to the driver, any applicable vehicle utilization standard, rates of fare and the adequacy of for-hire vehicle driver income considered in relation to for-hire vehicle driver expenses. Such rule promulgated by the commission shall not prevent payments to for-hire vehicle drivers from being calculated on an hourly or weekly basis, or by any other method, provided that the actual payments made to such drivers are no less than the minimum payments determined in accordance with the method established by the commission.

c. The commission shall study payments to for-hire vehicle drivers dispatched by bases other than through high-volume for-hire services for trips dispatched by such bases and may by rule establish a method for determining the minimum payment that must be made to a for-hire vehicle driver for a trip dispatched by any such base.

d. Following completion of the study required by section 19-550, the commission shall determine whether the establishment of minimum rates of fare to be charged by vehicles licensed by the commission would substantially alleviate any of the problems identified in such study. If the commission determines that such minimum rates of fare would have such an effect, the commission is authorized to establish by rule such minimum rates of fare. In setting such minimum rates of fare, the commission may consider the category of vehicle, the type of trip, including trips in which the vehicle is available for the transportation of two or more passengers, the rates of fare for other categories of vehicles carrying passengers for hire, including but not limited to taxicabs, the location of the trip, including trips originating, terminating or passing through the hail exclusionary zone, as defined in section 51-03 of title 35 of the rules of the city of New York, and any other factors the commission determines to be appropriate to achieve their intended result. Such minimum rates of fare shall not include any taxes, fees or surcharges imposed on trips made by vehicles licensed by the commission. The commission shall, on a periodic basis, but not less than once annually, review such minimum rates of fare in order to determine whether any amendment of such minimum rates of fare is warranted or necessary in order for such minimum rates of fare to continue to achieve their intended result. If the commission determines that such an amendment is warranted or necessary, it is hereby authorized, by rule, to promulgate such amendment.








*§ 19-550 Vehicle utilization standards.* ::

The study shall be conducted during the 12 months following the effective date of the local law that added this section.

b. Based on the results of the study conducted pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the commission:

   1. may establish vehicle utilization standards for the operation of vehicles dispatched by high-volume for-hire services in the city and, if such standards are established, shall review such standards on a periodic basis, but not less than once annually, and based on such review may revise such standards for the operation of such vehicles; and

   2. shall review the number of for-hire vehicle licenses on a periodic basis, but not less than once annually, and based on such review may regulate the number of for-hire vehicle licenses issued pursuant to section 19-504.

c. The commission may vary the vehicle utilization standards established, and the number of licenses issued, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, by geographic area of the city, time of day, day of the week, whether a vehicle is a wheelchair accessible vehicle or a low- or zero-emission vehicle and by such other factors as the commission deems appropriate to address traffic congestion, shared rides, traffic safety, vehicle emissions, for-hire vehicle ridership, the income drivers derive from providing transportation services to passengers and the availability of for-hire vehicle services in different geographic areas of the city.

d. For each trip a high-volume for-hire service offers or otherwise facilitates through one or more black car base, luxury limousine base or livery base station, the commission may require the following data be provided:

   1. For each trip dispatched by such base or base station:

      (a) the driver license number issued by the commission;

e. The commission shall establish penalties to be imposed on a high-volume for-hire service for the failure of such service to meet any vehicle utilization standards established pursuant to this section. Such penalties shall be calculated by multiplying the total number of trips dispatched by such service within a 24-hour period by the following penalty ranges: no less than $0.01 per trip dispatched and no greater than $0.10 per trip dispatched for the first violation of any vehicle utilization standard; no less than $0.50 per trip dispatched and no more than $0.80 per trip dispatched for a second violation within a 24-month period; and no less than $1 per trip dispatched and no greater than $5 per trip dispatched for any subsequent violation within a 24-month period. The establishment of penalties by the commission shall depend on an assessment of factors, which shall include but need not be limited to the extent to which the high-volume for-hire service has failed to meet any vehicle utilization standard established by the commission during the previous 12 months, the scale of the divergence from such standard, and the number of vehicles dispatched by such service in a 24-hour hour period. Such civil penalties shall not affect the authority of the commission to suspend or revoke the license of any high-volume for-hire service or the license of any base or base station.

f. A high-volume for-hire service shall not deduct any payment owed to any driver for a trip dispatched by such service for the payment of any penalties imposed by the commission pursuant to subdivision e of this section. The commission shall establish penalties no less than $500 and no greater than $1,000 for each violation of this subdivision.

g. The commission shall no later than December 31, 2020 and annually thereafter submit to the council and the mayor a report on the effects of vehicle utilization standards and the regulation of the number of licenses issued to for-hire vehicles authorized by subdivision b of this section.

The commission, in consultation with the department of consumer affairs and any other agencies designated by the mayor, shall engage in outreach and education efforts that are intended to inform individuals who are considering whether to enter into purchase, rental, lease or loan agreements for the purpose of obtaining vehicles for use as for-hire vehicles, and individuals who are considering whether to purchase, refinance or lease a taxicab license, about the costs and benefits of entering into such arrangements and transactions. Such outreach and education efforts may include written materials describing the common terms of such arrangements and transactions and identifying resources intended to help an individual understand the terms of such arrangements and transactions. The commission shall make any materials designed for the purposes of conducting such outreach and education available in English and in the six languages most commonly spoken by drivers, as those languages are determined by the commission, and in any other languages the commission determines to be appropriate. The commission shall make such materials available on the commission's website.








*§ 19-552 Risk of loss on trip payments.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any inconsistent regulations, provisions of law or provisions of any contract entered into after the effective date of the local law that added this section, if a payment transaction for a completed trip dispatched by a high-volume for-hire service fails, such high-volume for-hire service shall ensure that the driver receives the entire amount owed to such driver for such completed trip.

b. Notwithstanding subdivision a of this section, a high-volume for-hire service may refuse to deposit funds to a driver for rendering services upon a reasonable belief that the driver’s account is associated with fraudulent activity.

c. Any high-volume for-hire service that violates this section is liable for a civil penalty of not less than $250 nor more than $500 for each offense.








*§ 19-553 Leasing, rental and conditional purchase of for-hire vehicles.* ::

Chapter 7: Accessible Water Borne Commuter Services Facilities Transportation Act
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 19-701 Short title.* ::


This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Accessible Water Borne Commuter Services Facilities Transportation Act".






*§ 19-702 Legislative findings and intent.* ::


The Council hereby finds that the city of New York's water borne commuter services facilities are not uniformly accessible to disabled persons. This is a matter of serious concern affecting the public safety and welfare. The Council believes that there is an immediate need for regulation of water borne commuter services in order to enable disabled members of the public to have access to such services on an equal basis with non-disabled persons. The Council believes that under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), disabled persons have the right to access commuter transportation services on an equal and non-discriminatory basis. However, the Council finds that no federal or state laws, rules or regulations are in effect that establish specific standards regarding access by disabled persons to water borne commuter services facilities in the city or the safety of such persons when utilizing such facilities. As a result, disabled persons in the city of New York are not assured that they can safely and consistently access water borne commuter services facilities. This legislation sets specific standards in relation to mandating accessible water borne commuter services facilities for disabled persons, thereby minimizing the tremendous and unfair burden placed on disabled persons who rely on these services. The Council further finds that the city's transportation needs and system are unique in that, unlike many other cities, major waterways are interspersed throughout the greater New York city area, resulting in residential concentrations that are in many instances separated by water from major centers of employment. Consequently, the city historically has had an extensive passenger ferry system. Furthermore, because of increasing levels of traffic congestion and air pollution, and concerns regarding the threat of terrorism to other modes of transportation, the city is rapidly developing an increasingly expansive system of passenger ferry transportation. The Council finds that it is imperative that such development results in water borne commuter services facilities that are accessible to all persons.






*§ 19-703 Definitions.* ::


For purposes of this chapter, the following terms shall be defined as follows:

a. "Accessible route" has the meaning set forth in section 19-705.

d. "Disabled persons" means persons with physical disabilities, including but not limited to mobility impairments, sight impairments, hearing impairments and speech impairments, and further includes persons utilizing a service animal or wheelchair or other physical mobility aid.

e. "Gangway" means a pedestrian walkway that changes slope to accommodate changes in water level, linking a fixed structure or land with a barge, float, dock or other floating structure except a water borne commuter vessel.

f. "Operator" means any person or private or governmental entity that owns or operates a water borne commuter services facility.

g. "Passenger" means every person other than the captain and crew on board a water borne commuter vessel.

h. "Point of embarkation or disembarkation" means any portal point of entry or exit onto or off of a water borne commuter vessel, or into or out of the main cabin area of such water borne commuter vessel.

i. "Transition plate" means any sloping pedestrian walking surface located at the end of a gangway, vessel loading equipment, point of embarkation or disembarkation or coaming.

j. "Vessel loading equipment" means any piece of equipment or assembly of equipment, whether or not such equipment requires operation by water borne commuter services facility personnel, that may be located on a water borne commuter vessel or located on a landing, that bridges from a water borne commuter vessel to a barge, float, dock or other floating structure or landing, the purpose of which is to accommodate the differences in elevation between such water borne commuter vessel and such barge, float, dock or other floating structure or landing.

k. "Water borne commuter services facility" means any dock, pier, slip or terminal located within the city of New York or its territorial waters and utilized by a water borne commuter vessel, as well as water borne commuter vessels and any concession, ticket purchasing or other facility or amenity available at or on such dock, pier, slip, terminal or water borne commuter vessel.
