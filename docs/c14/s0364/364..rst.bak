Section 364. ::    
        
     
        §  364.    Revocable consents.   a.   A revocable consent shall not be
      granted for a use that would  interfere  with  the  use  of  inalienable
      property  of the city for public purposes, nor shall a revocable consent
      be granted for a purpose for which a franchise may be granted.
        b.   All revocable consents shall be revocable  at  any  time  by  the
      responsible agency, shall be granted for a fixed term, and shall provide
      for adequate compensation to be annually provided to the city during the
      continuance of the consent.
        c. Revocable consents, other than for telecommunications purposes, may
      be  granted by the department of transportation with respect to property
      under its jurisdiction or by such other agency as may be  authorized  by
      law   to   grant   revocable   consents.      Revocable   consents   for
      telecommunications  purposes  may  be  granted  by  the  department   of
      information  technology  and  telecommunications. All revocable consents
      shall require the approval of the department of transportation.
        d.  Every petition for the grant of a revocable consent shall be filed
      with the department of transportation.   Each petition shall  state  the
      location of the proposed revocable consent and shall be in such form and
      contain  such  other information as the department of transportation and
      other responsible agencies, if any, shall require by rule. Petitions for
      each type of revocable consent shall be distributed to and  reviewed  by
      the  agencies  required  to do so by local law or executive order of the
      mayor.   If, in the judgment of  the  department  of  city  planning,  a
      proposed  revocable  consent  has  land use impacts or implications, the
      petition for the proposed revocable consent shall be subject  to  review
      and  approval pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-c and section
      one hundred ninety-seven-d.
        e.     Notwithstanding  any  provision  of   this   charter   or   the
      administrative   code,  revocable  consents  to  construct  and  operate
      sidewalk cafes shall be reviewed pursuant to subchapter six  of  chapter
      two of title twenty of the administrative code.
