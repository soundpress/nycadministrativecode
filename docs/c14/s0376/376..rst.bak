        §  376.  Central file.   Copies of all franchise and revocable consent
      agreements shall be filed with the department of  transportation.    The
      department of transportation shall compile and keep up to date a listing
      of  all  current  franchises  and  revocable  consents  which  shall  be
      available to the public and shall include the date, terms, names of  the
      parties, description of the permitted use and location of each franchise
      and revocable consent.  Such listing shall be arranged and indexed so as
      to  enable  a  member of the public to determine what current franchises
      and revocable  consents  involving  use  or  occupancy  of  streets  and
      sidewalks  have  been  granted  for  any  location  in  the city and the
      identity of the holder of each such franchise or revocable consent.
