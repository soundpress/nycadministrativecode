        §  374.  Concessions.    a.  No  city  agency shall grant a concession
      without  either  complying  with  the  procedures  established  by   the
      franchise  and  concession review committee or obtaining the approval of
      the committee prior to granting the concession.
        b. The city planning commission shall adopt  rules  that  either  list
      major  concessions  or  establish  a procedure for determining whether a
      concession is a major concession.   A "major concession"  shall  mean  a
      concession  that  has  significant land use impacts and implications, as
      determined by the  commission,  or  for  which  the  preparation  of  an
      environmental   impact   statement  is  required  by  law.    All  major
      concessions shall be subject to review and approval pursuant to  section
      one hundred ninety-seven-c and section one hundred ninety-seven-d.
