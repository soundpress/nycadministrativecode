Section 363. ::    
        
     
        § 363. Franchises.  a.  Franchises shall be awarded only in accordance
      with  the provisions of an authorizing resolution adopted by the council
      pursuant to the provisions of this section.
        b.   An  initial  determination  of  the  need  for  franchises  of  a
      particular  type  shall  be made by the head of the agency designated by
      the mayor as having the primary  expertise  and  responsibility  in  the
      policy  area  covered  by  that  type of franchise.   Upon making such a
      determination, such agency, with the advice of the  corporation  counsel
      and  such  other  agencies as the mayor shall determine, shall prepare a
      proposed authorizing resolution for that type  of  franchise  and  shall
      submit  such  proposed  authorizing  resolution  to  the mayor.   Such a
      proposed authorizing resolution  shall  set  forth  the  nature  of  the
      franchise  or  franchises  to  be  granted,  the  public  service  to be
      provided, the terms and  conditions  of  the  franchise  or  franchises,
      including  any  subsidies that will be given to a franchisee, the method
      by which proposals will be solicited for the franchise or franchises and
      the criteria to  be  used  in  evaluating  the  proposals  submitted  in
      response to such a solicitation.
        c.  The mayor may submit such a proposed authorizing resolution to the
      council.   Promptly upon submission to the council, the text of any such
      authorizing resolution shall be published in the City  Record.    Within
      ninety  days  of receiving such a proposed resolution, the  council or a
      committee of the council shall hold a public hearing on such resolution.
      The council may approve, approve with modifications or  disapprove  such
      resolution  by  majority  vote.    Any action of the council approving a
      modification to a proposed  authorizing  resolution  or  disapproving  a
      proposed  authorizing  resolution shall be subject to the disapproval of
      the mayor in the same manner as a local  law  which  is  passed  by  the
      council,  and  any such disapproval shall be subject to reconsideration,
      repassing and adoption, notwithstanding the objections of the mayor,  in
      the  same  manner  as a local law which is disapproved by the mayor. The
      council may on its own initiative amend an authorizing resolution.   The
      procedure  for  council review and approval of such a proposed amendment
      shall be the same as for an authorizing resolution.
        d.   No authorizing resolution or other  action  of  the  council  may
      provide  for any involvement by the council or any member of the council
      in the selection of a franchisee pursuant to such resolution.
        e. Pursuant to an authorizing resolution adopted by the  council,  the
      responsible agency may issue one or more requests for proposals or other
      solicitations  of  proposals,  provided that (1) the corporation counsel
      shall have determined that the request for proposals is consistent  with
      the  provisions of the authorizing resolution and (2) no such request or
      solicitation shall be  issued  unless  either  the  department  of  city
      planning  has determined that the proposed franchise would not have land
      use impacts or implications or such request  or  solicitation  has  been
      reviewed and approved pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-c and
      section  one  hundred  ninety-seven-d.    A  community board may waive a
      public hearing and the preparation  of  a  written  recommendation  with
      respect  to  any such request for proposals or solicitation which in its
      judgment does not involve a substantial land use  interest.    Any  such
      request  for  proposals  or  solicitation issued in accordance with this
      subdivision shall set forth the criteria and procedures to  be  utilized
      in  evaluating  the  proposals  submitted in response to such request or
      solicitation.
        f.  The selection of a franchisee shall  be  in  accordance  with  the
      provisions of the authorizing resolution covering franchises of the type
      involved.    Each  such  selection and each franchise agreement shall be
      subject to the review and  approval  of  the  franchise  and  concession
    
      review  committee  pursuant to sections three hundred seventy-one, three
      hundred seventy-two and three hundred seventy-three.
        g.    Nothing  in  this  section  shall  preclude any agency, prior to
      proposing an authorizing resolution, from issuing one or  more  requests
      for  information  or  other  solicitations  of information regarding the
      availability of potential franchisees  with  expertise  in  the  subject
      matter  of  a  proposed  type  of  franchise,  suggestions regarding the
      appropriate terms  and  conditions  which  should  be  contained  in  an
      authorizing   resolution  for  that  type  of  franchise  or  any  other
      information which would assist the agency in determining how to  proceed
      with regard to the public service involved.
        h.      All   franchises   shall  be  consistent  with  the  following
      requirements:
        (1) Every grant of a franchise or  modification  thereof  must  be  by
      written  agreement  approved  by  the  franchise  and  concession review
      committee and executed by the responsible agency under the authority  of
      an  authorizing resolution adopted by the council in accordance with the
      provisions of this chapter.
        (2)  No such agreement shall be for a longer period  than  twenty-five
      years  except  that  in  the  case  of a tunnel railroad it may be for a
      period not exceeding fifty years.
        (3) The agreement may, at the option of the city, provide  for  giving
      to  the  grantee  the  right  of renewals not exceeding in the aggregate
      twenty-five years on a fair redetermination of the compensation  to  the
      city to be made upon standards and methods as therein specified.
        (4)    At the termination of such agreement all the rights or property
      of the grantee in the inalienable property of  the  city  to  which  the
      franchise relates shall cease without compensation.
        (5)    Any  such  agreement  may provide that upon its termination the
      property, plant and equipment  of  the  grantee  shall,  to  the  extent
      therein  specified,  thereupon  be  and become the property of the city,
      either without compensation to the grantee or on payment to the  grantee
      of  the  fair value thereof as property, to be determined as provided in
      the contract, but excluding any value derived from the franchise.    The
      city shall have the option either to take and operate on its own account
      the property, plant and equipment when so acquired, or to lease the same
      for a term not exceeding twenty years or to require that the property of
      the  city  be  restored  to  its  condition prior to the granting of the
      franchise.
        (6) Every agreement granting a franchise for the  performance  of  any
      public  service  shall  contain an agreement by the grantee to recognize
      the  right  of   its   employees   to   bargain   collectively   through
      representatives of their own choosing, and at all times to recognize and
      deal  with  the  representatives  duly  designated  or  selected  by the
      majority of its employees for the purpose of  collective  bargaining  in
      respect  to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions
      of employment and not to dominate, interfere with or participate in  the
      management  or  control  of  or  give  financial support to any union or
      association of its employees.   This subdivision shall not  apply  to  a
      contract  providing  for  a modification or amendment of or extension of
      service under a franchise not containing a similar  provision,  provided
      that the term of such franchise is not extended thereby.

Section 364. ::    
        
     
        §  364.    Revocable consents.   a.   A revocable consent shall not be
      granted for a use that would  interfere  with  the  use  of  inalienable
      property  of the city for public purposes, nor shall a revocable consent
      be granted for a purpose for which a franchise may be granted.
        b.   All revocable consents shall be revocable  at  any  time  by  the
      responsible agency, shall be granted for a fixed term, and shall provide
      for adequate compensation to be annually provided to the city during the
      continuance of the consent.
        c. Revocable consents, other than for telecommunications purposes, may
      be  granted by the department of transportation with respect to property
      under its jurisdiction or by such other agency as may be  authorized  by
      law   to   grant   revocable   consents.      Revocable   consents   for
      telecommunications  purposes  may  be  granted  by  the  department   of
      information  technology  and  telecommunications. All revocable consents
      shall require the approval of the department of transportation.
        d.  Every petition for the grant of a revocable consent shall be filed
      with the department of transportation.   Each petition shall  state  the
      location of the proposed revocable consent and shall be in such form and
      contain  such  other information as the department of transportation and
      other responsible agencies, if any, shall require by rule. Petitions for
      each type of revocable consent shall be distributed to and  reviewed  by
      the  agencies  required  to do so by local law or executive order of the
      mayor.   If, in the judgment of  the  department  of  city  planning,  a
      proposed  revocable  consent  has  land use impacts or implications, the
      petition for the proposed revocable consent shall be subject  to  review
      and  approval pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-c and section
      one hundred ninety-seven-d.
        e.     Notwithstanding  any  provision  of   this   charter   or   the
      administrative   code,  revocable  consents  to  construct  and  operate
      sidewalk cafes shall be reviewed pursuant to subchapter six  of  chapter
      two of title twenty of the administrative code.

      memorializing the terms and conditions of a franchise, revocable consent
      or concession shall contain adequate provisions by way of forfeiture  or
      otherwise  (1)  to  secure  efficiency  of  public service at reasonable
      rates, if a public  service  is  to  be  provided,  (2)  to  assure  the
      maintenance of the property of the city in good condition throughout the
      term  of  the agreement, and (3) to provide for adequate compensation to
      the city.

      franchise, revocable consent or concession shall contain an agreement by
      the  grantee  that  it  will  (1) permit the placement or display of the
      public health messages required by section 17-707 of the  code,  on  any
      property  subject to such franchise, revocable consent or concession, or
      any facility, plant, equipment or other property used in connection with
      such franchise, revocable consent or concession; and (2) bear any  costs
      associated with the posting of such public health messages and any costs
      in  terms of foregone advertising revenues associated with the placement
      or display of such public health messages.
        c. The responsible agency shall also monitor the  performance  of  the
      grantee and enforce the terms and conditions of any franchise, revocable
      consent or concession under its jurisdiction.

      The  franchise  and  concession  review  committee  in  the  case  of  a
      franchise, or the responsible agency in the case of a revocable consent,
      shall  hold a public hearing on the proposed agreement memorializing the
      terms and conditions of each proposed  franchise  or  revocable  consent
      before  final  approval  of  the proposed franchise or consent. Any such
      public  hearing  conducted  by  the  franchise  and  concession   review
      committee  shall  be  held  within  thirty  days  of the filing with the
      committee by the responsible agency of a proposed  agreement  containing
      the  terms and conditions of the proposed franchise.  No hearing held by
      the franchise and concession review  committee  or  by  the  responsible

      terms and conditions of the proposed agreement shall have been published
      for  at  least  fifteen  days,  except  Sundays  and   legal   holidays,
      immediately prior thereto in the City Record, nor until a notice of such
      hearing, indicating the place where copies of the proposed agreement may
      be  obtained  by all those interested therein, shall have been published
      at least twice at the  expense  of  the  proposed  grantee  in  a  daily
      newspaper  designated by the mayor which is published in the city of New
      York and having a circulation in the borough or boroughs  in  which  the
      affected  property  of  the  city  is  located and a weekly newspaper or
      newspapers designated by the mayor which are published in  the  city  of
      New  York  and have a circulation in the community district or districts
      in which the affected property of the city is located.  In the  event  a
      franchise  or  revocable consent relates to property of the city located
      in more than one borough, notice of hearing in a weekly newspaper  shall
      not  be required; however, in that event, notice of hearing in two daily
      newspapers, and mailing by the  grantee,  no  later  than  fifteen  days
      immediately  prior  to the date of the public hearing, of such notice to
      the borough presidents and community boards and council members in whose
      districts the affected  property  of  the  city  is  located,  shall  be
      required.  In  the case of a franchise for a bus route which crosses one
      or more borough boundaries, notice of  hearing  in  a  weekly  newspaper
      shall  not be required; however, in that event, notice of hearing in two
      daily newspapers, and mailing by the grantee, no later than fifteen days
      immediately prior to the date of the public hearing, of such  notice  to
      the borough presidents and community boards and council members in whose
      districts  the  bus  route is located, and posting of such notice in the
      buses operating upon such route, shall be required.

      concession  review committee is hereby established.  The committee shall
      consist of the following officials or their designees:   the mayor,  who
      shall  serve  as  chair;  the  director  of the office of management and
      budget; the corporation counsel; the  comptroller;  and  one  additional
      appointee  of  the  mayor.    Whenever  the committee reviews a proposed
      franchise or concession or the  procedures  for  granting  a  particular
      concession, the borough president of the borough in which such franchise
      or  concession  is  located or his or her designee shall also serve as a
      member of the committee.  If such a franchise, concession  or  procedure
      relates  to    more  than  one borough, the borough presidents   of such
      boroughs shall designate one  of  such  borough  presidents  or  another
      individual  to  serve  as  a  member of the committee for the purpose of
      considering such matter.
        b. The mayor shall designate a public officer or employee  to  act  as
      the  clerk of the committee who shall be responsible for maintaining the
      records and minutes of the committee and performing such other duties as
      may be required.
        c. The committee shall act by the affirmative vote of  at  least  four
      members  except that the affirmative vote of at least five members shall
      be required to approve a franchise agreement.
        d. The committee shall:
        (1) adopt  rules  establishing  procedures  for  granting  concessions
      through   public  bidding  or  by  other  means  designed  to  ensure  a
      competitive and fair process;
        (2) review and approve the granting of concessions that  are  proposed
      to  be  granted  pursuant  to procedures that differ from the procedures
      established by the rules of the committee; provided, however,  that  the
      committee  need not review awards of concessions that are not subject to
      renewal and have a term of less than thirty days;
        (3) determine whether each franchise  agreement  proposed  by  a  city
      agency is consistent with the request for proposal or other solicitation
      pursuant  to which such agreement was negotiated and require appropriate
      modifications  to  any  such  agreements  to  correct  any   significant
      inconsistencies; and
        (4)  review  and  approve  the  selection  of  franchisees pursuant to
      subdivision f of section three hundred sixty-three.

      franchise  and  concession review committee or obtaining the approval of
      the committee prior to granting the concession.
        b. The city planning commission shall adopt  rules  that  either  list
      major  concessions  or  establish  a procedure for determining whether a
      concession is a major concession.   A "major concession"  shall  mean  a
      concession  that  has  significant land use impacts and implications, as
      determined by the  commission,  or  for  which  the  preparation  of  an
      environmental   impact   statement  is  required  by  law.    All  major
      concessions shall be subject to review and approval pursuant to  section

      department of transportation shall compile and keep up to date a listing
      of  all  current  franchises  and  revocable  consents  which  shall  be
      available to the public and shall include the date, terms, names of  the
      parties, description of the permitted use and location of each franchise
      and revocable consent.  Such listing shall be arranged and indexed so as
      to  enable  a  member of the public to determine what current franchises
      and revocable  consents  involving  use  or  occupancy  of  streets  and
      sidewalks  have  been  granted  for  any  location  in  the city and the

Section 378. ::    
        
     
        §   378.   Transition.  a.  All  franchises,  revocable  consents  and
      concessions granted prior to the effective date of  this  section  shall
      remain in full force and effect for the terms which they were granted.
        b. Not later than the first day of March, nineteen hundred ninety, the
      mayor shall designate a single agency as the responsible agency for each
      type  of  franchise  currently  granted  by  the city. If such an agency
      intends to continue granting any such  type  of  franchise,  the  agency
      shall  submit  to the council a proposed authorizing resolution for such
      type of franchise at least two years, or such shorter period as  may  be
      approved  by the franchise and concession review committee, prior to the
      earliest expiration  date  of  any  existing  franchise  of  that  type;
