      each  agency that delivers local services, or is responsible for capital
      projects, within any community  district  shall  (1)  consult  with  the
      community board for such community district through appropriate officers
      and  employees  of  the  agency,  and  (2)  consider the community board
      statements  of  expense  and  capital  budget  priorities  submitted  in
