        §  225.    Budgetary  responsibilities  of  the mayor, the director of
      management and budget and the comptroller.   a.   The mayor  shall  each
      year,  in  accordance  with  the provisions of this chapter, prepare and
      submit to the council a preliminary budget and an executive budget  each
      of  which  shall  present a complete financial plan for the city and its
      agencies for the ensuing fiscal year, setting forth  proposed  operating
      and  capital  expenditures,  proposed  interfund  transfers, anticipated
      revenues and any other anticipated sources and uses of funds. Each  such
      budget  shall  consist of three parts:  the expense budget,  which shall
      set forth proposed appropriations for the operating expenses of the city
      including debt service;  the capital budget and program, which shall set
      forth proposed appropriations  for  capital  projects  for  the  ensuing
      fiscal  year  and  the  three succeeding fiscal years; and   the revenue
      budget,  which shall set forth the estimated revenues  and  receipts  of
      the city.
        b.  There shall be an office of management and budget in the executive
      office of the mayor, the head of which shall be director  of  management
      and budget who shall be appointed by the mayor.  It shall be the duty of
      the  director  to  perform  all  such duties in regard to the budget and
      related matters as the mayor may direct.  The director of management and
      budget shall have the power, personally or through  representatives,  to
      survey  each  agency  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  its budgetary
      requirements.  The director may require any agency, or  any  officer  or
      employee,  to  furnish  data  and  information  and  to answer inquiries
      pertinent to the exercise of any of the director's duties in  regard  to
      the budget and related matters.
        c.    The comptroller shall produce timely analyses of the preliminary
      and executive  budgets including evaluations of the  recommendations  of
      the  borough  presidents,  as  well  as  those  of the mayor, and of the
      assumptions and methodologies used by the mayor in  making  the  revenue
      estimates contained in such budgets.
