*§ 11-128 Payment of real property taxes by electronic funds transfer.* ::


a. Definition. "Electronic funds transfer" shall mean any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft or similar paper instrument, which is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephonic instrument or computer or magnetic tape so as to order, instruct or authorize a financial institution to debit or credit an account.

b. Authority. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the department of finance may accept and, as authorized by this section, require payment of real property taxes by electronic funds transfer, and may authorize a designee to accept such payments. The department of finance, or its designee, may take all actions necessary to complete and administer such transactions, including but not limited to requesting and collecting necessary information and the debiting of specified accounts as provided for by this section.

c. Participation. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the commissioner may require the payment of real property taxes by electronic funds transfer for properties with annual real property tax liability equal to or greater than three hundred thousand dollars. The owner of any such real property, or the person or entity authorized by such owner to pay real property taxes on such real property, shall be required to enroll in an electronic payment program to make such payments, including any arrears in real property taxes on such real property, by electronic funds transfer, either by payment initiated by the taxpayer as described in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section or by authorizing the department of finance to debit the relevant account as described in paragraph two of subdivision d of this section.

   1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where a taxpayer pays real property taxes for more than one property by a single payment, and the total annual real property tax liability for such properties is equal to or greater than three hundred thousand dollars, the total annual real property tax liability for such properties shall be used to determine whether the taxes for a property must be paid by electronic funds transfer.

   2. (i) Where real property taxes are paid for more than one taxpayer by a single bill or paid by a single entity, including but not limited to a mortgage escrow agent as defined in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, if the total amount paid is equal to or greater than three hundred thousand dollars annually, such amount shall be used to determine whether the taxpayer or entity is required to participate in an electronic funds transfer program.

      (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term "mortgage escrow agent" shall include every banking organization, federal savings bank, federal savings and loan association, federal credit union, bank, trust company, licensed mortgage banker, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, insurance corporation organized under the laws of any state other than New York, or any other person, entity or organization which, in the regular course of its business, requires, maintains or services escrow accounts in connection with mortgages on real property located in the city.

d. Electronic payment program. The owner of real property, or other person or entity authorized by such owner to pay real property taxes on real property for which payment must be made by electronic funds transfer under this section, may choose between participating in a taxpayer initiated payment program or an automatic debit program, as set forth in this subdivision and described in rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance.

   1. Taxpayer initiated program. In such a program, taxpayers initiate payment by electric funds transfer, including payment by fedwire.

   2. Automatic debit program. In such a program, taxpayers authorize the department of finance, or the department's designee as determined by the commissioner of finance, to debit the taxpayer's account for the amounts due.

e. Notification of participation requirements. For taxpayers or entities subject to this section, the department of finance shall mail notice of such requirement to the property owner or other party who has been designated to receive real property tax bills on an owner's registration card filed by such owner. Such notice shall include the date by which the owner or other party designated by such owner to pay real property taxes on the property must enroll in the electronic payment program.

f. Authorization. To administer the payment of real property taxes by electronic funds transfer by automatic debit as described in paragraph two of subdivision d of this section, the department of finance may require that the party responsible for the payment of real property taxes:

   1. execute an electronic funds transfer agreement with the department of finance or its designee, on a form approved by the department of finance. Such form may be in a format designated by the commissioner, including an electronic format. The agreement shall require that the taxpayer authorize the department of finance or its designee to debit such account on the last date by which the real property taxes may be paid without the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable law; and

   2. furnish the department of finance or its designee with information to enable the department of finance to complete the electronic funds transfer transaction. Such information shall include, but not be limited to, the name and address of the bank from which an electronic funds transfer shall be authorized, the account number from which the paymeent shall be authorized, the American Bankers Association (ABA) routing number of the bank where the taxpayer maintains an account and the borough, block and lot of the real property for which such payments are authorized.

g. Timely payment. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, where real property taxes are required to be made by electronic funds transfer pursuant to subdivision c of this section, payment of real property tax by electronic funds transfer shall be deemed timely and not subject to interest charges if:

   1. for taxpayers enrolled in a taxpayer initiated program pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, (i) the taxpayer properly initiates payment on the last date by which the real property taxes may be paid without the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable law; and (ii) on the last date by which the real property taxes may be paid without the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable law, such account contains sufficient funds to enable the successful completion of the electronic funds transfer; or

   2. for taxpayers enrolled in an automatic debit program pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision d of this section, (i) the department of finance or its designee has been authorized to debit the taxpayer's account on the last date by which the real property taxes may be paid without the accrual of interest in accordance with applicable law; (ii) such account is properly identified; and (iii) on the date such payment is due, such account contains sufficient funds to enable the successful completion of the electronic funds transfer.

h. Charge on returned payments. Where the department of finance or its designee attempts to debit a taxpayer's account pursuant to a valid electronic funds transfer agreement and is unable to successfully complete the electronic funds transfer due to insufficient funds or other cause not attributable to the department of finance or its designee, in addition to any interest accruing from the late payment of taxes in accordance with applicable law, the same fee that is imposed for a dishonored check pursuant to section eighty-five of the general municipal law shall be imposed on the affected real property, and such fee may be collected in the manner provided in such section.

i. Hardship. If a taxpayer is unable to enroll in the electronic payment program required by subdivision c of this section or subsequent to enrollment becomes unable to make payments by electronic funds transfer as required by this section, the taxpayer may seek a waiver by written application to the department of finance that sets forth the reason for such inability. Such waiver may be granted in the discretion of the commissioner of finance, who may consider such criteria as:

   1. the hardship, whether financial or practical, created by participation in the electronic funds transfer program for the taxpayer seeking the waiver;

   2. the length of time for which the waiver is requested; and

   3. any other factors that the commissioner may deem relevant. The commissioner shall issue a determination, in writing, within ten days of the department of finance's receipt of a waiver request pursuant to this subdivision, but no waiver shall be granted with respect to the payment of any installment of real property taxes that is due within thirty days of the date of the request for a waiver.

j. Confidentiality. The department of finance shall assure the confidentiality of information supplied by taxpayers in effecting electronic funds trasfers in accordance with applicable provisions of law. The provisions of article six of the public officers law shall not apply to any such information furnished by taxpayers subject to the requirements of this section.

k. Failure to pay by electronic funds transfer.

   1. With respect to any real property as to which real property taxes are required to be paid by electronic funds transfer under this section, but for which an installment of real property taxes is not paid by electronic funds transfer and is paid instead by any other method, including payment by check, (i) with respect to the first installment that is paid by any other method, including payment by check, the department of finance shall mail a warning notice to the taxpayer setting forth the requirement to make payment by electronic funds transfer and the penalties for failure to do so; and (ii) with respect to each and every subsequent installment that is paid by any other method, including payment by check, the department of finance shall impose a penalty charge in the amount of one percent of the amount of the tax installment that was required under this section to be paid by electronic funds transfer.

   2. Any penalty charge imposed under this subdivision shall be a lien against the real property for which the taxpayer failed to make a payment in the manner required by this section, and shall accrue interest at the same rate as is imposed on a delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 and may be sold, enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of this title.

l. Rules. The commissioner may promulgate rules necessary to implement this section.

*§ 11-130 Financial institution data match system for tax collection purposes.* ::


1. Definitions. As used in this section:

   (a) "Debt" means all liabilities, including unpaid tax, interest, and penalty, that the commissioner of finance is required by law to collect and that have been reduced to judgment by the docketing of a city tax warrant in the office of the county clerk of the appropriate county.

   (a) To assist the commissioner of finance in the collection of debts, the department of finance shall develop and operate a financial institution data match system for the purpose of identifying and seizing the non-exempt assets of tax debtors as identified by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner is authorized to designate a third party to develop and operate this system. Any third party designated by the commissioner to develop and operate a financial data match system shall keep all information it obtains from both the department and the financial institution confidential, and any employee, agent or representative of that third party is prohibited from disclosing that information to anyone other than the department or the financial institution.

   (b) Each financial institution doing business in the state of New York shall, in conjunction with the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized designee, develop and operate a data match system to facilitate the identification and seizure of non-exempt financial assets of tax debtors identified by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized designee. If a financial institution has a data match system developed or used to administer the child support enforcement programs of this state, and if that system is approved by the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized designee, the financial institution may use that system to comply with the provisions of this section.

3. Each financial institution shall provide identifying information each calendar quarter to the department of finance for each tax debtor identified by the department who or that maintains an account at the institution. The identifying information shall include the tax debtor's name, address, and social security number or other taxpayer identification number, and all account numbers and balances in each account.

4. A financial institution that complies with this section will not be liable under state or city law to any person for the disclosure of information to the commissioner or the commissioner's authorized designee, or any other action taken in good faith to comply with this section.

5. Both the financial institution furnishing a report to the commissioner under this section and the commissioner's authorized designee are prohibited from disclosing to the tax debtor that the name of the tax debtor has been received from or furnished to the commissioner, unless authorized in writing by the commissioner to do so. A violation of this subdivision will result in the imposition of a civil penalty equal to the greater of one thousand dollars or the amount in the account of the person to whom the disclosure was made for each instance of unauthorized disclosure by the financial institution. That civil penalty can be assessed and collected under this code as if that penalty were tax.

6. A financial institution may disclose to its depositors or account holders that the department of finance has the authority to request certain identifying information on certain depositors or account holders under the financial institution data match system for city tax collection purposes.






*§ 11-131 Voluntary disclosure and compliance program.* ::


a. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, there is hereby established a voluntary disclosure and compliance program, as described in this section, to be administered by the commissioner, for all eligible taxpayers as described in this section, owing any tax imposed or previously imposed under this title.

b. For purposes of the voluntary disclosure and compliance program established under this section, an eligible taxpayer is an individual, partnership, estate, trust, corporation, limited liability company, joint stock company, or any other company, trustee, receiver, assignee, referee, society, association, business or any other person subject to a tax imposed by this title and who meets the following criteria:

   (1) the taxpayer is not currently under audit by the department;

   (2) the taxpayer is one who is voluntarily disclosing a New York city tax liability that the department has not determined, calculated, researched or identified at the time of the disclosure;

   (3) the taxpayer is not currently a party to any criminal investigation being conducted by an agency of the state or any political subdivision thereof; and

   (4) the taxpayer is not seeking to disclose participation in a tax avoidance transaction that is a federal or New York state reportable or listed transaction.

c. Under the voluntary disclosure and compliance program, upon execution of a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement by the eligible taxpayer and the commissioner, the commissioner shall waive any applicable penalties for the following:

   (1) failure to pay any such tax liability;

   (2) failure to file a return or report with respect to any such tax liability; and

   (3) failure to pay estimated tax.

In addition, no criminal action or proceeding shall be brought against an eligible taxpayer relating to the tax liability covered by the agreement. This agreement shall not preclude the auditing of the returns filed to determine if those returns were completed in accordance with existing law and regulation. Intentional failure to pay all the taxes, plus related interest, pursuant to the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement entered into between the taxpayer and the commissioner, shall invalidate any waiver of penalty, invalidate the forbearance of any administrative or criminal action or proceeding.

d. To participate in the voluntary disclosure and compliance program, an eligible taxpayer must apply by submitting a disclosure statement in the form and manner prescribed by the commissioner. The disclosure statement shall contain all the information the commissioner reasonably deems necessary to effectively administer the program. As long as all the requirements of the voluntary disclosure and compliance program are met, no application shall be denied solely because the taxpayer has admitted that the delinquency was the result of willful or fraudulent conduct. Except in instances where the taxpayer has failed to comply with the terms of a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement, the commissioner shall not use the taxpayer's disclosure as evidence in any proceeding brought against the taxpayer or reveal the contents of the disclosure to any law enforcement or other agency. However, the disclosure of any returns or reports filed under this program with the secretary of the treasury of the United States, his or her delegates, or the proper tax officer of any state or city is permitted as otherwise provided for in this title.

e. (1) If the taxpayer and the tax liability are eligible under the voluntary disclosure and compliance program, the commissioner is authorized to enter into a voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement with the taxpayer. A voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement will be in a form to be established by the commissioner and include such terms as the commissioner may reasonably require to satisfy the taxpayer's disclosed tax obligations and enable and require the taxpayer to comply with the applicable provisions of this title in the future. The taxpayer must pay the tax and the related interest that are the subject of the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement when the agreement is executed or within the time stated on a bill issued to the taxpayer by the commissioner. In the event the commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer cannot make immediate full payment of the disclosed tax liability, the commissioner may enter into an installment payment program with the taxpayer for the payment of the tax and interest due. The commissioner may require a financial disclosure statement setting forth information concerning the taxpayer's current assets, liabilities, earnings, and other financial information before entering into an installment payment plan with the taxpayer. In addition to any other information and terms that the commissioner determines are appropriate, the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement shall provide that, if the taxpayer complies with the terms of the compliance agreement, the taxpayer will not be subject to any criminal tax prosecution in New York city for the conduct disclosed by the taxpayer.

   (2) If the taxpayer intentionally provides false material information or omits material information in his or her submissions to the commissioner, or attempts to intentionally defeat or evade a tax due pursuant to the agreement executed under this section, or intentionally fails to comply with the terms of the compliance agreement, such agreement shall be deemed rescinded.

f. Unless the commissioner on his or her own motion redetermines the amount of tax due, including applicable interest, no refund shall be granted or credit allowed with respect to any taxes, including applicable interest, paid under this program. The commissioner may promulgate regulations, issue forms and instructions, and take any and all other actions necessary to implement the provisions of the program established under this section.

g. The commissioner shall publicize the program provided for in this section so as to maximize public awareness of and participation in such program.

h. For purposes of this section, the term "taxpayer" includes any person required to collect any of the taxes specified in subdivision a of this section.

i. The voluntary disclosure and compliance application, the disclosure statement, the voluntary disclosure and compliance agreement, and other documents filed by an eligible taxpayer pursuant to the program established by this section are deemed to be reports and returns:

   (a) subject to the secrecy provisions of this title in the same manner and to the same extent as if such documents were referred to in any of the secrecy provisions of this title; and

   (b) for purposes of the criminal provisions of chapter forty of this title.

For purposes of this section, the term "tax software" includes, but is not limited to, an off-the-shelf software program loaded onto a tax return preparer's or taxpayer's computer, an online tax preparation application, or a tax preparation application hosted by the department.

b. The commissioner may, by rule, require that if a tax return preparer prepared more than one hundred original tax documents during any calendar year beginning on or after January first, two thousand nine, and if, in any succeeding calendar year that tax return preparer prepares one or more authorized tax documents using tax software, then, for that succeeding calendar year and for each subsequent calendar year thereafter, all authorized tax documents prepared by that tax return preparer must be filed electronically, in accordance with instructions prescribed by the commissioner.

c. The commissioner may, by rule, require that if a taxpayer does not utilize a tax return preparer to prepare an authorized tax document during any calendar year beginning on or after January first, two thousand ten, but instead prepares that document itself using tax software, then, for that calendar year and for each subsequent calendar year thereafter, all authorized tax documents prepared by the taxpayer using tax software must be filed electronically, in accordance with instructions prescribed by the commissioner.

d. The commissioner may, by rule, require that any tax liability or other amount due shown on, or required to be paid with, an authorized tax document required to be filed electronically pursuant to subdivision b or c of this section must be paid by the taxpayer electronically, in accordance with instructions prescribed by the commissioner.

e. Failure to electronically file or electronically pay. The commissioner may, by rule, impose penalties for failing to electronically file or electronically pay as follows:

   (1) If a tax return preparer is required to file authorized tax documents electronically pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and that preparer fails to file one or more of those documents electronically, then that preparer will be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each failure to electronically file an authorized tax document, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. For purposes of this paragraph, reasonable cause shall include, but not be limited to, a taxpayer's election not to electronically file the authorized tax document.

   (2) If a taxpayer is required to electronically pay any tax liability or other amount due shown on, or required to be paid with, an authorized tax document required to be filed electronically pursuant to subdivision b or c of this section, and that taxpayer fails to electronically pay one or more of those liabilities or other amounts due, then that taxpayer will be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each failure to electronically pay.

   (3) The penalties provided for by this subdivision must be paid upon notice and demand, and will be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the tax to which the electronic transaction relates. However, if the electronic transaction relates to another matter administered by the commissioner of finance, then the penalty will be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as prescribed by the chapter of the code that relates to collection of the general corporation tax.

f. Any provision of the New York city charter or this code requiring electronic payment or electronic filing of a tax return is not affected by this section and will remain in full force and effect.

g. The commissioner of finance is authorized to promulgate any rules necessary to implement this section.

b. Whenever any block boundaries shall be changed or any new or additional blocks of land shall be formed in such counties by the opening or closing of any street, avenue, road, boulevard or parkway or otherwise, the department of finance shall cause such maps to be altered to show the changes in the boundaries of a block and the formation of such new or additional blocks, and to cause such blocks, the boundaries of which have been altered, and such new or additional blocks, to be numbered on such maps with such block numbers as such department may determine. The commissioner of finance, or an officer or employee of the department designated by the commissioner, shall certify and file annually with the register and county clerk in each of such counties a list of the numbers of the blocks, the boundaries of which have been altered, and a list of the numbers of new or additional blocks which have been formed.

a. Where real property is income-producing property, the owner shall be required to submit annually to the department not later than the first day of June, a statement of all income derived from and all expenses attributable to the operation of such property as follows:

   (1) Where the owner's books and records reflecting the operation of the property are maintained on a calendar year basis, the statement shall be for the calendar year preceding the date the statement shall be filed.

   (2) Where the owner's books and records reflecting the operation of the property are maintained on a fiscal year basis for federal income tax purposes, the statement shall be for the last fiscal year concluded as of the first day of May preceding the date the statement shall be filed.

   (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, where the owner of the property has not operated the property and is without knowledge of the income and expenses of the operation of the property for the entire year for which the income and expense statement is required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph one or paragraph two of this subdivision, then an income and expense statement shall not be required for such year. Such owner is, however, subject to the requirements of paragraph four of subdivision d of this section.

   (4) The commissioner may for good cause shown extend the time for filing an income and expense statement by a period not to exceed thirty days, or in the case of residential class two properties held in the cooperative or condominium form of ownership, by a period not to exceed sixty days. The filing of the income and expense statement within the time prescribed by this paragraph shall be considered timely filed.

c. The form on which such statement shall be submitted shall be prepared by the commissioner and copies of such form shall be made available at the offices of the department in the county in which the property is located. The commissioner may, by rule, require such statement to be submitted electronically in such form and such manner as the commissioner may determine.

d. (1)    In the event that an owner of income-producing property fails to file an income and expense statement within the time prescribed in subdivision a of this section (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), such owner shall be subject to a penalty in an amount not to exceed three percent of the assessed value of such income-producing property determined for the current fiscal year in accordance with section fifteen hundred six of the charter provided, however, that if such statement is not filed by the thirty-first day of December, the penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed four percent of such assessed value. If, in the year immediately following the year in which an owner fails to file by the thirty-first of December, the owner again fails to file an income and expense statement within the time prescribed in subdivision a of this section (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), such owner shall be subject to a penalty in an amount not to exceed five percent of the assessed value of such property determined for the current fiscal year. Such owner shall also be subject to a penalty of up to five percent of such assessed value in any year immediately succeeding a year in which a penalty of up to five percent could have been imposed, if in such succeeding year the owner fails to file an income and expense statement within the time prescribed in subdivision a of this section (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing). The penalties prescribed in this paragraph shall be imposed by the commissioner after notice and an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to cure the failure to file. The penalties prescribed in this paragraph shall be a lien on such income-producing property when entered by the commissioner in the records in which charges against the property are to be entered, and shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on such property. Such lien shall be a tax lien within the meaning of sections 11-319 and 11-401 of this code and may be collected, sold, enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters two, three and four of title eleven of this code or may be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of section thirteen hundred fifty-four of the real property actions and proceedings law. If any such penalties are not paid within thirty days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the commissioner to receive interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable to such property for a delinquent tax on real property, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. The penalties prescribed in this paragraph may also be collected in an action brought against the owner of the income-producing property in a court of competent jurisdiction. The institution of any such action shall not suspend or bar the right to pursue any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such penalties.

   (2) The tax commission shall deny a hearing on any objection to the assessment of property for which an income and expense statement is required and has not been timely filed.

   (3) Where an income and expense statement required under the provisions of this section has not been timely filed, the commissioner may compel by subpoena the production of the books and records of the owner relevant to the income and expenses of the property, and may also make application to any court of competent jurisdiction for an order compelling the owner to furnish the required income and expense statement.

   (4) An owner of real property who is not required to submit an income and expense statement pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision a of this section or the rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision g of this section shall submit to the department, annually on or before the first day of June, or on such other schedule as determined by rule of the commissioner, a claim of exclusion from the filing requirement in a form approved by the commissioner. The commissioner may for good cause shown extend the time for submitting a claim of exclusion by a period not to exceed thirty days, or in the case of residential class two properties held in the cooperative or condominium form of ownership, by a period not to exceed sixty days. The filing of the claim of exclusion within the time prescribed by this paragraph shall be considered timely filed. In the event that an owner who is required to submit a claim of exclusion fails to submit such claim within the time prescribed by this paragraph or by the rules of the commissioner, such owner shall be subject to a penalty. Such penalty shall be imposed by the commissioner after notice and an opportunity to be heard, and an opportunity to cure the failure to submit a claim of exclusion, and shall be collected and enforced, including the imposition of interest for late payment, in the same manner as the penalties for failure to file an income and expense statement as provided in paragraph one of this subdivision. Such penalty shall not exceed the following amounts:

      (i) one hundred dollars for failure to submit a claim of exclusion in one year;

      (ii) five hundred dollars for failure to submit a claim of exclusion in two consecutive years;

      (iii) one thousand dollars for failure to submit a claim of exclusion in three consecutive years or more.

   (5) Notwithstanding paragraph four of this subdivision, an owner of real property described in the categories below is not required to submit a claim of exclusion:

      (i) property that has an assessed valuation of forty thousand dollars or less;

      (ii) residential property containing ten or fewer dwelling units;

      (iii) property classified in class one or two as defined in article eighteen of the real property tax law containing six or fewer dwelling units and one retail store; or

      (iv) special franchise property that is assessed pursuant to article six of the real property tax law.

   (6) The department shall inform owners of income producing property, other than owners of the property described in paragraph five of this subdivision, of the requirement to file an income and expense statement, or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, on the property tax bill for payment of the installment of real property tax that is due and payable on the first day of January and on the notice of property value. Such notification shall also inform the owner of such property that a penalty and interest may be imposed on such owner for failure to submit such claim, and that any penalties or interest imposed on such owner shall constitute a lien on such property.

   (7) No later than thirty days prior to the imposition of a penalty prescribed in paragraphs one and four of this subdivision, the commissioner shall publish on the website of the department a list of all property for which an income and expense statement, or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this section was not timely filed. Such list shall contain the borough, block, lot, address, zip code, and tax class of the property. No later than the first day of February of each calendar year, the commissioner shall publish on the website of the department a list of all property for which an income and expense statement or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this section was not timely filed. Such list shall contain the borough, block, lot, address, zip code, and tax class of the property, the penalty amount imposed by the department for failure to comply with the provisions of this section, and, to the extent practicable, the number of consecutive years the property owner has failed to file an income and expense statement, or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion.

   (8) In cases where the closing or finalizing of the sale of real property precedes the publication of the lists described in paragraph seven of this subdivision or the first property tax bill to reflect a penalty imposed on such property for the failure to file an income and expense statement or, if applicable, a claim of exclusion, required to be filed pursuant to this section, the commissioner may waive such penalty and cancel any lien imposed as a result of such penalty, as may be described in guidelines prescribed by the commissioner, upon request of the owner of such property.

e. As used in this section, the term "income-producing property" means property owned for the purpose of securing an income from the property itself, but shall not include property with an assessed value of forty thousand dollars or less, or residential property containing ten or fewer dwelling units or property classified in class one or two as defined in article eighteen of the real property tax law containing six or fewer dwelling units and one retail store.

The council may by resolution adopt an interest rate to be applicable to the aforementioned parcels and may specify in such resolution the date on which such interest rate is to take effect. This subdivision shall not apply to any fiscal year beginning on or after July first, two thousand five.

h. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the recommendation transmitted by the banking commission to the city council relative to the proposed rate of interest to be charged during the fiscal year of the city commencing July first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine in the case of nonpayment of real estate taxes, or contained in the resolution adopted by the council in accordance with such recommendation, the council hereby sets the interest rate to be charged during the fiscal year of the city commencing July first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine for nonpayment of real estate taxes at eighteen per centum per annum where the annual tax on a parcel is more than two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars or where the parcel consists of vacant or unimproved land.

i. The interest mentioned in the foregoing subdivisions of this section shall be paid over and accounted for from time to time by such commissioner of finance as a part of the tax collected by him or her.

j. When an installment agreement has been entered into pursuant to any of the provisions of chapter four of this title, during the period beginning on the date this subdivision takes effect and ending April thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-two, the commissioner of finance shall, notwithstanding any higher rate of interest prescribed pursuant to applicable law, and unless a lower rate of interest is applicable to a parcel covered by such an agreement, charge, collect and receive interest on the arrears due and payable under such agreement, to be calculated at the rate of ten percent per annum from May first, nineteen hundred eighty-two to the date of payment of each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to May first, nineteen hundred eighty-two shall not be affected by the provisions of this subdivision but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner and at the rates prescribed pursuant to applicable law. Such ten percent rate of interest shall be applicable only if, as of May first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, (i) there has been no default in such agreement, and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. Where an installment agreement has been entered into prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-two pursuant to the provisions of either paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 prior to March fourteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-nine or of subdivision a of section 11-405 or subdivision h of section 11-409 of chapter four of this title and said agreement is current as to both installment payments and current taxes, assessments and other legal charges, the commissioner of finance, on application of the party who entered into such agreement, may cancel said agreement and enter into a new agreement containing the terms provided on May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-two. If any such prior agreement is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments due and payable under such agreement on or after May first, nineteen hundred eighty-two shall be subject to interest at the rate and under the conditions set forth above. In the event of any subsequent default or failure to make timely payment of any installment payment or current tax, assessment or other legal charge, the ten percent rate of interest specified in this subdivision shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive interest in the manner and at the rates prescribed pursuant to applicable law.

k. 1. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, but subject to the exception contained in paragraph two of this subdivision, in the case of an installment of tax on real property described in paragraph b of subdivision four of section fifteen hundred nineteen of the city charter, interest shall be charged, received and collected at the rate established pursuant to this section if such installment shall remain unpaid in whole or in part on the date on which it shall become due and payable. This paragraph shall not apply to any installment of tax that becomes due and payable on or after July first, two thousand five.

   2. If the tax rate for any fiscal year of the city has not been set by the fifteenth day of June preceding the start of such fiscal year, interest shall not be charged, received and collected with respect to the first installment of tax which is due and payable on the first day of July in such fiscal year if such installment is paid on or before the extended payment date. For this purpose, the term "extended payment date" means the date which falls the same number of days after the first day of July in such fiscal year as the number of days the date such tax rate is set falls after such fifteenth day of June. This paragraph shall not apply to any installment of tax that becomes due and payable on or after July first, two thousand five.

l. No later than the fifth day following the date of enactment of this subdivision in the year nineteen hundred ninety and no later than May twenty-fifth of each succeeding year, the banking commission shall transmit a written recommendation to the council of proposed interest rates to be charged for nonpayment of taxes on real property in those cases in which the annual tax on a parcel, other than a parcel which consists of vacant or unimproved land, is not more than two thousand seven hundred fifty dollars. In making such recommendations, the banking commission shall consider the prevailing interest rates charged for commercial loans extended to prime borrowers by commercial banks operating in the city. In the case of any such parcel with respect to which the real property taxes are held in escrow and paid to the commissioner of finance by a "mortgage escrow agent," as that term is defined in section fifteen hundred nineteen of the city charter, the proposed rate shall be at least six percent per annum greater than such prevailing prime rate, and in the case of all other such parcels, the proposed rate shall be at least equal to such prevailing prime rate. The council may by resolution adopt interest rates to be applicable to the aforementioned parcels and may specify in such resolution the dates on which such interest rates are to take effect. In the event the council does not adopt interest rates as provided in this subdivision, the interest rates otherwise specified in this section shall be applicable. This subdivision shall not apply to any fiscal year beginning on or after July first, two thousand five.

(e-1) Report on recommendation. The banking commission's recommendation provided pursuant to subdivision e of this section shall include a report describing the factors considered when determining the recommendation and the rationale for the use of such factors.

For this purpose, the term "extended payment date" means the date which falls the same number of days after the first day of July in such fiscal year as the number of days the date such tax rate is set falls after such fifteenth day of June.

(g) For purposes of this section, property held in the cooperative form of ownership shall not be deemed to have an assessed value of over two hundred fifty thousand dollars if the property's assessed value divided by the number of residential dwelling units is two hundred fifty thousand dollars or less per unit.

The tax commission shall have power to remit or reduce a tax imposed upon real property where lawful cause therefor is shown or where such tax is found to be excessive or otherwise erroneous, but such remission or reduction shall be made only with respect to an assessment for which an application for correction has been made pursuant to section one hundred sixty-three of the charter, and no such remission or reduction shall be made when a claim to correct the assessment or recover the tax would be barred by passage of time or other adequate defense, or when, at the time that the determination is rendered, applications for correction or other proceedings are pending to review the assessment of such property for more than one subsequent fiscal year.

Any increase in assessed value from the preceding year in excess of the physical increase reflected in the current assessed value, such physical increase limited as provided in the preceding sentence, shall be subject to the limitations on increases provided in subdivisions one, two and three of section eighteen hundred five of the real property tax law. In no event shall the assessed value of the affected real property appearing on an assessment roll completed for any given year from two thousand fifteen to two thousand twenty exceed what the assessed value would have been that year but for any physical decreases or physical increases reflected in the assessed values on the assessment rolls completed from two thousand thirteen to two thousand twenty.

   b.

Notwithstanding section fifteen hundred twelve of the charter and any other provision to the contrary, the commissioner of finance is authorized to correct as provided in this paragraph the assessed value of affected real property appearing on the assessment roll completed in two thousand fifteen. Such correction shall be made no later than ninety days after the effective date of a local law adopted in accordance with this section.

For purposes of this paragraph, if improvements on the property located below grade were not included in the total square footage of the improvements on the property for the assessment roll completed in two thousand twelve, such improvements shall not be included in the total square footage for subsequent assessment rolls if the improvements were moved above grade or other building elevations were constructed on the property to prevent or mitigate flooding as part of reconstruction or repair in connection with the damage caused by the severe storm that occurred on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth of October, two thousand twelve.

      (b) Abatement limitations. 

         (i) The amount of abatement under subdivision c of this section shall not exceed the certified reasonable cost of the conversion, alteration or improvement, as determined under regulations of the department of housing preservation and development, provided that the amount of certified reasonable cost eligible for abatement under this section shall not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for a dwelling unit of three and one-half rooms, as determined under the applicable zoning resolution, and a comparable amount for dwelling units of other sizes, determined under regulations of the department of housing preservation and development, and further provided that the amount of certified reasonable cost eligible for abatement under this section may exceed fifteen thousand dollars or such comparable amount per dwelling unit, but not more than twenty-five percent above such amount, upon application of the property owner and a determination by the department of housing preservation and development that:

      (c) Exemption limitations. 

         (i) The increase in assessed valuation of the real property resulting from the conversion, alteration or improvement under subdivision b of this section, shall be exempt from taxation as provided in this section, only to the extent provided in this subparagraph, provided that this subparagraph shall not apply to any conversions, alterations or improvements commenced on or after June first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, unless such conversions, alterations or improvements are carried out in buildings or structures located in the borough of Manhattan south of or adjacent to the south side of one hundred tenth street. The amount of the increased assessed valuation that is exempt from taxation shall depend on the amount of the total assessed value per dwelling unit calculated by dividing the amount of the total assessed valuation of the property, as determined under the real property tax law, by the number of dwelling units in the building after completion of the conversion, alteration or improvement. The amount of increased assessed valuation that will be exempt from taxation for buildings with total assessed valuation per dwelling unit of less than thirty-eight thousand dollars shall be calculated pursuant to the following formula:

            (A) any portion of total assessed valuation of the property attributable to the first eighteen thousand dollars of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit, to the extent it represents increased assessed valuation, shall be one hundred percent exempt;

            (B) any portion of total assessed valuation attributable to the next four thousand dollars of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit, to the extent it represents increased assessed valuation, shall be seventy-five percent exempt;

            (D) any portion of total assessed valuation attributable to the next four thousand dollars of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit, to the extent it represents increased assessed valuation, shall be twenty-five percent exempt;

            (E) any portion of total assessed valuation attributable to the next eight thousand dollars of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit, to the extent it represents increased assessed valuation per dwelling unit, shall be fully taxable. Property with a total assessed valuation per dwelling unit of thirty-eight thousand dollars or more shall not be eligible for a tax exemption under this section.

         (ii) In calculating the amount of increased assessed valuation that will be exempt from taxation pursuant to the formula in clause (i) of this subparagraph, the full amount of total assessed valuation that does not represent increased assessed valuation shall be applied in such formula prior to the inclusion of any amount of increased assessed valuation.

         (iii) Where the real property is occupied in part for residential purposes and in part for non-residential purposes, the assessed valuation of the property shall be appropriately allocated between the residential and non-residential portions. In computing the total assessed valuation per dwelling unit under this subparagraph, only the amount of valuation so allocated to the residential portion shall be considered.

         (iv) Commencing with the assessment roll for the year nineteen hundred eighty-four, where there has been a change in the level of assessment from the assessment roll of the prior year of properties receiving exemptions under this section, the department of finance may petition the state board to certify the percentage of such change for the purposes of this section. In such petition, the department of finance shall submit such information as the state board shall require in order to certify the percentage of such change. The state board may also make such a certification on its own motion. Upon receipt of such certification from the state board, the department of housing preservation and development may modify the dollar values of total assessed valuation per dwelling unit in clause (i) of this subparagraph to reflect the percentage change in the level of assessment as shown in such certification. As used in this subparagraph, the term "change in the level of assessment" means the net increase or decrease in the assessed valuation of properties in the assessing unit that received exemptions under this section in the current year as compared to those that received exemptions under this section in the prior year as a result of assessing such properties at a higher or lower ratio of full value.

         (v) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (i) of this subparagraph, the department of housing preservation and development may reduce or remove the limitations on the exemption from taxation provided in such clause with respect to a particular property undergoing alteration or improvement, upon application of the property owner and a determination by such department that the increased benefit will increase the number of dwelling units that will be affordable to persons of low and moderate income, and the increased benefit is necessary to make economically viable units or improvement in the quality of dwelling units that will be affordable to persons of low or moderate income.

            (B) As used in this subparagraph, the term "persons of low or moderate income" shall mean persons who would qualify for housing subsidies pursuant to section two hundred thirty-five of the national housing act, as amended, at one hundred thirty-five percent of the income limitations provided therein.

            (C) Upon receiving an application under this subparagraph in proper form, the department of housing preservation and development shall immediately submit it to the community board for the area in which the project is located, which may, within forty-five days of receiving it and after a public hearing, make recommendations to the department as to the application. The department shall act on the application within sixty days of receiving it from the property owner in proper form, but not before expiration of the time for the community board to make its recommendations, unless the board has acted sooner.

      (d) The department of housing preservation and development may set forth preliminarily the terms of a determination under subparagraph (b) or (c) of this paragraph prior to the commencement of the conversion, alteration or improvement. Any such determination shall take effect after completion of the work in accordance with the terms of the application made by the property owner.

      (e) Any determination of the department of housing preservation and development to increase an abatement under subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, or to reduce or remove the exemption limitations under subparagraph (c) of this paragraph shall state the basis for the determination and the data on which the determination was based. Such determination shall be published in the City Record for five consecutive days after the determination is rendered.

d-1.    (1) A group of multiple dwellings which was developed as a planned community and which is owned as two separate condominiums containing a total of ten thousand or more dwelling units shall be eligible for tax exemption and abatement as provided in this subdivision.

   (2) any increase in assessed valuation resulting from alterations or improvements financed with substantial governmental assistance to one or more multiple dwellings in a planned community described in paragraph one of this subdivision shall be exempt from taxation for local purposes. Such exemption shall be equal to the increase in the valuation which is subject to exemption under this paragraph for thirty years. After such period of time, the amount of such exempted assessed value shall be reduced by twenty percent in each succeeding year until the assessed value of the alterations or improvements is fully taxable. Such exemption may commence at the beginning of any tax quarter subsequent to the start of such alterations or improvements. In no event shall such alterations or improvements directly or indirectly result in an equalization increase in the assessed valuation of any multiple dwelling forming part of the planned community where such alterations or improvements are performed.

   (3) the taxes on a planned community described in paragraph one of this subdivision, including the land, may be abated by an amount not to exceed the greater of (i) one hundred fifty per centum of the certified reasonable cost of the alterations or improvements, as determined under the rules of the department of housing preservation and development, and (ii) the construction cost of the alterations or improvements identified in such rules. Such abatement shall not be effective for more than twenty years and the annual abatement of taxes in any consecutive twelve-month period shall not be greater than ten per centum of the total abatement granted and shall not exceed the amount of taxes payable in such consecutive twelve-month period. Such abatement shall begin no sooner than the first quarterly tax bill immediately following the completion of such alterations or improvements. The limitations set forth in the second paragraph of paragraph three of subdivision d of this section for multiple dwellings, buildings and structures owned as condominiums shall be inapplicable to benefits granted pursuant to this subdivision. Abatement benefits granted pursuant to this subdivision shall be apportioned among all of the condominium tax lots within the condominium in which the alterations or improvements are made, although such alterations or improvements may have been made to one or fewer than all of the multiple dwellings therein.

   (4) in the event that multiple alterations or improvements are undertaken in a planned community described in paragraph one of this subdivision and separate applications for benefits therefor are made, all requirements concerning physical condition of and compliance with law by the multiple dwellings in such planned community shall apply only upon completion of all such alterations or improvements, provided that all such alterations or improvements are completed within six years.

   (5) except as provided in this subdivision, all of the requirements imposed by this section on projects described in subdivision b of this section shall be applicable to alterations or improvements granted benefits pursuant to this subdivision.

   (6) this subdivision shall be applicable only to alterations or improvements completed prior to December thirty-first, two thousand five.

   (7) Alterations and improvements receiving tax benefits under this subdivision shall not be used as the basis of an application for a major capital improvement rent increase under state laws governing rent control and rent stabilization, provided, however, that such alterations and improvements may be eligible for a major capital improvement increase in an amount not to exceed the amount of the decrease in rents that occurs as a result of the installation of individual electrical metering for the residential units. Such major capital improvement increase shall be implemented on a per unit basis.

e. Notwithstanding any provision of this section or any other section of the code to the contrary, where such dwelling is in an area where a plan of redevelopment, program of neighborhood improvement, housing maintenance, demonstration rehabilitation or concentrated code enforcement is being carried out, the rents subsequent to conversion, alteration or improvement may exceed the maximum amount allowable pursuant to chapter four of title twenty-six of the code where necessity for the adjustment of such rents is certified by the department of housing preservation and development.

f. Subject to the provisions of subdivision d of this section, the department of housing preservation and development shall determine and certify the reasonable cost of any such conversions, alterations or improvements and eligibility for the benefits of this section and for that purpose may adopt rules and regulations, administer oaths to and take the testimony of any person, including but not limited to the owner of such property, may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of such persons and the production of such bills, books, papers or other documents as it shall deem necessary, may make preliminary estimates of the maximum reasonable cost of such conversions, alterations or improvements, may establish maximum allowable costs of specified units, fixtures or work in such conversions, alterations or improvements, and may require the submission of plans and specifications of such conversions, alterations or improvements, and may require the submission of plans and specifications of such conversions, alterations or improvements before the start thereof. Applications for certification shall include all bills and other documents showing the cost of construction or such other evidence of such cost as shall be satisfactory to the department of housing preservation and development, including, without limitation, certification of cost by a certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Applications for certification for a building eligible for benefits pursuant to paragraph three of subdivision d of this section, for alterations or improvements completed more than three years after its conversion to cooperative or condominium ownership, shall include such documentation of the sale price of dwelling units or stock allocated to such dwelling units as may be required by the department of housing preservation and development, including but not limited to certification of sales price by a certified public accountant. In addition, such applications shall contain the consent of the applicant to allow the department of housing preservation and development access to records, including but not limited to other tax records, as the department may deem appropriate to enforce such conditions of eligibility. Applications for certification filed for conversions, alterations or improvements completed after December thirty-first, two thousand eleven pursuant to paragraphs one through seven and paragraph nine of subdivision b of this section shall be made after completion and within thirty-six months following the start of construction of the conversion, alteration or improvement, except that applications for certification for alterations or improvements undertaken by a housing development fund company organized pursuant to article eleven of the private housing finance law, which are carried out with the substantial assistance of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local governmental agency or instrumentality or which are carried out in a property transferred from the city of New York shall be made after completion and within seventy-two months following the start of the construction of the alteration or improvement. Provided, however, the department of housing preservation and development is empowered to grant an extension of the period for application for any project carried out with the substantial assistance of loans, grants or subsidies from any federal, state or local governmental agency or instrumentality, if such application is made within seventy-two months from commencement of construction. Applications for certification pursuant to paragraph eight of subdivision b of this section shall be filed within twelve months of the date of completion as provided by such subdivision.

g. To the end that conversions, alterations or improvements in such property shall interfere as little as practicable with the clearance, rehabilitation or rebuilding of sub-standard and insanitary areas and shall be confined to buildings and structures which are structurally sound and comply with applicable provisions of law, eligibility for the benefits of this section shall be restricted to such buildings and structures which the department of housing preservation and development shall certify:

   (1) to be structurally sound and to comply with applicable provisions of law, as determined by the department of buildings, which certification shall be evidenced by a certificate describing the property involved; and

   (2) if in an area for which a final plan of clearance, replanning, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or redevelopment has been approved pursuant to article fifteen of the general municipal law, or if in an area for which an urban renewal plan or tests, studies or demonstrations have been approved pursuant to article fifteen of the general municipal law, to be improved in conformity with such replanning, reconstruction, rehabilitation, redevelopment, tests, studies, demonstrations or plan; and

   (3) if in an area where a program of local neighborhood improvement or housing maintenance is being carried out, to be in conformity with such program.

h. Application forms for the benefits of this section shall be filed with the department of finance within the time periods to be established by rules and regulations promulgated by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to subdivision m of this section. The department of finance shall certify the amount of taxes to be abated, pursuant to the certification of the department of housing preservation and development as herein provided. No such application shall be accepted unless accompanied by a copy of the certificate of the department of housing preservation and development both as to reasonable cost and as to eligibility as provided in subdivision f of this section.

i. The benefits of this section shall not apply:

   (1) except as provided in subdivision d of this section, to any existing dwelling which is not subject to the provisions of the emergency housing rent control law or to the city rent and rehabilitation law or to the city rent stabilization law or to the private housing finance law or to any federal law providing for supervision or regulation by the United States department of housing and urban development;

   (2) to any private dwelling, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, unless it is in an area where a plan of redevelopment or program of neighborhood improvement, housing maintenance, demonstration rehabilitation or concentrated code enforcement is being carried out and the department of housing preservation and development finds that the conversion, alteration or improvement is in conformity with such plan of redevelopment, or program of neighborhood improvement, housing maintenance, demonstration rehabilitation or concentrated code enforcement; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purposes of this section, a class A multiple dwelling may be deemed to include any garden-type maisonette dwelling project consisting of a series of dwelling units which together and in their aggregate were arranged or designed to provide three or more apartments and are provided as a group collectively with all essential services such as, but not limited to, water supply, house sewers and heat, and which are in existence and operated as a unit under single ownership on the date upon which an application for the benefits of this section is received by the department of housing preservation and development, even though certificates of occupancy were issued for portions thereof as private dwellings;

   (3) to any property receiving tax exemption or abatement concurrently for rehabilitation or new construction under any other provision of New York state or New York city law with the exception of any alteration or improvement to property receiving such tax exemption or abatement under the provisions of the private housing finance law, provided, however, that the benefits of this section shall not apply to any alterations or improvements done in connection with the refinancing, pursuant to section 223f of the national housing act, as amended, of a housing project organized pursuant to article two and article four of the private housing finance law;

   (4) to any multiple dwelling for ordinary repairs and normal replacement of maintenance items, as provided in paragraph one of subdivision a, hereof in the event that the dwelling thereof is receiving the benefits of this section for other ordinary repairs and normal replacement of maintenance items as of the December thirty-first preceding the date of application;

   (5) to the conversion of any building or structure, or portion thereof:

      (i)    (a) which is located within any district in the county of New York where a floor area ratio, as that term is defined in the zoning resolution of the city of New York, of fifteen or greater is permitted by said resolution, or

         (b) located in the city of New York where residential conversion as of right is not permitted by the zoning resolution, provided, however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this subparagraph, the benefits of this section shall apply to any building or structure or portion thereof which was purchased from the city of New York on or after January first, nineteen hundred and eighty and prior to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred and eighty-four and which was granted a variance for conversion to residential use by the board of standards and appeals prior to nineteen hundred and eighty-four which variance has expired, and which has been granted a variance for a conversion to residential use by the board of standards and appeals on or after January first, nineteen hundred and ninety-four and prior to June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and

      (ii) where such benefits are eliminated by regulations to be promulgated by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to subdivision m of this section, unless, in the case of a building or structure in the county of New York, construction actually commenced prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, pursuant to an alteration permit, or, in the case of a building or structure in the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens and Richmond, construction actually commenced prior to October first, nineteen hundred eighty-three, pursuant to an alteration permit. A copy of any proposed regulation pursuant to this paragraph shall be transmitted to the city council not less than sixty days prior to its publication in the City Record, pursuant to section eleven hundred five of the charter, and

      (iii) provided that the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to conversions pursuant to paragraph eight of subdivision b of this section.

   (6) to any conversion of or alteration or improvement, commenced on or after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, to any class B multiple dwelling or class A multiple dwelling used in whole or in part for single room occupancy, regardless of the status or use of the building after the conversion, alteration or improvement unless such conversion, alteration or improvement is carried out with the substantial assistance of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local agency or instrumentality.

   (7) to any conversion of or alteration or improvement, commenced on or after the effective date of this paragraph, to any property classified under the zoning resolution as a non-profit institution with sleeping accommodations, regardless of the status or use of the building after the conversion, alteration or improvement unless such conversion, alteration or improvement is carried out with the substantial assistance of grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local agency or instrumentality.

i-1. (a) For purposes of this subdivision, "substantial governmental assistance" shall mean:

         (i) grants, loans or subsidies from any federal, state or local agency or instrumentality in furtherance of a program for the development of affordable housing approved by the department of housing preservation and development, including, without limitation, financing or insurance provided by the state of New York mortgage agency or the New York city residential mortgage insurance corporation; or

         (ii) a written agreement between a housing development fund corporation and the department of housing preservation and development limiting the incomes of persons entitled to purchase shares or rent housing accommodations therein.

      (b) With respect to conversions, alterations or improvements completed on or after December thirty-first, two thousand eleven:

         (i) except as otherwise provided in this section with respect to multiple dwellings, buildings and structures owned and operated either by limited-profit housing companies established pursuant to article two of the private housing finance law or redevelopment companies established pursuant to article five of the private housing finance law, or with respect to a group of multiple dwellings that was developed as a planned community and that is owned as two separate condominiums containing a total of ten thousand or more dwelling units, any multiple dwelling, building or structure that is owned as a cooperative or a condominium that has an average assessed value per dwelling unit that exceeds the assessed valuation limitation as provided in paragraph (e) of this subdivision shall only be eligible for such benefits if the alterations or improvements for which such multiple dwelling, building or structure has applied for the benefits pursuant to this section were carried out with substantial governmental assistance, and

         (ii) no benefits pursuant to this section shall be granted for the conversion of any non-residential building or structure into a class A multiple dwelling unless such conversion was carried out with substantial governmental assistance.

      (c) If the conversions, alterations or improvements for which such multiple dwelling, building or structure has applied for benefits pursuant to this section are not completed on the date upon which such department of housing preservation and development inspects the items of work claimed in such application, the department of housing preservation and development shall require the applicant to pay two times the actual cost for any additional inspections needed to verify the completion of such conversion, alteration or improvement.

      (d) The revocation of benefits granted to any multiple dwelling, building or structure pursuant to this section shall not exempt any dwelling unit therein from continued compliance with the requirements of this section or of any local law or ordinance providing for benefits pursuant to this section.

      (e) Assessed value limitation.

         (i) For final assessment rolls to be completed prior to two thousand seventeen, the assessed value limitation shall be thirty thousand dollars.

         (ii) For the final assessment roll to be completed in two thousand seventeen, the assessed value limitation shall be thirty-two thousand dollars increased by the cost-of-living adjustment percentage of two thousand seventeen. For the purposes of this computation, the cost-of-living adjustment percentage of two thousand seventeen shall be equal to the "applicable increase percentage" used by the United States commissioner of social security to determine the monthly social security benefits payable in two thousand seventeen to individuals, as provided by subsection (i) of section four hundred fifteen of title forty-two of the United States code.

         (iii) For final assessment rolls to be completed in each ensuing year, the applicable assessed value limitation, cost-of-living adjustment percentage and applicable increase percentage shall all be advanced by one year, and the assessed valuation limitation shall be the previously applicable assessed value limitation increased by the new cost-of-living adjustment percentage. If there should be a year for which there is no applicable increase percentage due to a general benefit increase as defined by subdivision three of subsection (i) of section four hundred fifteen of title forty-two of the United States code, the applicable increase percentage for purposes of this computation shall be deemed to be the percentage which would have yielded that general benefit increase.

         (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the assessed value limitation shall not at any time exceed forty thousand dollars.

i-2. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law providing for benefits pursuant to this section, applications for exemption and/or abatement under this section shall be filed electronically if the department of housing preservation and development makes electronic filing available.

j. Notwithstanding the provisions of the multiple dwelling law, or any local law, ordinance, provisions of this code, rule or regulation, any dwelling to which alterations and improvements are made pursuant to this section and which did not require a certificate of occupancy on April second, nineteen hundred forty-five, may be occupied lawfully after such date upon the completion of such alterations and improvements without such a certificate being obtained, provided, however, that such alterations and improvements shall have been made in conformity with law and the applicable provisions for fire protection required by articles six and seven of the multiple dwelling law.

k. No owner of a dwelling to which the benefits of this section shall be applied, nor any agent, employee, manager or officer of such owner shall directly or indirectly deny to any person because of race, color, creed, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, age, religion, alienage or citizenship status, or the use of, participation in, or being eligible for a governmentally funded housing assistance program, including, but not limited to, the section 8 housing voucher program and the section 8 housing certificate program, 42 U.S.C. § 1437, et seq., or the senior citizen rent increase exemption program, pursuant to either chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code or section 26-509 of such code, any of the dwelling accommodations in such property or any of the privileges or services incident to occupancy therein. The term "disability" as used in this subdivision shall have the meaning set forth in section 8-102 of the code. Nothing in this subdivision shall restrict such consideration in the development of housing accommodations for the purpose of providing for the special needs of a particular group.

l. Any person who shall knowingly and willfully make any false statement as to any material matter in any application for the benefits of this section shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment for not more than ninety days, or both. The commissioner of the department of housing preservation and development may reduce or revoke past and future exemption or tax abatement authorized pursuant to this section if the application for tax exemption or tax abatement contains a false statement or false information as to a material matter or omits a material matter.

m. Each agency or department to which functions are assigned by this section may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for the effectuation of the purpose of this section.

n. The department of housing preservation and development may require a filing fee in an amount as provided by the rules and regulations promulgated by the department of housing preservation and development pursuant to subdivision m of this section.

o. Any tax abatement granted for a period of nine years to a multiple dwelling aided by a loan provided by the city of New York prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-one, shall upon application therefor be adjusted to extend for a period of up to twenty years, provided that the total abatement before and after such adjustment shall not exceed the total abatement to which such property was initially entitled under this section.

p. This section is enacted pursuant to the provisions of section four hundred eighty-nine of the real property tax law and subdivision two of section four hundred five of the private housing finance law.

q. No application for the benefits of this section shall be accepted by the department of finance if there are outstanding real estate taxes or water and sewer charges or payments in lieu of taxes which were due and owing as of the last day of the tax period preceding the date of such filing with the department of finance, provided that an applicant aided by article eight or article fifteen of the private housing finance law shall have such application accepted by the department of finance if there are no outstanding real estate taxes or water and sewer charges due and owing as of the last day of the tax period preceding commencement of construction.

r. In the event that any building or structure receiving the benefits of this section shall become operated exclusively for commercial, hotel or transient hotel use, the tax commission shall withdraw benefits granted herein pro- spectively.

s. The benefits of this section shall not apply to alterations or improvements to existing dwellings in existence on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-five where (i) such alterations or improvements were completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-five, and (ii) no dwelling units thereof on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-five had rentals which were subject to control by the city rent agency pursuant to chapter four of title twenty-six of the code. This subdivision shall not apply to alterations or improvements to any building or structure which is benefitted by mortgage insurance pursuant to section two hundred thirteen of the national housing act for applications filed prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.

t. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the owner of any building or structure eligible for any of the benefits of this section which is converted to a class A multiple dwelling, completed, or substantially rehabilitated on or after January one, nineteen hundred seventy-four, shall register the initial rent for each dwelling unit in such building or structure with the New York state division of housing and community renewal. After such registration, the rents of such dwelling units shall be fully subject to regulations under chapter four of title twenty-six of the code so long as the benefits of this section are in effect or for such longer period as may be provided by law.

u. Any tax exemption or tax abatement authorized pursuant to this section may be revoked retroactively by the commissioner of department of housing preservation and development or the department of finance of the city of New York at any time during the authorized term of such tax exemption or tax abatement if real estate taxes or water and sewer charges due to the city of New York remain unpaid for one year after the same are due and payable. In no event shall revocation be effective prior to the date such taxes or charges were first due and payable.

v. Where alterations, improvements, or conversions include or benefit that part of a building which is not occupied for dwelling purposes but is occupied by stores or otherwise used for commercial purposes or community facilities, the increase in assessed valuation and the cost of the alteration shall be apportioned so that the benefits of this title shall not be provided for alterations, improvements or conversions made for other than dwelling purposes.

w. If any provision of this section or its application to any person shall be held invalid, the remainder of this section and the applicability of its provisions to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

x. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no benefit pursuant to paragraph five of subdivision b of this section shall be granted for work commenced after January first, nineteen hundred eighty, unless the applicant establishes that the department of housing preservation and development and tenants of such class A multiple dwelling were given notice of (i) the proposed work prior to commencement of such work, (ii) the identity of the owner's representative, and (iii) the tenants' rights under applicable law with respect to such work, provided that, in the case of a loan program supervised by such department, notice to the department shall be unnecessary, and further provided that the department may itself provide the required notice to the tenants.

y. Applicants for benefits under the provisions of this section shall file with the department of finance a form supplied by said department which (i) states an intention to file for benefits under the provisions of this section, (ii) describes the work for which tax benefits will be claimed and (iii) estimates the cost of such work which will be eligible for benefits. Such form shall be filed prior to the commencement of such work. If the scope of such work or the estimated cost thereof changes materially, applicant shall file a revised statement. Applicants who fail to comply with the requirements of this subdivision shall be subject to a penalty not to exceed one hundred percent of the filing fee otherwise payable pursuant to subdivision n of this section.

z. A former tenant or former subtenant of premises in a nonresidential building which is the subject of an application for an alteration permit for conversion to a class A multiple dwelling, prior to the application for any tax exemption or abatement benefits for such building pursuant to this section, and as a condition to the grant thereof, shall be entitled to a relocation award under the terms and conditions set forth below:

   (1) As used in this subdivision, the term "eligible tenant" shall mean any former tenant or former subtenant who:

      (i) leased and used the vacated premises to conduct a manufacturing, warehousing, or wholesaling business for not less than two consecutive years immediately prior to vacating;

      (ii) vacated such premises on or after April first, nineteen hundred eighty-one for any reason other than eviction for non-payment of rent;

      (iii) vacated such premises (a) no earlier than twenty-four months prior to the filing date of an application for such alteration permit and (b) no later than the completion of the conversion as evidenced by the issuance of a permanent certificate of occupancy for a class A multiple dwelling;

      (iv) either purchased or leased for a term of not less than eighteen months other premises within the city of New York with a floor area not less than one-third of the floor area of the vacated premises;

      (v) relocated their business to such other premises within one year of vacating the vacated premises; and

      (vi) paid all commercial rent or occupancy tax for the vacated premises. A subtenant shall be eligible to receive a relocation award notwithstanding any lack of eligibility of its prime tenant;

   (2) the relocation award shall not exceed the greater of (i) the aggregate base rent which accrued and was paid by the eligible tenant during the final twenty-four months of its occupancy of the vacated premises or (ii) four dollars for each square foot that the eligible tenant occupied in the vacated premises during the final twenty-four months of its occupancy of the vacated premises. As used in this subdivision, base rent shall be calculated in the same manner as base rent is calculated for purposes of commercial rent or occupancy tax in the city of New York. However, the aggregate award payable to a prime tenant and/or any subtenants of such prime tenant shall not exceed the amount which would have been payable to the prime tenant had the prime tenant been eligible for an award based on the entire floor area it leased from the owner; and if such limitation applies, the awards shall be prorated based upon the total floor area used and occupied by each eligible tenant;

   (3) the relocation award shall become due and payable to an eligible tenant at the time the eligible tenant (i) either purchases or leases other premises in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision, and (ii) certifies eligibility to, and demands payment of, the award from the owner of the vacated building. If the relocation award is not paid within thirty days of such certification and demand, interest shall accrue on the relocation award from the date of the certification and demand at the rate of twenty-four percent per annum;

   (4) at any time after such certification and demand and prior to the date of the filing of an application for tax exemption or abatement for the vacated building pursuant to this section, an eligible tenant who has not received a relocation award shall have a right to file a notice of claim. Such notice of claim shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the vacated building is located and shall verify the claimant's name, its compliance with eligibility requirements, the address of the vacated premises, the floor area it occupied, the name of the prime tenant if the claimant is a subtenant, and all the base rent that accrued and was paid by the claimant during the final twenty-four months of its occupancy;

   (5) a notice of claim, filed in accordance with paragraph four of this subdivision, may be discharged by the filing of an undertaking with the clerk of the county in which the premises are located in an amount equal to the amount claimed and in accordance with the procedures set forth in subdivision four of section nineteen of the lien law, or by the payment into court of such amount in accordance with the procedures set forth in section fifty-five of such law;

   (6) no tax exemption or abatement shall be granted pursuant to this section unless the department of housing preservation and development receives an affidavit from the applicant for benefits of this section which verifies that:

      (i) the applicant has caused to be published a notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city of New York, no later than sixty days prior to filing of an application for tax exemption or abatement pursuant to this section, which advises former tenants and subtenants of their rights pursuant to this subdivision; and

      (ii) no notice of claim has been filed or all claims have been released by the claimants, or secured in accordance with the provisions of paragraph five of this subdivision, or discharged as an improper claim by court order;

   (7) the affidavit required pursuant to the provisions of paragraph six of this subdivision shall be considered part of the application for benefits pursuant to this section;

   (8) if an eligible tenant has duly filed a notice of claim pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision and did not receive a relocation award as provided herein, it may commence an action against any applicant who filed a false affidavit pursuant to paragraph six of this subdivision or any security posted by such applicant pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision, within three years of such filing. In any action to enforce a claim pursuant to this subdivision, if the court finds that the claimant has wilfully exaggerated the amount of the claim, the claimant may be held liable in damages for an amount not to exceed the proper relocation award. An eligible tenant in whose favor a judgment is entered shall be entitled to costs and reasonable legal fees and disbursements provided that such judgment is in excess of the amount which the applicant or owner offered to pay the eligible tenant;

   (9) any lease or other rental agreement provision exempting, waiving, releasing or discharging the obligation to pay a relocation award pursuant to this subdivision shall be void as against public policy and wholly unenforceable;

   (10) the provisions of this subdivision shall not apply south of fifty-ninth street in the county of New York if the zoning resolution of the city of New York expressly provides for relocation loans and/or grants in lieu of the benefits of this subdivision.

aa. Harassment.

   (1)    The provisions of this subdivision apply to and are additional requirements for claiming or receiving:

      (a) any tax exemption under this section; or

      (b) any tax abatement under this section where the certified reasonable cost per dwelling unit of the conversion, alteration or improvement (including the cost of any conversion, alteration or improvement for which an abatement was approved within four years prior to commencement of the conversion, alteration or improvement) exceeds seven thousand five hundred dollars.

   (2) The owner of the property shall file with the department of housing preservation and development, not less than thirty days before the commencement of the conversion, alteration or improvement (hereinafter referred to as the "cut-off date"), an affidavit, or, where any information referred to in paragraph one of this subdivision changes prior to applying for or claiming any benefit under this section, an amending affidavit, setting forth the following information:

      (a) every owner of record and owner of a substantial interest in the property or entity owning the property or sponsoring the conversion, alteration or improvement;

      (b) a statement that none of such persons had, within the five years prior to the cut-off date, been found to have harassed or unlawfully evicted tenants by judgment or determination of a court or agency (including a non-governmental agency having appropriate legal jurisdiction) under the penal law, any state or local law regulating rents or any state or local law relating to harassment of tenants or unlawful eviction; and

      (c) any change in the information required to be set forth.

   (3) No conversion, alteration or improvement subject to this subdivision shall be eligible for tax exemption or tax abatement under this section where:

      (a) any affidavit required under this subdivision has not been filed; or

Eligible real property shall not be eligible for an abatement under this section if the fraction calculated in subparagraph two of this paragraph is equal to or greater than one.

   e. Eligible real property shall not be eligible for an abatement under this section if the amount of the abatement calculated pursuant to this subdivision exceeds the annual tax on the property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen.

5. Recovery of erroneous abatement. 

   a. For purposes of this section, an "erroneous abatement" means that:

      (1) an abatement was granted to a property that was not entitled to an abatement under this section, or

      (2) an abatement was applied or calculated in error under this section. In such event, the amount of the erroneous abatement shall be equal to the difference between the amount of the abatement originally received and the amount to which the property was entitled.

   b. If the commissioner of finance determines that a property received an erroneous abatement, he or she shall recover such erroneous abatement by deducting the amount of the erroneous abatement from any refund or rebate otherwise payable to the owner, and any balance of the amount of the erroneous abatement remaining unpaid shall constitute a tax lien on the real property, as of the due and payable date provided on the next tax bill mailed by the commissioner of finance containing such amount. If such amount is not paid by such due and payable date, interest at the rate applicable to delinquent real property taxes on such property shall be charged and collected on such amount from the due and payable date provided on such notice to the date of payment. Such tax lien shall be enforceable in accordance with the provisions of law relating to the enforcement of tax liens in any such city.

6. Reduction of assessed value. If the taxable assessed value of a property for the fiscal year beginning on the first of July, two thousand fourteen is reduced after the assessment roll applicable to such fiscal year becomes final, any abatement already granted pursuant to this section shall be adjusted accordingly. The difference between the original abatement and the adjusted abatement shall be deducted from any credit otherwise due.

8. Any exemption provided by this section shall be computed after all partial exemptions allowed by law have been subtracted from the total amount assessed.

9. Exemption from taxation as provided in this section on real property owned by husband and wife, one of whom is sixty-five years of age or older, once granted, shall not be rescinded solely because of the death of the older spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at least sixty-two years of age.

10. a.    For the purposes of this section, title to that portion of real property owned by a cooperative apartment corporation in which a tenant-stockholder of such corporation resides and which is represented by his or her share or shares of stock in such corporation as determined by its or their proportional relationship to the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that owned by the corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenant-stockholder. That proportion of the assessment of real property owned by a cooperative apartment corporation, determined by the relationship of such real property vested in such tenant-stockholder to such entire parcel and the buildings thereon owned by such cooperative apartment corporation in which such tenant-stockholder resides, shall be subject to exemption from taxation pursuant to this section and any exemption so granted shall be credited by the department of finance against the assessed valuation of such real property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby shall be credited by the cooperative apartment corporation against the amount of such taxes otherwise payable by or chargeable to such tenant-stockholder. Each cooperative apartment corporation shall notify each tenant-stockholder in residence thereof of such provisions as are set forth in this section.

   b. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a tenant-stockholder who resides in a dwelling which is subject to the provisions of either article II, IV, V or XI of the private housing finance law and who is eligible for a rent increase exemption pursuant to chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code shall not be eligible for an exemption pursuant to this subdivision. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a tenant-stockholder who resides in a dwelling which is subject to the provisions of either article II, IV, V or XI of the private housing finance law and who is not eligible for a rent increase exemption pursuant to chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code but who meets the requirements for eligibility for an exemption pursuant to this section shall be eligible for such exemption provided that such exemption shall be in an amount determined by multiplying the exemption otherwise allowable pursuant to this section by a fraction having a numerator equal to the amount of real property taxes or payments in lieu of taxes that were paid with respect to such dwelling and a denominator equal to the full amount of real property taxes that would have been owed with respect to such dwelling had it not been granted an exemption or abatement of real property taxes pursuant to any provision of law, provided, however, that any reduction in real property taxes received with respect to such dwelling pursuant to chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code or pursuant to this section shall not be considered in calculating such numerator. Any tenant-stockholder who resides in a dwelling which was or continues to be subject to a mortgage insured or initially insured by the federal government pursuant to section two hundred thirteen of the national housing act, as amended, and who is eligible for both a rent increase exemption pursuant to chapter seven of title twenty-six of this code and an exemption pursuant to this subdivision, may apply for and receive either a rent increase exemption pursuant to such chapter or an exemption pursuant to this subdivision, but not both.

11. Exemption Option. Notwithstanding any provision of this part to the contrary, real property owned by one or more persons where one of such owners qualifies for a real property tax exemption pursuant to this section or section 11-245.4 of this part, and another of such owners qualifies for a different tax exemption pursuant to such sections of this part as authorized by state law, such owners shall have the option of choosing the one exemption which is most beneficial to such owners. Such owners shall not be prohibited from taking one such exemption solely on the basis that such owners qualify for more than one exemption and therefore are not eligible for any exemptions.








*§ 11-245.4 Exemption for persons with disabilities.* ::


1. (a)    Real property owned by one or more persons with disabilities, or real property owned by a husband, wife, or both, or by siblings, at least one of whom has a disability, or real property owned by one or more persons, some of whom qualify under this section and section 11-245.3 of this part, and whose income, as hereafter defined, is limited by reason of such disability, shall be exempt from taxes on real estate to the extent of fifty per centum of the assessed valuation thereof as hereinafter provided. For purposes of this section, sibling shall mean a brother or a sister, whether related through half blood, whole blood or adoption.

   (b) For purposes of this section, a person with a disability is one who has a physical or mental impairment, not due to current use of alcohol or illegal drug use, which substantially limits such person's ability to engage in one or more major life activities, such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning and working, and who (i) is certified to receive social security disability insurance (SSDI) or supplemental security income (SSI) benefits under the federal social security act, or (ii) is certified to receive railroad retirement disability benefits under the federal railroad retirement act, or (iii) has received a certificate from the state commission for the blind and visually handicapped stating that such person is legally blind, or (iv) is certified to receive a United States postal service disability pension. An award letter from the social security administration or the railroad retirement board or a certificate from the state commission for the blind and visually handicapped or an award letter from the United States postal service shall be submitted as proof of disability.

2. Exemption from taxation for school purposes shall not be granted in the case of real property where a child resides if such child attends a public school of elementary or secondary education.

3. No exemption shall be granted:

   (a) if the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making application for exemption exceeds the sum of twenty-six thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand six, twenty-seven thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seven, twenty-eight thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand eight, twenty-nine thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand nine, and fifty thousand dollars beginning July first, two thousand seventeen. Income tax year shall mean the twelve month period for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal income tax return, or if no such return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the husband or the wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum, except where the husband or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife is absent from the property due to divorce, legal separation or abandonment, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on the property shall be considered and may not exceed such sum. Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings, and net income from self-employment, but shall not include a return of capital, gifts, inheritances or monies earned through employment in the federal foster grandparent program and any such income shall be offset by all medical and prescription drug expenses actually paid which were not reimbursed or paid for by insurance. In computing net rental income and net income from self-employment no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property held for the production of income;

   (b) unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes, provided, however, that in the event any portion of such property is not so used exclusively for residential purposes but is used for other purposes, such portion shall be subject to taxation and the remaining portion only shall be entitled to the exemption provided by this section;

   (c) unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in whole or in part by the disabled person; except where the disabled person is absent from the residence while receiving health-related care as an inpatient of a residential health care facility, as defined in section twenty-eight hundred one of the public health law, provided that any income accruing to that person shall be considered income for purposes of this section only to the extent that it exceeds the amount paid by such person or spouse or sibling of such person for care in the facility.

4. Application for such exemption must be made annually by the owner, or all of the owners of the property, on forms prescribed by the state board, and shall be filed with the department of finance on or before the fifteenth day of March of the appropriate year; provided, however, proof of a permanent disability need be submitted only in the year exemption pursuant to this section is first sought or the disability is first determined to be permanent.

5. At least sixty days prior to the fifteenth day of March of the appropriate year, the department of finance shall mail to each person who was granted exemption pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or before the fifteenth day of March and be approved in order for the exemption to continue to be granted. Failure to mail such application form or the failure of such person to receive the same shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property owned by such person.

6. Notwithstanding the maximum income exemption eligibility level provided in subdivision three of this section, an exemption, subject to all other provisions of this section, shall be granted as indicated in the following schedule:

10. Exemption Option. Notwithstanding any provision of this part to the contrary, real property owned by one or more persons where one of such owners qualifies for a real property tax exemption pursuant to this section or section 11-245.3 of this part, and another of such owners qualifies for a different tax exemption pursuant to such sections of this part as authorized by state law, such owners shall have the option of choosing the one exemption which is most beneficial to such owners.

*§ 11-245.9 Alternative exemption for veterans; transfer of title.* ::


1. Pursuant to subdivision eight of section four hundred fifty-eight-a of the real property tax law, where a veteran, the spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse already receiving an exemption pursuant to such section sells the property receiving such exemption and purchases property within the city, the department of finance shall transfer and prorate, for the remainder of the fiscal year, the exemption received. The prorated exemption shall be based upon the date the veteran, the spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse obtains title to the new property and shall be calculated by multiplying the tax rate for which taxes were levied, on the appropriate tax roll used for the fiscal year during which the transfer occurred, multiplied by the previously granted exempt amount, multiplied by the fraction of each fiscal year remaining subsequent to the transfer of title.

2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove the requirement that any such veteran, the spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse transferring an exemption pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall reapply for the exemption authorized pursuant to section four hundred fifty-eight-a of the real property tax law on or before the following taxable status date, in the event such veteran, the spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse wishes to receive the exemption in future fiscal years.

c. In all cases where the board shall have issued a certificate of eligibility prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, the exemption percentage shall apply to any subsequent increase in the assessed valuation of the property during the tenure of the exemption. Where the board has issued a certificate of eligibility on or after January first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, the exemption percentage shall apply to any subsequent increase in the assessed valuation of the property during the first two years after approval of the tax exemption pursuant to section 11-252 of this part.

d.

The provisions of this part shall apply exclusively to those structures and the lands underlying them which were identified explicitly in the certificate of eligibility.

e. The provisions of this part shall not apply if any new or rehabilitated construction displaces or replaces a building or buildings containing more than twenty-five occupied dwelling units in existence on the date an application for certificate of eligibility is submitted for preliminary approval pursuant to section 11-251 of this part, which are administered under the local emergency housing rent control act, the rent stabilization law of nineteen hundred sixty-nine or the emergency tenant protection act of nineteen seventy-four, unless a certificate of eviction has been issued for any of the displaced or replaced units pursuant to the powers granted by the city rent and rehabilitation law.

Upon a finding by such office that the application satisfies the requirements of reconstruction or construction as defined in this part, the application shall be presented to the board for evaluation and written notice thereof shall be given to the community board of the district in which the application site is located.

b. (1) In the case of an application for construction or reconstruction of an industrial structure or a commercial structure located in an area designated as of right, the board shall issue a certificate of eligibility upon determining that the application satisfies the requirements of construction or reconstruction as defined in this part, that the applicant has obtained plans for construction or reconstruction certified by a professional engineer or architect, and that the applicant has otherwise complied with the provisions of this part and other applicable provisions of law.

   (2) In the case of an application for construction or reconstruction of a commercial structure not located in an as of right area, or involving a restricted commercial use, the board shall issue a certificate of eligibility upon making the determination specified in paragraph one of this subdivision and upon making the further determination that the granting of a tax exemption for the construction or reconstruction of such a structure in the proposed location is in the public interest. In making such determination, the board shall make findings that there is a need in the area for the services the enterprise will provide, that the enterprise will generate or retain employment in the area, and that a tax incentive is required to attract construction or reconstruction of such a structure to the area. In addition, the board shall consider the economic impact such commercial structure will have in the area.

   (3) In the case of an application for construction or reconstruction of a commercial structure not located in an as of right area, or involving a restricted commercial use, the board may make a further determination that special circumstances warrant designating the proposed construction or reconstruction as "specially needed". In making such determination, the board shall make findings that the commercial services to be provided will have an especially positive impact on the area's or the city's economy and that the applicant has demonstrated that the project cannot go forward without the greater exemption granted by such designation.

The tax exemption approved by the board shall continue in accordance with this part, provided that the applicant files an annual certificate of continuing use stating that the structure and property continue to be used for the industrial or commercial purposes justifying the issuance of the certificate of eligibility. The certificate of continuing use shall be filed with the tax commission on such form or forms and containing such information as shall be prescribed by the tax commission. The tax commission shall have authority to terminate a tax exemption on failure of an applicant to file an annual certificate of continuing use or on the recommendation of the commissioner of finance who, in reviewing the certificate filed by an applicant, has determined that the structure or property has ceased to be used for the industrial or commercial purposes justifying the issuance of the certificate of eligibility.






*§ 11-254 Extension of time for completion.* ::


Where an applicant has received a certificate of eligibility but has not completed or will not be able to complete the construction or reconstruction work within thirty-six months, the board shall, upon application, extend to forty-eight months, from the time of issuance of such certificate, the time for completion of the construction or reconstruction work; provided the applicant has completed not less than two-thirds of the work as specified in the certified plans previously filed with the application at the time of such application for extension.

      (b) If, due to a determination of the department of finance or tax commission of such city or a court, the real property tax imposed on such property for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility is changed, then any abatement that was granted in accordance with this paragraph prior to such reduction shall be recalculated and any abatement to be granted in accordance with this paragraph shall be based on the real property tax imposed on such property for the tax year immediately preceding the effective date of such certificate of eligibility, as changed by such determination.

If the original finding of violation or the denial of certification is appealed and a court or appropriate governmental agency finally determines that the finding of violation or denial of certification was invalid, any benefits lost pursuant to this section to which the recipient was entitled shall be restored retroactively. As applied to a recipient who is eligible for deferral of tax payments pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-257 of this part, suspension of benefits shall be deferred by operation of such section and interest at the rate charged by the department of finance for overdue taxes shall be charged on the amount of any tax payments already deferred by operation of such section.

A co-applicant with a public entity may be eligible for abatement benefits, provided that for any period for which the property is exempt from real property tax because it is owned or controlled by a public entity, no benefits shall be available to such recipient under this part. Such recipient may receive benefits under this part when the property is no longer eligible for an exemption as follows:

   (1) No benefits under this part shall be provided during the period of exemption;

For the duration of the benefit period, the recipient of benefits shall file biennially with the department, on or before the appropriate taxable status date, a statement of the continuing use of such property and any changes in use that have occurred, provided, however, that any recipient of benefits receiving benefits for property defined as a peaking unit shall file such statement biannually. This statement shall be in a form determined by the department and may be in any format the department determines, in its discretion, is appropriate, including electronic format. The department shall have authority to terminate such benefits upon failure of a recipient to file such statement by the appropriate taxable status date. The burden of proof shall be on the recipient to establish continuing eligibility for benefits and the department shall have the authority to require that statements filed under this subdivision be certified.

b.    Conversion of construction. A recipient shall file an amendment to the latest statement of continuing use prior to:

   (1) converting square footage within property that is the subject of benefits for industrial construction work from use for the manufacturing activities described in such statement of continuing use where such conversion would result in less than sixty-five percent of total net square footage being used or held out for use for manufacturing activities; or

   (2) converting any portion of property that is the subject of benefits for industrial construction work for use for any restricted activity or as residential property.

   (3) For all other use conversions, applicants shall immediately notify the department of a change in use, in a manner that the department may determine.

b. Conversion from industrial use to commercial use. Where a property has been granted benefits for industrial construction work, and where, before the benefit period expires, less than seventy-five percent of the total net square footage is used or held out for use for manufacturing activities, no further benefits for industrial construction work shall be provided except as provided in this subdivision. Taxes, together with interest, shall become due and owing after such date of the use for purposes other than industrial, except as provided in this subdivision.

   (1) Any applicant whose property has been granted a tax abatement under this part for industrial construction work in a special commercial abatement area who would have been eligible to receive benefits for commercial construction work at the time such applicant applied for benefits shall continue to receive an abatement for industrial construction work.

   (2) Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits under this part for industrial construction work other than in a special commercial abatement area who would have been eligible to receive benefits for commercial construction work at the time such applicant applied for benefits shall, commencing with the date of conversion to commercial property and continuing until the expiration of the benefit period for commercial construction work, receive any abatement which such applicant would have received in the corresponding tax year pursuant to the benefits granted for commercial construction work.

   (3) Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits under this part for industrial construction work in any area of the city on whose property at least sixty-five percent of the net square footage continues to be used or held out for use for manufacturing activities after conversion to commercial property, shall not be required to pay the pro rata share of tax for which an abatement was claimed during the tax year in which such conversion occurred.

   (4) Where the property is receiving the additional industrial abatement pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision c of section 11-269 of this part, such additional industrial abatement shall cease from the date of conversion to commercial property.

c. Conversion to restricted use. Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits for commercial, industrial or renovation construction work, and who uses such property for any restricted activity prior to the expiration of the benefit period, shall cease to be eligible for further abatement as of the date such property was first used for any restricted activity. Such recipient of benefits that cease under this subdivision shall pay with interest any taxes for which an abatement was claimed after such date, including the pro rata share of tax for which any abatement was claimed during the tax year in which such use occurred.

d. Conversion to residential use.

   (1) Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits for commercial, industrial or renovation construction work and who, before the benefit period expires, uses the property or a portion of the property as residential property, shall cease to be eligible for further abatement for commercial, industrial or renovation construction work as of the date such property was first used as residential property, as follows:

      (a) if twenty percent or more of the rentable square footage of the property is used as residential property, then the entire building shall cease to be eligible for further abatement;

      (b) if less than twenty percent of the rentable square footage of the property is used as residential property, then that portion of such property used as residential property shall cease to be eligible for further abatement;

      (c) notwithstanding subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, where less than five percent of a property's rentable square footage is used as residential property, that use will be considered de minimums and will not be a basis for benefits to cease under this subdivision; and

      (d) such recipient of benefits that cease under this subdivision shall pay, with interest, any taxes for which an abatement was claimed after the conversion of the property as described in this subdivision, including the pro rata share of tax for which such abatement was claimed during the tax year in which such use occurred. The abatement shall continue for the commercial, industrial or renovation construction work for the portion of the property that continues to be used for commercial purposes.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, "property" means the real property contained by an individual tax lot.

   (3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subdivision, where a building or structure is owned in condominium form, and an application for benefits under this part includes more than one property in the same condominium, then for purposes of this subdivision, the five percent and twenty percent of the rentable square footage shall be determined based on the aggregate usage of all such properties.

e. Conversion to retail use.

   (1) Where a property has been granted benefits for industrial or commercial construction work in special commercial abatement areas on buildings where not more than ten percent of the building or structure is used for retail purposes and where, before the benefit period expires, the property or a portion thereof is converted so that ten percent or more of the building or structure is used for retail purposes, the department shall recalculate the abatement upon conversion as provided in subdivision six of this section.

   (2) Where a property has been granted benefits for renovation construction work in renovation areas and where, before the benefit period expires, the property or a portion of the property is converted so that more than five percent of the building or structure is used for retail purposes, the department shall recalculate the abatement upon conversion as provided in subdivision f of this section.

e-1. Conversion of use by peaking units. Any applicant whose property has been granted benefits under this part for industrial construction work as a peaking unit and who converts such property in any tax year to a use that no longer qualifies it as a peaking unit, or who uses such property in a manner inconsistent with the definition of a peaking unit, shall be ineligible for abatement benefits during any such tax year. Any such recipient of benefits shall pay with interest taxes for which an abatement was claimed during any portion of such tax year.

f. Recalculation of abatement upon conversion. If, during the benefit period, a recipient converts square footage within any building or structure, the department may recalculate the benefit granted pursuant to this part to reflect the benefit for which the current use is eligible under this part and rules that may be promulgated by the department.

g. The burden shall at all times be on the recipient to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that property subject to benefits under this part is used as stated in the preliminary and applications for benefits filed by the recipient with the department.

Each member except the public member shall have the power to designate an alternate to represent him or her at commission meetings to exercise all the rights and powers of such member, including the right to vote, provided that such designation be made in writing to the chair of the commission. The deputy mayor designated by the mayor shall serve as commission chair. Each borough president shall be entitled to vote only on the designation of areas within his or her borough. Commission members who shall be officers or employees of such city shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses necessarily incurred in the performance of their duties. Any other commission member shall receive as exclusive compensation for his or her services one hundred dollars per diem, or another reasonable amount as determined by the deputy mayor designated by the mayor, provided, however, that the total compensation paid to any such member shall not exceed twelve hundred dollars for any calendar year, or another reasonable amount determined by the deputy mayor designated by the mayor. A majority of members of such commission entitled to vote on a matter shall constitute a quorum for such issue. Decisions shall be made by majority vote of those present entitled to vote on a matter. Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, no officer or employee of the state or any of its subdivisions or any public benefit corporation shall be deemed to have forfeited his or her office or employment or any benefits provided under the retirement and social security law or under any public retirement system maintained by the state or any of its subdivisions by reason of accepting membership on such commission.

b. Designation of special commercial abatement areas. 

   (1) The commission shall meet in two thousand nine or two thousand fifteen and at least once every five years thereafter to determine the boundaries of special commercial abatement areas which it is authorized, but not required, to designate pursuant to this section. The areas designated by the commission established pursuant to title two-D of article four of the real property tax law in effect as of June thirtieth, two thousand eight shall remain in effect until the first taxable status date after the city council approves a new designation pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision or, if the local legislative body does not approve a new designation before January first, two thousand sixteen, then, for purposes of applications for special commercial abatement area benefits, the areas designated by the commission established pursuant to title two-D of article four of the real property tax law in effect as of June thirtieth, two thousand eight shall remain in effect until December thirty-first, two thousand fifteen.

   (2) In years when special commercial abatement areas are to be designated, no later than October first, the commission shall provide public notice of such designation by publishing a notice at least once in a newspaper of general circulation setting forth the proposed boundaries. Notice may also be provided electronically or in an electronic medium, such as a website, in a manner the commission determines to be appropriate. Notice must be provided not earlier than five nor later than fifteen days before the date of the commission's public hearing to hear all persons interested in the designation of the areas. The notice required by this paragraph shall be published in the City Record and a newspaper of general circulation in the city, and copies thereof shall be forwarded to each council member and community board.

   (3) The commission shall make such designation, and notify the city council of such designation, not later than November first of each year when special commercial abatement areas are to be designated.

   (4) Within thirty days after the first stated meeting of the city council following the receipt of notice of such designation, the city council may, by majority vote, disapprove such designation. If, within such thirty-day period, the city council fails to act or fails to act by the required vote, the city council shall be deemed to have approved such designation. Such designation shall take effect on the first taxable status date after the city council approves such designation and shall remain in effect until the first taxable status date after the city council approves such new designation.

   (5) The commission may designate any area other than the area lying south of the center line of 96th Street in the borough of Manhattan, to be a special commercial abatement area if it determines that market conditions in the area are such that the availability of a special abatement is required in order to encourage commercial construction work in such area. In making such determination, the commission shall consider, among other factors, the existence in such area of a special need for commercial and job development, high unemployment, economic distress or unusually large numbers of vacant, underutilized, unsuitable or substandard structures, or other substandard, unsanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, with or without tangible blight.

   (6) If the commission fails to meet in two thousand fifteen, all new applications for special commercial abatement area benefits postmarked after December thirty-first, two thousand fifteen shall be deemed applications for regular area benefits.

It shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance to give public notice, by advertisement, for at least ten days, in the City Record and as soon as practicable and within ten days after the confirmation of any assessment, that the same has been confirmed, specifying the title of such assessment, and the date of its confirmation, and also the date of entry in the record of titles of assessments kept in the department of finance, addressed as a class to all persons, owners of property affected by any such assessment, that unless the amount assessed for benefit on any person or property shall be paid within ninety days after the date of the entry of any such assessment, interest shall be thereafter collected thereon as provided in section 11-306 of this chapter.






*§ 11-306 Interest to be charged if assessments unpaid for ninety days; payment in installments.* ::


If any assessment shall remain unpaid for the period of ninety days after the date of the entry thereof on the record of titles of assessments, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to charge, collect and receive interest thereon, at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date when such assessment became a lien as provided by section three hundred fourteen of the charter in force at the time of the adoption of the New York city charter by referendum in the year nineteen hundred sixty-one, provided, however, that the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall accept and credit as payments on account of assessments now or hereafter levied against any parcel or plot of property, such sums of money not less than twenty-five dollars or multiples thereof in amount as may be tendered for payment on account of any assessment now or hereafter levied against any property. Upon requisition by the commissioner of finance for the assessed valuation of the property affected by any assessment, the president of the tax commission, or any tax commissioner duly assigned by him or her, shall forthwith certify the same to the commissioner of finance.






*§ 11-307 Payments in installments of assessments heretofore or hereafter confirmed.* ::


Upon the application in writing of the owner of a parcel of real property affected by an unpaid assessment heretofore or hereafter confirmed the amount of which is one hundred dollars or more, the commissioner of finance shall divide the assessment upon such parcel into fifteen parts or, if the application so requests, into five parts, as nearly equal as may be, or if the amount of such assessment is fifty dollars or more but less than one hundred dollars the commissioner of finance shall divide the assessment upon such parcel into five parts as nearly equal as may be. One part thereof in any event shall be due and payable, and in each case as many more of such parts shall be due and payable as years may have elapsed since the entry of such original assessment for collection. Such parts thereof with interest at the rate of seven percent per annum on the amount of the assessment unpaid shall be paid at the time of application as a condition of the extension of time of payment of the remainder as provided in this section. Upon payment of such parts and interests, the balance of such assessments shall cease to be a lien upon such real property except as hereinafter provided; and the remaining parts shall be paid in annual installments as herein provided. Of such installments the first, with interest at the rate of four percent thereon, and on the installments thereafter to become due, from the date of payment of the parts of such assessment paid as hereinbefore provided, shall become due and payable and be a lien on the real property assessed, on the next ensuing anniversary of the date of entry of the assessment in the record of titles of assessments confirmed; and one, with interest at the rate of four percent per annum thereon and on the installments thereafter to become due shall become due and payable and be a lien upon the real property assessed, annually thereafter. After the time herein specified for annual installments and interest to become due, the amount of the lien thereon shall bear interest at the rate of seven percent per annum. Any installment assessment shall not be further divided into installments. The first installment of an assessment divided within the ninety-day period provided by section 11-306 of this chapter during which assessment may be paid without interest shall not be subject to interest, but the second installment with interest at the rate of four percent per annum from the original date of entry shall become due and payable and be a lien upon the real property on the anniversary date of entry of the assessment and the remaining installments with interest shall become due and payable and be a lien on the real property as hereinbefore provided. The installments not due with interest at the rate of four percent per annum to the date of payment may be paid at any time. The provisions of this chapter with reference to the sale of tax liens shall apply to the several unpaid installments and the interest thereon in the same manner as if each installment and the interest thereon had been imposed as an assessment payable in one payment, at the time such installment became a lien. In the event of the acquisition by condemnation by the city for public purposes any property upon which there are installments not due, such installments shall become due as of the date of the entry of the final order of the supreme court or the confirmation of the report of the commissioners in the condemnation proceedings, and shall be set off against an award that may be made for the property acquired. When an award for damage shall accrue to the same person who is or was at the time the assessment was confirmed liable for the assessments for benefit on the abutting property in the same proceedings, only the portion of the assessment in excess of such award may be considered in levying in installments under the provisions of this section. Except as provided in this section, no such annual installment shall be a lien or deemed to be an encumbrance upon the title to the real property assessed until it becomes due as herein provided.

b. The commissioner of finance, on behalf of the city, may sell tax liens, either individually, in combinations, or in the aggregate, pursuant to the procedures provided herein. The commissioner of finance shall establish the terms and conditions of a sale of a tax lien or tax liens. Enactment of the local law that added this sentence shall be deemed to constitute authorization by the council for the commissioner of finance to conduct a sale or sales of tax liens through and including December thirty-first, two thousand twenty. Subsequent to December thirty-first, two thousand twenty, the city shall not have the authority to sell tax liens.

   1. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale. In addition to the advertisement and notice required to be provided pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax lien or tax liens through a competitive sale, which notice shall include the terms and conditions for such sale, the criteria by which bids shall be evaluated, and a request for any other information or documents that the commissioner of finance may require. Such notice shall be published in one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than fifteen days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the submission of bids.

      (ii) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, establish criteria for the eligibility of bidders pursuant to section 11-321.1 of this chapter.

      (iii) The commissioner of finance may reject any or all bids, or may accept any combination of bids in a competitive sale.

   2. (i) The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, sell a tax lien or tax liens through a negotiated sale. In addition to the advertisement and notice required to be provided pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall cause to be published a notice of intention to sell a tax lien or tax liens through a negotiated sale, which notice shall advise that a request for statements of interest is available at the office of the department of finance, and which may require the submission of any information or documents that the commissioner deems appropriate, provided, however, that if the negotiated sale is to a trust or other entity created by the city or in which the city has an ownership or residual interest, then the requirement that the notice advise that a request for statements of interest is available at the office of the department of finance shall not apply. Such notice shall be published in one newspaper of general circulation in the city, not less than fifteen days prior to the date designated by the commissioner for the receipt of statements of interest, or if the negotiated sale is to such trust or other entity, then such notice shall be published not less than fifteen days prior to the date of sale. For purposes of this subparagraph, the words "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in subdivision e of section 11-320 of this chapter.

      (ii) The commissioner of finance may engage in a negotiated sale in accordance with criteria to be established pursuant to section 11-321.1 of this chapter.

      (iii) The commissioner of finance may execute a purchase and sale agreement and other necessary agreements with a designated purchaser or purchasers to complete a negotiated sale.

   3. The commissioner of finance may establish a minimum price for the sale of tax liens that may be at a discount from or premium to the lien amount. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the commissioner of finance may not establish a minimum price for the sale of an individual tax lien that is at a discount from the lien amount. The commissioner of finance shall sell such tax liens at a purchase price that, in the determination of such commissioner, is in the best interests of the city. The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may accept cash or cash equivalent in immediately available funds, or other consideration acceptable to the commissioner, or any combination thereof in payment for a tax lien or tax liens.

   4. The amount of a tax lien that is sold pursuant to this chapter shall be the unpaid amount of the lien as of the date of sale, including any interest and penalties thereon, any taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, any surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon, or such component of the amount thereof as shall be determined by the commissioner of finance, notwithstanding the amount paid for purchase of the tax lien or component of the amount thereof. For purposes of this paragraph, the words, "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter.

   5. (i) The commissioner of finance may, subsequent to the offer for sale of any tax lien or tax liens and the failure to complete such sale, offer such tax lien or tax liens for sale again to any other person or persons who satisfied the terms and conditions of the sale without providing any additional advertisements or notices pursuant to this chapter.

      (ii) Notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, any tax lien that was noticed for sale pursuant to this chapter, but was not sold on the original date of sale, may be sold without any additional advertisements or notices pursuant to this chapter if the subsequent date of sale is within six months of the second publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of the original date of sale. If the subsequent date of sale is more than six months after the second publication, pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-320 of this chapter, of the notice of the original date of sale, then the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall provide notice of the subsequent date of sale pursuant to subdivision b of section 11-320 of this chapter. No other additional advertisements or notices shall be necessary prior to the date of sale.

   6. The rate of interest on any tax lien certificate shall be the rate adopted for nonpayment of taxes on real property, pursuant to subdivision (e) of section 11-224.1, that is in effect on January first of the year in which the tax lien is sold.

   7. It is the intent of the city that a sale of a tax lien or tax liens pursuant to this chapter shall be a sale and not a borrowing.

   8. Whenever any tax lien purchased at a tax lien sale is found to be invalid, void or defective in whole or in part, or not to conform to any representation or warranty with respect thereto, made by the commissioner of finance in connection with the sale thereof, by judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction or by determination of the commissioner of finance, the commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, substitute for such tax lien or portion thereof another tax lien that has a value equivalent to the value of the tax lien or portion thereof found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, or may refund such value of the tax lien or portion thereof found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, or may use a combination of substitution and refund. No other remedy shall be available to a purchaser of a tax lien which is found to be invalid, void, defective, or not to conform to a representation or warranty with respect thereto made by the commissioner of finance in connection with the sale thereof, in whole or in part. Whenever a tax lien of such equivalent value is to be substituted for a tax lien that has been found invalid, void, defective, or not to so conform, in whole or in part, pursuant to this section, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall provide mailed notice of the intention to substitute such lien of such equivalent value to any person required to be notified pursuant to section 11-320(b) of this chapter.

   9. The commissioner of finance may establish requirements for a purchaser of a tax lien to provide any information and documents that the commissioner of finance deems necessary, including information concerning the collection and enforcement of tax liens. The commissioner of finance shall require the purchaser of a tax lien to provide the owner of property on which a tax lien has been sold pursuant to this chapter a detailed itemization of taxes, interest, surcharges, and fees charged to such owner on all tax lien statements of amounts due or bill of charges. Such fees shall be bona fide, reasonable and, in the case of attorney fees, customary.

   10. (i) On and after January first, two thousand twelve, no tax lien shall be sold pursuant to this chapter on any class two residential property owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any such tax lien is sold in error pursuant to this chapter on and after January first, two thousand twelve on such property, then the provisions of paragraph eight of this subdivision shall apply to such sale, including the authority of the commissioner of finance to substitute for such tax lien another tax lien that has a value equivalent to the value of such tax lien or to refund the value of such tax lien. For the purposes of this paragraph, property owned by such company shall be limited to property owned for the purpose, as set forth in section five hundred seventy-one of the state private housing finance law, of providing housing for families and persons of low income.

      (ii) No later than May first, two thousand eleven, the commissioner of finance, in consultation with the commissioner of housing preservation and development, shall notify by mail any class two residential property owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law that is not a residential condominium or residential cooperative, of the authority of the commissioner of finance to sell the tax liens on such property. Such notification shall include information relating to the lien sale process, including, but not limited to, actions homeowners can take if a lien is sold on such property; the type of debt that can be sold in a lien sale; a timeline of statutory notifications required pursuant to section 11-320 of this chapter; a clear, concise explanation of the consequences of the sale of a tax lien; the telephone number and electronic mail address of the employee or employees designated pursuant to subdivision f of section 11-320 of this chapter; a conspicuous statement that the owner of the property may enter into a payment plan for exclusion from the tax lien sale; and credits and property tax exemptions that may exclude a property from a tax lien sale and any other credit or residential real property tax exemption information, which, in the discretion of the commissioner, should be included in such notification. Upon such property owner's written request, or verbal request to 311 or any employee designated pursuant to subdivision f of section 11-320 of this chapter, a Chinese, Korean, Russian or Spanish translation of such notice shall be provided promptly to such property owner.

   11. No later than September first, two thousand eleven, the appropriate agency shall promulgate rules identifying or describing any existing procedures governing challenges to the validity of any real property tax, sewer rent, sewer surcharge, water rent, emergency repair charge or alternative enforcement expense or fee.

   12. On or after January first, two thousand fifteen and before January first, two thousand seventeen, no tax lien shall be sold pursuant to this chapter on the following properties: (i) properties enrolled in the city's Build It Back Program; and (ii) properties defined as "eligible real property" pursuant to subdivision three of section four hundred sixty-seven-g of the real property tax law. If, notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any such tax lien is sold in error pursuant to this chapter during such time period on properties described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, then the provisions of paragraph eight of this subdivision shall apply to such sale, including the authority of the commissioner of finance to substitute for such tax lien another tax lien that has a value equivalent to the value of such tax lien or to refund the value of such lien.

   13. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, no tax lien shall be sold pursuant to this chapter on any of the following properties: (i) any real property for which the owner in good faith has submitted an application that is pending with the department of finance for a real property tax exemption pursuant to section four hundred twenty-a, four hundred twenty-b, four hundred forty-six, or four hundred sixty-two of the real property tax law; and (ii) any real property for which the owner has in good faith filed an appeal with the tax commission of a denial of any such application and such appeal is pending. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an application or an appeal referenced in the preceding sentence was not submitted in good faith where, within the 24 months preceding the submission of such application or such appeal, the period for the filing of an appeal of a denial by the department of finance of a previous application for a real property tax exemption pursuant to section four hundred twenty-a, four hundred twenty-b, four hundred forty-six, or four hundred sixty-two of the real property tax law has expired.

The commissioner of finance shall file such list in the office of the city register and the office of the county clerk of Richmond county not less than ninety days prior to the date of sale.

   2. Not less than ninety days preceding the date of the sale, the commissioner of finance shall post online, to the extent such information is available, the borough, block and lot of any property on which a lien has been or will be noticed for sale in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision and that, in one or more of the five fiscal years preceding the date of the sale, was in receipt of a real property tax exemption pursuant to section four hundred twenty-a, four hundred twenty-b, four hundred forty-six or four hundred sixty-two of the real property tax law and, in addition, shall post online, to the extent such information is available, the borough, block and lot of any vacant land classified as class one or class four pursuant to section eighteen hundred two of the real property tax law on which a lien has been or will be noticed for sale in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision. Any failure to comply with this paragraph shall not affect the validity of any sale of tax liens pursuant to this chapter.

b. 1. A tax lien shall not be sold unless the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, notifies the owner of record at the address of record and any other person who has registered pursuant to section 11-309 of this chapter, or pursuant to section 11-416 or 11-417 of this title, by first class mail, of the intention to sell the tax lien. If no such registrations have been filed then such commissioner, or his or her designee, shall notify the person whose name and address, if any, appears in the latest annual record of assessed valuations, by first class mail, of the intention to sell the tax lien. Such mailed notice shall include a description of the property by block and lot and such other identifying information as the commissioner of finance may deem appropriate, the amount of the tax lien, including all taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, as well as an estimate of the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable on the date specified in such publication, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter if the tax lien is sold, and interest and penalties thereon, and shall be mailed to such owner and such other persons four times: not less than ninety, sixty, thirty and ten days prior to the date of sale. Such notice shall state that if default continues to be made in payment of the amounts due on such property, the tax lien on such property shall be sold as provided in section 11-319 of this chapter. If, notwithstanding such notice, the owner shall continue to refuse or neglect to pay the amounts due on such property, the commissioner of finance may sell the tax lien on such property as provided in section 11-319 of this chapter.

   2. (i) Such notices shall also include, with respect to any property owner in class one or class two, as such classes of property are defined in subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of the real property tax law, an exemption eligibility checklist. The exemption eligibility checklist shall also be posted on the website of the department no later than the first business day after March fifteenth of every year prior to the date of sale, and shall continue to be posted on such website until ten days prior to the date of sale. Within ten business days of receipt of a completed exemption eligibility checklist from such property owner, provided that such receipt occurs prior to the date of sale of any tax lien or tax liens on his or her property, the department of finance shall review such checklist to determine, based on the information provided by the property owner, whether such property owner could be eligible for any exemption, credit or other benefit that would entitle them to be excluded from a tax lien sale and, if the department determines that such property owner could be eligible for any such exemption, credit or other benefit, shall mail such property owner an application for the appropriate exemption, credit or other benefit. If, within twenty business days of the date the department mailed such application, the department has not received a completed application from such property owner, the department shall mail such property owner a second application, and shall telephone the property owner, if the property owner has included his or her telephone number on the exemption eligibility checklist.

      (ii) Any such property owner who returns to the department of finance a completed exemption eligibility checklist prior to the date of sale of any tax lien or tax liens on his or her property and who subsequently submits a completed application for the appropriate exemption, credit or other benefit either prior to, on or up to ninety days after such sale, shall have his or her application reviewed by the department of finance. If, prior to the date of sale, the department of finance determines that such property owner is qualified for such exemption, credit or other benefit or will be qualified as of the date of sale, then the tax lien or tax liens on his or her property shall not be sold on such date. If, on or after the date of sale, the department of finance determines that such property owner is or was qualified for such exemption, credit or other benefit as of the date of sale, then any tax lien or tax liens on his or her property that were sold shall be deemed defective.

      (iii) Not later than thirty days prior to such date of sale, the department of finance shall submit to the council a list, disaggregated by council district, of all properties for which property owners returned a completed eligibility checklist to the department of finance at least thirty-five days prior to the date of sale, but for which property owners have not yet submitted a completed application for the appropriate exemption, credit or other benefit.

The department of finance and the department of environmental protection shall, to the extent practicable, contact by telephone or electronic mail any person who (i) has registered their telephone number or electronic mail address with such departments and (ii) has received the ninety-day notice described in paragraph one of this subdivision. Any such contact shall be made within a time period reasonably proximate to the mailing of such notice, shall inform such person of the intention to sell a tax lien and shall provide such other information as the respective commissioner deems appropriate, which may include, but need not be limited to, the telephone numbers and electronic mail addresses of the employees designated pursuant to subdivision f of this section. Failure by the department of finance or the department of environmental protection to contact any such person by telephone or electronic mail shall not affect the validity of any sale of tax liens pursuant to this chapter.

*§ 11-321.1 Rules governing sales; eligibility of persons to purchase a tax lien or tax liens in a negotiated or competitive sale.* ::


a. The commissioner of finance may promulgate rules governing the eligibility of persons to purchase a tax lien or tax liens in a negotiated or competitive sale. Such rules may provide for precertification of such persons, including a requirement for disclosure of income, assets, and any other financial information that the commissioner of finance deems appropriate, and may prohibit any such person who is delinquent in the payment of any taxes to the city of New York, or who is in default in or on any other obligation to the city, or who has any outstanding violations of the administrative code of the city of New York, from purchasing a tax lien or tax liens.

b. Any person who intends to purchase a tax lien or tax liens in a negotiated or competitive sale shall submit to the commissioner of finance an affidavit establishing compliance with the applicable eligibility criteria and including any other information required by the commissioner of finance. No such person who fails to submit such affidavit shall be permitted to purchase a tax lien or tax liens. Any such person who willfully submits a false or misleading affidavit pursuant to this section shall forfeit any tax lien or tax liens purchased by him or her at a sale for which the affidavit was submitted, shall be liable for payment of the full purchase price of the tax lien or tax liens, shall forfeit any deposit paid, and shall be disqualified from bidding or participating in any tax lien sale in the city for a period of five years.

c. No sale of a tax lien or tax liens shall be made to any person identified pursuant to section 11-309 of this chapter as having an interest in the property which is the subject of the tax lien or tax liens, or to any owner of record as shown on the real property records of the office of the city register in any borough or in the office of the Richmond county clerk. Any such person or owner of record who purchases such tax lien or tax liens shall forfeit such tax lien or tax liens and shall be liable for payment of the full purchase price of the tax lien or tax liens and shall not be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid by such person or owner of record.

Any such person who knowingly or negligently transfers or assigns such tax lien certificate or tax lien certificates to such person or owner of record shall be liable for payment of the full purchase price of the tax lien or tax liens and shall not be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid and such tax lien certificate or tax lien certificates shall be deemed void and the tax lien or tax liens sold under such certificate or such certificates shall revert to the city as if no sale of such tax lien or tax liens had occurred.






*§ 11-322 Postponement or cancellation of sales; installment agreements.* ::


a. It shall be lawful for the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, to postpone or cancel any proposed sale of a tax lien or tax liens on property that shall have been advertised and noticed for sale prior to the date of sale. For purposes of this section, the words, "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter. The city shall not be liable for any damages as a result of cancellation or postponement of a proposed sale of a tax lien or tax liens, nor shall any cause of action arise from such cancellation or postponement.

b. In accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioners of finance and environmental protection, a property owner, or other eligible person, as defined by rule, acting on behalf of an owner, may enter into agreements with the departments of finance and environmental protection for the payment in installments of any delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, or any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter. The proposed sale of a tax lien or tax liens on property shall be cancelled when a property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, enters into an agreement with the respective agency for the payment of any such lien. Such rules shall also provide that such property owners or such other eligible persons be given information regarding eligibility for real property tax exemption programs prior to entering into such agreements. As used in this subdivision, the term "other eligible person" shall include a fiduciary, as defined in paragraph three of subdivision (a) of section 11-1.1 of the estates, powers and trusts law, acting with respect to the administration of the property of an estate of a decedent who owned the real property as to which an agreement under this subdivision is sought, or on behalf of a beneficiary of such real property from such estate. Any rules promulgated in accordance with this subdivision defining "other eligible person" shall include in such definition the means by which a beneficiary of real property of the estate of a decedent who owned real property as to which an agreement under this subdivision is sought meets the definition of "other eligible person." Such means shall include the furnishing of any death certificates or other relevant documents that substantiate the claim of a beneficiary that they are the legal owner of the property. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no more than one such agreement with each respective agency may be in effect for a property at any one time.

   1. If payments required from a property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, pursuant to such an agreement are not made for a period of six months, such property owner, or such other eligible person, shall be in default of such agreement, and the tax lien or tax liens on the subject property may be sold, provided, however, that such default may be cured upon such property owner's, or such other eligible person's, bringing all installment payments and all current charges that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status, which shall include, but not be limited to, any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of sale, provided, however, that such property owner, or such other eligible person, may elect to cure such default by entering into a new installment agreement with a down payment of twenty percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of sale. If such default is not cured prior to the date of sale, such property owner, and any other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless there is a finding of extenuating circumstances by the department that entered into the installment agreement with the property owner or such other eligible person. Notwithstanding the prohibition against entering into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, a property owner, or such other eligible person, who has defaulted on an installment agreement and whose lien has been sold and, subsequent to the sale of the lien, whose property on which the lien was sold is subject to another tax lien that is eligible to be sold, may elect to enter into another installment agreement with respect to such other lien before the end of such five-year period, provided that such property owner, or such other eligible person, makes a down payment of twenty percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of the sale. No such property owner, or such other eligible person, may make the election that is authorized pursuant to this paragraph to enter into an installment agreement with a down payment more than once for the subject property. The standards relating to defaults and cures of defaults of installment agreements set forth in this paragraph apply to installment agreements entered into pursuant to such election.

   2. An installment agreement shall provide for payments by the property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, on a quarterly or monthly basis, for a period not less than eight years and not more than ten years, provided that a property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, may elect a period less than eight years. Except as provided in paragraph one of this subdivision, there shall be no down payment required upon the property owner's, or such other eligible person's, entering into the installment agreement with the respective department, but the property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, may elect to make a down payment. With respect to installment agreements with the commissioner of environmental protection, the determination of whether payments shall be on a quarterly or monthly basis shall be in the discretion of such commissioner, except as provided in paragraph three of this subdivision. With respect to installment agreements with the commissioner of finance, the determination of whether payments shall be on a quarterly or monthly basis shall be in the discretion of the property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner.

   3. Beginning January first, two thousand twelve, any property owner who has entered into an installment agreement with the commissioner of environmental protection pursuant to this subdivision and who has automated meter reading shall receive a consolidated monthly bill for current sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents and any payment due under such installment agreement.

   4. No later than September first, two thousand eleven, the commissioners of finance and environmental protection shall promulgate rules governing installment agreements, including but not limited to, the terms and conditions of such agreements, the payment schedules, and the definition and consequences of default; no later than June first, two thousand fourteen, the commissioners of finance and environmental protection shall promulgate rules governing eligibility of owners or other eligible persons acting on behalf of owners to enter into installment agreements.

   5. All installment agreements executed on or after March first, two thousand fifteen shall include a conspicuous statement that if payments required from a property owner pursuant to such an agreement are not made for a period of six months, such property owner shall be in default of such agreement, and the tax lien or tax liens on the subject property may be sold, provided, however, that such default may be cured upon such property owner's bringing all installment payments and all current charges that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status, which shall include, but not be limited to, any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of sale. Such statement shall also include a notification that if such default is not cured prior to the date of sale, such property owner shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless there is a finding of extenuating circumstances in accordance with rules promulgated by the department that entered into the installment agreement with the property owner. Such statement shall include the definition of extenuating circumstances. All installment agreements executed on or after the effective date of the local law that added this sentence shall also include a statement describing the conditions under which the property owner, or any other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, may be eligible, after default, to enter into another installment agreement after such default, in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision.

   6. If a property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, who has entered into an installment agreement with the department of finance, fails to make a payment pursuant to such agreement, then the department of finance shall, after the first missed payment, mail a letter to the property owner, or other eligible person acting on behalf of an owner, stating that such owner, or other eligible person, is at risk of being in default of such agreement. The letter shall be mailed after the first missed payment if the department has not received payment within two weeks of the due date.

      (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a) of this paragraph and provided that section 581 of the real property tax law is in effect in the same form as such section was in effect as of the effective date of the local law that added this section, for property that is a dwelling unit in a condominium subject to an installment agreement under this section and for which an appraisal has not been obtained pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision g of this section, any time the amount of the liens subject to such agreement exceeds 50 percent of the net equity in such property, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against such property that exceed 50 percent of the net equity in such property as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in the installment agreement. For property that is a dwelling unit in a condominium and for which an appraisal has been obtained pursuant to paragraph 4 of subdivision g of this section, any time the amount of the liens subject to an installment agreement under this section exceeds the higher of (i) 50 percent of the net equity in such property based on the fair market value determined by the department; or (ii) 25 percent of the net equity in such property based on the fair market value determined by the appraisal obtained by the applicant, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against such property that exceed the higher of the amounts described by clause (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in the installment agreement.

      (c) The department shall provide each applicant with a written projection at the time the installment agreement is entered into as to when the 25 or 50 percent threshold, as determined pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph, will be exceeded. The department shall also notify each property owner in writing when the amount of the liens exceeds such threshold. Failure by the department to provide an applicant with such projection or to notify a property owner when the amount of the liens exceeds the applicable threshold, however, shall not affect the validity of the installment agreement that has been entered into, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to provide such projection or such notification.

   5. If at any time the department determines that the fair market value of a property subject to an installment agreement under this section has increased, an applicant may request that the net equity in such property be recalculated and the net equity amount included in such installment agreement be adjusted to reflect the recalculated net equity in such property.

   6. If the combined income of all of the property owners exceeds $58,399 for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of making a renewal application pursuant to subdivision h of this section, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges imposed against the property after the date of such renewal application as such taxes and charges become due, in addition to the payment amount set forth in such installment agreement.

k. Termination of installment agreement.

   1. An installment agreement shall be terminated when any of the following occurs:

      (g) The applicant has defaulted on the installment agreement and has cured such default by entering into a new installment agreement pursuant to clause (2) or (3) of subparagraph (a) of paragraph 3 of this subdivision.

   2. If an installment agreement is terminated, all taxes and charges that accrued before such termination are required to be paid. If such taxes and charges are not paid within nine months of such termination, the tax lien or tax liens on such property may be sold. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if an agreement is terminated pursuant to subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of this subdivision, a surviving spouse has 18 months from the death of the applicant to pay all taxes and charges on such property before the tax lien or tax liens on such property may be sold. If such surviving spouse is a property owner he or she may enter into a separate installment agreement pursuant to section 11-322 or subdivision l, m or n of this section, as long as he or she meets the eligibility requirements for the respective installment agreement.

   3. Cure of default.

      (a) An applicant may cure a default by:

         (1) bringing all installment payments and all current charges, including but not limited to any interest and fees, that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status prior to the date of the tax lien sale;

         (2) entering into a new installment agreement with a down payment of 20 percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of such sale; or

         (3) entering into a new installment agreement under this section if the department has made a finding of extenuating circumstances pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York.

      (b) If a default is not cured prior to the date of the tax lien sale, such applicant shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless the department has made a finding of extenuating circumstances pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York.

      (c) Notwithstanding the prohibition in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph against entering into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, an applicant who has defaulted on an installment agreement and whose lien has been sold and, after the sale of the lien, whose property on which the lien was sold is subject to another tax lien that is eligible to be sold, may apply to enter into another installment agreement with respect to such other lien before the end of such five-year period, provided that such applicant makes a down payment of 20 percent, or more, of all delinquent real property taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents and other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, including any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of the tax lien sale. An applicant shall not be eligible to enter an installment agreement with a down payment under this subparagraph more than once for the subject property.

      (d) If a property owner who has entered into an installment agreement with the department pursuant to this section fails to make a payment pursuant to such agreement, the department shall, after the first missed payment, mail a letter or send an email, when such address is known, to the property owner stating that such owner is at risk of being in default of such agreement. The letter or email shall be sent after the first missed payment if the department has not received payment within two weeks of the due date. Failure by the department to mail such letter or send such email, however, shall not affect the validity of the installment agreement that has been entered into, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to mail such letter or send such email.

l. Senior low-income installment agreement.

   1. At the option of the applicant, a senior low-income installment agreement may provide for payments for a fixed period of time or for payments without a fixed period of time. If the applicant selects an installment agreement with a fixed time period, the applicant may select the term of the agreement. The applicant may switch from an installment agreement without a fixed time period to an installment agreement with a fixed time period, or from an installment agreement with a fixed time period to an installment agreement without a fixed time period, at any point.

   2. A senior low-income installment agreement shall provide for the payment of both a percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued, if any, and a percentage of taxes and charges that will accrue after the date of the installment agreement. The applicant may elect to pay an installment amount based on zero percent, 25 percent, 50 percent or 75 percent of the annual taxes and charges that have accrued, if any, and that will accrue. If the applicant selects an agreement with a fixed time period, the required payment shall be based on the percentage selected and the term selected. If the applicant selects an agreement without a fixed time period, the required payment shall be based on the percentage selected for prospective taxes and charges and a partial or full payment of the percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued, if any. The applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period.

m. Fixed length income-based installment agreement.

   1. At the option of the applicant, a fixed length income-based installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision may provide for the payment of (i) only taxes and charges that have accrued or (ii) taxes and charges that have accrued and taxes and charges that will accrue over the next fiscal year. If option (i) is selected, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges that become due on the property after the installment agreement is entered into in addition to the payment schedule provided in the installment agreement. If option (ii) is selected, the applicant shall pay all taxes and charges that will accrue on the property after the installment agreement has been in effect for one year in addition to the payment schedule provided in the installment agreement.

   2. The annual payment amount required pursuant to an installment agreement described by this subdivision shall be based on a percentage of the combined income of all of the property owners for the income tax year immediately preceding the initial application for such installment agreement. The applicant may select a percentage of two percent, four percent, six percent or eight percent of such combined income. The installment payment shall be calculated by dividing the annual payment amount by 12 or four, depending on whether a monthly or quarterly payment schedule is selected. The term of the agreement shall be calculated by dividing the taxes and charges included in the agreement pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision by the installment payment determined by the calculation described in this paragraph.

   3. An applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period.

n. Extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement.

   1. An extenuating circumstances income-based installment agreement shall provide for the payment, during the period of such agreement, of a percentage of taxes and charges that have accrued on the property and taxes and charges that accrue after the date of the installment agreement.

   2. The annual payment amount required pursuant to an installment agreement described by this subdivision shall be based on a percentage of the combined income of all of the property owners for the income tax year immediately preceding the initial application for an installment agreement. The applicant may select a percentage of two percent, four percent, six percent, or eight percent of such combined income. Such installment payment shall be calculated by dividing the annual payment amount by 12 or four, depending on whether a monthly or quarterly payment schedule is selected. The installment agreement shall be for a term of one year but may be extended on a yearly basis if the department determines that the extenuating circumstances continue.

   3. An applicant may adjust the payment percentage at any point during the installment agreement, but may not make more than one such adjustment during any six-month period.

o. After an applicant has entered into an installment agreement with the department pursuant to this section, the department shall record the entry of such agreement on the automated city register information access system. Failure by the department to record such agreement, however, shall in no manner affect the validity of such agreement, nor shall any claim arise or exist against the commissioner of finance or any officer or agency of the city by reason of such failure to record.

p. All installment agreements executed pursuant to this section on or after the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision shall include:

   1. a statement that if payments required from an applicant pursuant to such an agreement are not made for a period of six months, such applicant shall be in default of such agreement, and the tax lien or tax liens on the subject property may be sold, provided, however, that such default may be cured upon such applicant’s bringing all installment payments and all current charges that are outstanding at the time of the default to a current status, which shall include, but not be limited to, any outstanding interest and fees, prior to the date of the tax lien sale;

   2. a notification that if such default is not cured prior to the date of the tax lien sale, such property owner shall not be eligible to enter into an installment agreement for the subject property for five years, unless a finding of extenuating circumstances has been made by the department pursuant to the process described in paragraph (4) of subdivision (e) of section 40-03 of title 19 of the rules of the city of New York;

*§ 11-324 Deposits and forfeits.* ::


The commissioner of finance may require from each purchaser of a tax lien or tax liens, in cash or cash equivalent in immediately available funds in the discretion of such commissioner, a deposit of at least five per cent of the cash portion of the sale price of the tax lien or tax liens purchased by him or her, as liquidated damages, on a date determined by the commissioner of finance. The balance shall be paid to the commissioner of finance in cash or cash equivalent in immediately available funds or such other consideration acceptable to the commissioner of finance or any combination thereof, in his or her discretion. For purposes of this chapter "cash equivalent" shall mean a cashier's check, bank check, certified check, money order, or such other paper instrument as the commissioner of finance shall prescribe. Such deposit and balance may also be paid by electronic funds transfer. For purposes of this chapter, "electronic funds transfer" shall mean any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft or similar paper instrument, which is initiated using a format prescribed by the commissioner of finance. A tax lien certificate shall be made and delivered to the purchaser upon payment of the sale price. In case any purchaser shall default in any obligation under the terms and conditions of the tax lien sale, then the amount deposited by the purchaser shall be forfeited to the city, and the tax lien or tax liens upon the property affected by such purchase may be sold again at the discretion of the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-319 of this chapter. All deposits forfeited as aforesaid shall be paid into the general fund.






*§ 11-325 City may bid in on tax sale. [Repealed]* ::


A tax lien certificate shall operate to transfer and assign the tax lien upon the property described therein for the taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any notices and advertisements given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon.






*§ 11-328 Contents of a tax lien certificate.* ::


A tax lien certificate shall contain a transfer and assignment by the city of the tax lien sold to the purchaser, the date of the sale, the aggregate amount of the tax lien so transferred, and the items of taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon comprising the tax lien, the rate of interest which the tax lien certificate will bear, the date when the amounts under such tax lien are due pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and a description of the property affected by the tax lien, which description shall include the designation of such property on the tax map, by its lot number and the number of the block in which it is contained, and such other identifying information as the commissioner of finance or his or her designee may deem proper to add. For purposes of this section, the words "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter. Each tax lien certificate shall be executed by the commissioner of finance or his or her designee by manual or facsimile signature and shall be acknowledged by the manual or facsimile signature of the officer subscribing the same in the manner in which a deed is required to be acknowledged to be recorded in the county in which the property affected is situated. The commissioner of finance may designate an agent for purposes of authenticating any such signature.






*§ 11-329 Sale of transfers of tax liens by the city; procedure. [Repealed]* ::


The commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall keep in his or her office a public record of sales of tax liens, and a copy of each tax lien certificate issued by such commissioner or his or her designee. Assignments of tax lien certificates duly acknowledged may be filed and recorded in the office of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee. A tax lien certificate and any assignment thereof, duly acknowledged, shall be deemed conveyances under article eight of the real property law, and may be recorded in the office of the recording officer of any county in which the real property which it affects is situated. Tax lien certificates and all assignments thereof shall be recorded by recording officers in the same manner as mortgages and assignments thereof, but without payment of tax under article eleven of the tax law. Neither the tax lien nor the rights transferred or created by a tax lien certificate shall be impaired by failure of a recording officer to record a tax lien certificate made by the city through the commissioner of finance or his or her designee.






*§ 11-331 Records to be competent evidence.* ::


The record in the office of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee of sales of tax liens, of a tax lien certificate, and of a copy of a tax lien certificate, and of an assignment of a tax lien certificate, a record of a tax lien certificate in the office of a recording officer, and of an assignment of tax lien certificate, duly acknowledged, in the office of a recording officer, shall each be evidence in any court in the state without further proof. A transcript of any record enumerated in this section, duly certified, shall be evidence in any court in the state with like effect as the original instrument of record.






*§ 11-332 Rights of purchaser of tax lien.* ::


a. Any purchaser of a tax lien or tax liens shall stand in the same position as the city and shall have all the rights and remedies that the city would have had if the tax lien or tax liens had not been sold.

b. The aggregate amount of each tax lien transferred pursuant to this chapter shall be due and payable one year from the date of the sale. Until such aggregate amount is fully paid and discharged, the holder of the tax lien certificate shall be entitled to receive interest on such aggregate amount from the date of sale, and semi-annually at the rate of interest applicable in accordance with section 11-319 of this chapter. If such aggregate amount is partially paid, the holder of the tax lien certificate shall be entitled to receive interest only on the amount that remains unpaid. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the holder of the tax lien certificate shall be entitled to receive and retain a surcharge equal to five percent of the lien arising pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as a result of the nonpayment of taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, and interest and penalties thereon. Any amounts due shall be paid directly to the holder of the tax lien certificate. At the option of the holder of any tax lien certificate the aggregate amount thereof shall become subject to foreclosure after default in the payment of interest for thirty days or after default for six months after the date of sale stated in the tax lien certificate in accordance with sections 11-320(d) and 11-328 of this chapter in the payment of any taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, or the interest or penalties thereon which become a lien on or after the date of sale of the tax lien transferred by such tax lien certificate. At his or her option, the holder of the tax lien certificate may satisfy any such subsequent tax lien on the same property, and shall, by virtue of such satisfaction, be deemed to be in the same position as if he or she were a purchaser of a tax lien certificate for such subsequent tax lien, provided, however, that such holder shall not be entitled to receive a five percent surcharge on such subsequent tax lien pursuant to this section. The rate of interest on such subsequent lien shall be the rate of interest applicable to tax lien certificates pursuant to section 11-319 of this chapter. The commissioner of finance or his or her designee, at the request of the purchaser of such subsequent lien, shall issue a tax lien certificate for such lien pursuant to sections 11-327 and 11-328 of this chapter. Upon issuance of such certificate, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall provide such notice as is required pursuant to section 11-320(d) of this chapter. Failure to provide notice pursuant to this subdivision shall not affect the validity of any transfer of a subsequent tax lien or tax liens pursuant to this subdivision. Any person having a legal or beneficial interest in property affected by a tax lien certificate may satisfy the same at any time upon payment of the amounts due with interest at the rate applicable in accordance with section 11-319 of this chapter. Upon satisfaction of the tax lien, the holder thereof shall issue to the person who satisfied such tax lien a certificate of discharge, certifying that the tax lien has been paid or has been otherwise satisfied, in such recordable form as has been approved by the commissioner of finance. For purposes of this section, the words, "date of sale" shall have the same meaning provided in section 11-320(e) of this chapter.






*§ 11-333 Discharge of tax lien.* ::


A tax lien sold pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be discharged by presenting the certificate of discharge issued by the holder of the tax lien pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter to the recording officer of the county in which the real property that it affects is situated, and any recording officer to whom such certificate of discharge is presented shall record the same.






*§ 11-334 Exemption from taxation.* ::


Tax liens and tax lien certificates shall be exempt from taxation by the state or any local subdivisions thereof, except from the taxes imposed by article ten of the tax law. The real property affected by any tax lien shall not be exempt from taxation by reason of this section.






*§ 11-335 Foreclosure of tax liens.* ::


If the amount of any tax lien which shall have been transferred by a tax lien certificate shall not be paid when under its terms and the provisions of section 11-332 of this chapter such amount shall be due, the holder of such tax lien certificate may maintain an action in the supreme court to foreclose such tax lien. The holder of such tax lien certificate shall notify the commissioner of finance or his or her designee in writing whenever he or she commences such action at the time of filing of such action, and shall notify the commissioner of finance in writing of the resolution of such action, including any settlement of such action, within thirty days of such resolution. In an action to foreclose a tax lien any person shall be a proper party of whom the plaintiff alleges that such person has or may have or that the plaintiff has reason to believe that such person has or may have an interest in or claim upon the property affected by the tax lien. A plaintiff in an action to foreclose a tax lien shall recover reasonable attorney's fees for maintaining such action. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be regulated by the provisions of the civil practice law and rules and by all other provisions of law, and rules of practice applicable to actions to foreclose mortgages on real property. The people of the state of New York or the city of New York may be made party to an action to foreclose a tax lien in the same manner as a natural person. Where the people of the state of New York or the city of New York are made a party defendant the complaint shall set forth, in addition to the other matters required to be set forth by law, detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on such property of the people of the state of New York or the city of New York, and detailed facts showing the particular nature of the interest in or the lien on such property which plaintiff has reason to believe that the people of the state of New York or the city of New York has or may have in such property, and the reason for making the people of the state of New York or the city of New York a party defendant. Upon failure to state such facts the complaint shall be dismissed as to the people of the state or the city of New York.






*§ 11-336 Pleading tax lien certificate.* ::


Whenever a cause of action, defense or counterclaim, is for the foreclosure of a tax lien, or is in any manner founded upon a tax lien or a tax lien certificate, the production in evidence of an instrument executed by the commissioner of finance or his or her designee in the form prescribed in section 11-328 of this chapter for a tax lien certificate subscribed by or in behalf of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee shall be presumptive evidence that the lien purported to be transferred by such an instrument was a valid and enforceable lien, and that it has been duly assigned to the purchaser, and it shall not be necessary to plead or prove any act, proceeding, notice or action, preceding the delivery of such tax lien certificate nor to establish the validity of the tax lien transferred by such tax lien certificate. If a party or person in interest in any such action or proceeding claims that a tax lien is irregular or invalid, or that there is any defect therein or that a tax lien certificate is irregular, invalid or defective, such invalidity, irregularity or defect must be specifically pleaded or set forth, and must be established affirmatively by the party or person pleading or setting forth the same.






*§ 11-337 Judgment upon tax lien.* ::


In every action for the foreclosure of a tax lien, and in every action or proceeding in which a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is in any manner founded upon a tax lien or a tax lien certificate, such tax lien certificate and the tax lien which it transfers shall be presumed to be regular and valid and effectual to transfer to the purchaser named therein a valid and enforceable tax lien. Unless in such an action or proceeding such tax lien or tax lien certificate be found to be invalid, they shall be adjudged to be enforceable and valid, for the amount thereof and the interest to which the holder may be entitled and a tax lien transferred by a tax lien certificate effectual to transfer such tax lien to the purchaser named therein.






*§ 11-338 Judgment of foreclosure of tax lien; sale.* ::


In an action to foreclose a tax lien, unless the defendants obtain judgment, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment establishing the validity of the tax lien so far as the same shall not be adjudged invalid and of the tax lien certificate and directing the sale of the real, personal or mixed property affected thereby, or such part thereof as shall be sufficient to discharge the tax lien, or such items thereof as shall not be adjudged invalid together with the expense of the sale, and the costs of the action.






*§ 11-339 City may purchase at sale.* ::


At a sale pursuant to judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien or at any sale free of tax liens, the city, without authorization other than hereby given, may purchase any property that is the subject of the sale.






*§ 11-340 Effect of judgment foreclosing tax lien.* ::


Every final judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be binding upon, and every conveyance upon a sale pursuant thereto, shall transfer to and vest in the purchaser all the right, title, interest and estate in and claim upon the real property affected by such judgment, of the plaintiff, each defendant upon whom the summons is served, each person claiming from, through or under such a defendant by title accruing after the filing of notice of pendency of the action or after the entry of judgment and filing of the judgment roll in the proper county clerk's office, and each person not in being when the judgment is rendered, who afterwards may become entitled to a beneficial interest attaching to, or an estate or interest in such real property or any portion thereof, provided that the person presumptively entitled to such beneficial interest, estate or interest is a party to such action or bound by such judgment. So much of section three hundred seventeen of the civil practice law and rules as requires the court to allow a defendant to defend an action after final judgment shall not apply to an action to foreclose a tax lien. Delivery of the possession of real property affected by a judgment to foreclose a tax lien may be compelled in the manner prescribed in section two hundred twenty-one of the real property actions and proceedings law.






*§ 11-341 Surplus.* ::


Any surplus of the proceeds of the sale, after paying the expenses of the sale, and all taxes, assessments, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, water rents, any other charges made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, any surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter and interest and penalties thereon, including such amounts which accrued or became a lien on and after the date of sale of the tax lien or tax liens and up to and including the date of the sale of the property in foreclosure, and satisfying the amount of such tax lien or tax liens and interest and the costs of the action, must be paid into court, for the use of the person or persons entitled thereto. If any part of the surplus remains in court for the period of three months, and no application has been made therefor, the court must, and, if an application therefor is pending, the court may direct such surplus to be invested at interest, for the benefit of the person or persons entitled thereto, to be paid upon the direction of the court.






*§ 11-342 Foreclosed tax lien not arrears.* ::


Any party to an action to foreclose a tax lien or any purchaser or any party in interest may give notice of such foreclosure to the city collector and after such notice the items which constituted the tax lien thus foreclosed shall not be entered by the city collector in any yearly assessment-roll, so long as the judgment of foreclosure of such lien remains in force.






*§ 11-343 Reimbursement for unenforceable tax liens or transfers of tax liens. [Repealed]* ::


It shall be the duty of the corporation counsel to protect the interest of the city in all matters, actions and proceedings relating to tax liens and tax lien certificates; to intervene on behalf of the city or to make the city a party to any action in which the corporation counsel believes it to be to the interest of the city so to do, by reason of any matter arising under or relating to any tax lien or tax lien certificate, or advertisement of sale of tax liens. The corporation counsel in his or her discretion may represent the purchaser of a tax lien or the holder of a tax lien certificate in any action in which the corporation counsel believes it to be in the interest of the city so to do, by reason of any matter arising under or relating to any tax lien or tax lien certificate, or advertisement of sale of tax liens. All costs recovered in any action or proceeding conducted or defended by the corporation counsel pursuant to this section shall belong to the city and shall be collected, applied and disposed of in the same manner as are other costs recovered by the city.






*§ 11-348 Defective or invalid transfer of tax lien; proceeding anew. [Repealed]* ::


Whenever any tax lien certificate given by the commissioner of finance or his or her designee, as in this chapter provided, shall be lost, the commissioner of finance or his or her designee may receive evidence of such loss, and on satisfactory proof of the fact may direct the execution and delivery of a duplicate to such person or persons who shall appear entitled thereto, and may also, in the commissioner's discretion, require a bond of indemnity to the city.






*§ 11-350 Affidavits of publication and mailing of necessary notices to be preserved.* ::


It shall be the duty of the commissioner of finance or his or her designee to procure, preserve and register at the department of finance, affidavits of the publication and mailing of all the advertisements and notices by this chapter required to be published and mailed, and such affidavits shall be presumptive proof of such publication and mailing in all the courts of this state.






*§ 11-353 Cancellation of taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, any charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon.* ::


Whenever the city has heretofore or shall hereafter become vested with title to property acquired by virtue of tax enforcement foreclosure proceedings, or by deed in lieu thereof, the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall cancel all unpaid real estate taxes, tax lien certificates, assessments, water rents, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, any charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon upon which the foreclosure action was predicated. Upon the sale of such property and the conveyance of the title thereof by the city, the commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall cancel all unpaid real estate taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rents, sewer surcharges, any charges that are made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter, the costs of any advertisements and notices given pursuant to this chapter, any other charges that are due and payable, a surcharge pursuant to section 11-332 of this chapter, and interest and penalties thereon that shall have accrued during the period between the date of the last unpaid item upon which the foreclosure action was predicated and the date of conveyance of title. The commissioner of finance, or his or her designee, shall enter notations of such cancellations in the appropriate records for each such parcel of property.






*§ 11-354 Additional method to enforce payment of tax liens held by the city.* ::


(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law and notwithstanding any omission to hold a tax lien sale, whenever any tax, assessment, sewer rent, sewer surcharge, water rent, any charge that is made a lien subject to the provisions of this chapter or chapter four of this title, or interest and penalties thereon, has been due and unpaid for a period of at least one year from the date on which the tax, assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien, or in the case of any class one property or any class two property that is a residential condominium or residential cooperative, as such classes of property are defined in subdivision one of section eighteen hundred two of the real property tax law, or in the case of a multiple dwelling owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, for a period of at least three years from the date on which the tax, assessment or other legal charge became a lien, the city, as owner of a tax lien, may maintain an action in the supreme court to foreclose such lien. Such action shall be governed by the procedures set forth in section 11-335 of this chapter; provided, however, that such parcel shall only be sold to the highest responsible bidder. Such purchaser shall be deemed qualified as a responsible bidder pursuant to such criteria as are established in rules promulgated by the commissioner of finance after consultation with the commissioner of housing preservation and development.

(b) At a sale pursuant to a judgment in an action brought pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section to foreclose a tax lien, the city may purchase property subject to such lien in accordance with the provisions of section 11-339 of this chapter.

(c) The provisions of this section shall not affect any existing remedy or procedure for the enforcement or foreclosure of tax liens provided for in this code or any other law, but the remedy provided herein for foreclosure of tax liens shall be in addition to any other remedies or procedures provided by any general, special or local law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this code, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to agree to forebear to commence an in rem action against property which has an outstanding and unredeemed tax lien certificate previously sold by the city and held by a third party pursuant to this chapter.

*§ 11-405 Preparation and filing of lists of delinquent taxes.* ::


a. The commissioner of finance from time to time shall prepare a list, to be known as a "list of delinquent taxes", of all parcels, or all parcels within a particular class or classes, that are within a particular borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map of the city and on which there are tax liens subject to foreclosure pursuant to this chapter, provided, however, that no such portion shall be smaller than a block, as defined in subdivision d of section 11-204 of subchapter one of chapter two of this title. Every such list shall bear a caption containing the in rem action number of the city's tax foreclosure proceeding, the borough or the section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, and where the action covers less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, the particular class or classes, and shall contain a statement of the rate or rates at which interest and penalties will be computed for the various liens it includes.

b. Every such list shall set forth the parcels it includes separately and number them serially. For each parcel it shall contain (1) a brief description sufficient to identify the parcel, including section, block and lot numbers, and the street and street number, if any, or in the absence of such information the parcel or tract identification number shown on a tax map or on a map filed in the county clerk's or register's office and (2) a statement of the amounts and dates of all unpaid tax liens which are subject to foreclosure under this chapter and of those which have accrued thereafter.

c. (1) The commissioner of finance may exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcels (i) as to which questions the commissioner deems meritorious have been raised regarding the validity of the liens, (ii) as to which all the taxes and other charges which rendered said parcels eligible for inclusion in said list have been paid, or (iii) which are owned by an entity other than a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development and which are not owner-occupied residential buildings of not more than five residential units and as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, interest and penalties in installments. The first installment shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount of not less than fifteen percent of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, interest and penalties. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first day of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments unpaid real estate taxes which are, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

   (2) The commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcels which are owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, and (i) as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with said commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges incurred prior to the ownership of said parcel by said article XI company, and the interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount of not less than ten percent of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalty thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed forty-eight in number shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments unpaid real estate taxes which are, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis; and (ii) as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with said commissioner, for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges incurred after the ownership of said parcel by said article XI company on the same terms as are provided in paragraph one of this subdivision.

   (3) The commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcels which are owner-occupied residential buildings of not more than five residential units as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with said commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments, or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount not less than ten percent of such delinquent taxes, assessment or other legal charges and the interest and penalty thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed forty-eight in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments unpaid real estate taxes which are, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, due and payable on an other than quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

   (4) Notwithstanding paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision, with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed on or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcel that is (i)(A) a residential building containing not more than five residential units, (B) a residential condominium unit, (C) a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership or (D) owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, and (ii) as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount equal to not less than ten percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

   (5) Notwithstanding paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision, with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed on or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcel of class one or class two real property, other than a parcel described in paragraph four of this subdivision, as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount equal to not less than fifteen percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

   (6) Notwithstanding paragraph one, two or three of this subdivision, with respect to installment agreements duly made, executed and filed on or after the date on which this paragraph takes effect, the commissioner of finance may also exclude or thereafter remove from such list any parcel of class three or class four real property as to which an agreement has been duly made, executed and filed with such commissioner for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, in installments. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner and shall be in an amount equal to not less than fifteen percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

   (7) A parcel for which any such installment agreement or agreements have been filed with the commissioner shall be excluded or removed from the list of delinquent taxes before the commencement of the in rem action based upon such list only if the amounts paid pursuant to such agreement exceed the amount required to pay all taxes and charges which render said parcel eligible for inclusion in the in rem action and there has been no default in such agreement prior to the commencement of said action as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges.

   (8) As a condition to entering into any agreement under this section or section 11-409 of this chapter, the commissioner shall have received from the applicant, an affidavit stating that each tenant located on the parcel has been notified by certified mail that an application for an installment agreement will be made and that a copy of a standard agreement form has been included with such notification. Any false statement in such affidavit shall not be grounds to cancel the agreement or affect its validity in any way.

d. Two duplicate originals thereof, verified by the commissioner of finance or a subordinate designated by the commissioner, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the parcels listed therein are situated. Such filing shall constitute and have the same force and effect as the filing and recording in such office of an individual and separate notice of pendency of action and as the filing in the supreme court in such county of an individual and separate complaint by the city as to each parcel described in said list, to enforce the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other lawful charges which have accumulated and become liens against such parcels.

e. Each county clerk with whom such a list of delinquent taxes is filed shall, on the date of said filing, place and thereafter maintain one duplicate original copy thereof, as separately and permanently bound by the commissioner of finance, adjacent to and together with the block index of notices of pendency of action and each county clerk shall, on the date of said filing or as soon thereafter as with due diligence is practicable, docket the parcels contained in the list of delinquent taxes in said block index of notices of pendency of action, which shall constitute due filing, recording and indexing of the separate notices constituting said list of delinquent taxes in lieu of any other requirement under rule sixty-five hundred eleven of the civil practice law and rules or otherwise.

f. The commissioner of finance shall file a copy of each list of delinquent taxes, certified as such copy by him or her or a subordinate designated by the commissioner, in the borough office of the city collector in the borough in which the parcels listed therein are situated and in the office of the corporation counsel.

g. The validity of any proceeding hereunder shall not be affected by any omission or error of the commissioner of finance in including or excluding parcels from any such list or in the designation of a street or street number or by any other similar omission or error.






*§ 11-406 Public notice of foreclosure.* ::


a. Upon the filing of a list of delinquent taxes in the office of the county clerk, the commissioner of finance forthwith shall cause a notice of foreclosure to be published at least once a week for six successive weeks in the City Record and, subject to section ninety-one of the judiciary law, in two newspapers, one of which may be a law journal, to be designated by the commissioner of finance, which are published in and are circulated throughout the county in which the affected property is located. If there are no newspapers published in such county, the commissioner of finance may designate newspapers published in the city of New York which are circulated throughout the affected county.

b. Such notice shall clearly indicate that it is a notice of foreclosure of tax liens; the borough or the section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map in which the properties subject to foreclosure are located and where the area affected by the action includes less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, the particular class or classes contained therein, and by a general description which need not contain measurements and direction; where and when the list of delinquent taxes was filed; the general nature of the information contained in the list; that the filing of the list constitutes commencement of a foreclosure action by the city in the supreme court for the particular county and a notice of pendency of action against each parcel listed; that such action is against the property only and no personal judgment will be entered; that the list will be available for inspection at the city collector's central office and at the borough office of the city collector in the borough in which said property is located until a specified date at least ten weeks after the date of first publication; that until such date a parcel may be redeemed by paying all taxes and charges contained in said list of delinquent taxes together with interest and penalties thereon; that during said period of redemption and for an additional period of twenty days after said last date for redemption any person having any interest in or lien upon a parcel on the list may file with the appropriate county clerk and serve upon the corporation counsel a verified answer setting forth in detail the full name of said answering party, the nature and amount of his or her interest or lien and any legal defense against foreclosure; and that in the absence of redemption or answer a judgement of foreclosure may be taken by default.

c. On or before the date of the first publication of such notice, the commissioner of finance shall cause a copy of the notice to be mailed to all owners, mortgagees, lienors or encumbrancers, who may be entitled to receive such notice by virtue of any owner's registration or in rem card filed in the office of the city collector pursuant to section 11-416 or 11-417 of this chapter. If such owner's registration or in rem cards have not been filed in the office of the city collector then said notice shall be mailed to the name and address, if any, appearing in the latest annual record of assessed valuations. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be inserted with such notice a statement substantially in the following form: "To the party to whom the enclosed notice is addressed: You are the presumptive owner or lienor of one or more of the parcels mentioned and described in the list referred to in the attached notice. Unless the taxes and assessments and all other legal charges are paid, or an answer is interposed; or an arrangement is made for payment of such taxes and assessments and all other legal charges in installments, as provided by statute, the ownership of said property will in due course pass to the city of New York as provided by the administrative code of the city of New York." The failure of the commissioner of finance to mail such notice shall not affect the validity of any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter as to any parcel other than the parcel with respect to which notice was not mailed.

d. The commissioner of finance shall cause a copy of such notice to be posted in the office of the commissioner of finance, in the county courthouse of the county in which the property subject to such tax lien is situated and at three other conspicuous places in the borough in which the affected properties are located.






*§ 11-407 Redemption.* ::


a. After the filing of a list of delinquent taxes and until a date at least ten weeks after the first publication of the public notice of foreclosure, as determined by the commissioner of finance and specified in the said notice, a person claiming to have an interest in any parcel in said list may redeem it by paying all taxes and charges contained in said list of delinquent taxes together with interest and penalties thereon.

b. Upon such redemption the commissioner of finance shall deliver to the corporation counsel a certificate of redemption. The corporation counsel shall file such certificate with the clerk of the county in which said list was filed. The filing of such certificate shall constitute and be deemed a discontinuance of the in rem action as to the affected parcel, and the county clerk shall thereupon note such redemption and discontinuance in the copy of the list of delinquent taxes maintained by him or her adjacent to the county clerk's block index of notices of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge any notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes as to said parcel that may appear in any other books, records, indices and dockets maintained in said clerk's office. The commissioner of finance shall also deliver a duplicate original certificate of redemption to the person who has redeemed.

c. When the time to redeem in an in rem tax foreclosure action has expired, any person claiming to have an interest in a parcel included in said action shall have the right to make a late redemption payment to the commissioner of finance. Such late redemption payment shall consist of all taxes and charges owing on said parcel, the lawful interest thereon to the date of payment and a penalty of five percent of said payment of taxes, charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars as to each parcel on which a late redemption payment is being made. Such late redemption payment shall be made in cash or by certified or bank check and shall be accepted by the commissioner of finance at any time after the last day to redeem up to the date on which the commissioner is advised by the corporation counsel that the preparation of the judgement of foreclosure in the in rem action has been commenced. Upon receipt of such late redemption payment, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.






*§ 11-408 Filing of affidavits.* ::


All affidavits of filing, publication, posting, mailing or other acts required by this chapter shall be made by the person or persons performing such acts and shall be filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the property subject to such tax lien is situated and shall together with all other documents required by this chapter to be filed in the office of such county clerk, constitute and become a part of the judgment roll in such foreclosure action.






*§ 11-409 Severance and trial of issues where answer is interposed; installment agreements authorized after action commenced.* ::


a. If a duly verified answer is served upon the corporation counsel not later than twenty days after the last date for redemption, the answering defendant shall have the right to a severance of the action, as to any parcel in which the defendant has pleaded an interest, upon written demand therefor filed with or made a part of his or her answer.

b. When such answer is interposed, the court shall summarily hear and determine the issues raised by the complaint and answer in the same manner as it hears and determines other actions, except as herein otherwise provided. Proof that the taxes which made said property subject to foreclosure hereunder together with interest and penalties thereon, were paid before filing of the list of delinquent taxes or that the property was not subject to tax shall constitute a complete defense.

c. No counterclaim may be asserted in an answer interposed in an action brought pursuant to this chapter. Where a counterclaim is asserted in an in rem answer the city may disregard that portion of the answer and shall suffer no legal penalty or impediment in the prosecution of its in rem action for its failure to reply or respond thereto. Where an answer contains only a counterclaim and no other defenses the city may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against the property affected without the need for moving against the answer.

d. When a verified answer alleges a substantial equity over the city's lien for taxes, the defendant may demand additional time in which to pay the taxes and interest or to have the property sold with all taxes and interest to be paid out of the proceeds of such sale. Upon such demand a defendant shall have the right to an extension of time for such purpose not in excess of six months from the last day to interpose an answer. Where a mortgagee or lienor who has interposed such answer commences a proceeding to foreclose his or her mortgage or lien and it appears that with due diligence such proceeding cannot be concluded in time to allow the payment of taxes within the aforesaid six month period, the court may, on application before the end of said six month period, authorize an additional period during which such proceeding may be concluded and the taxes, together with interest and penalties, paid.

e. Where an answer of the type described in subdivision d of this section is interposed and taxes are paid within the period set forth in such subdivision d, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to the property on which such payment has been made pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter. When taxes are not paid within the period set forth in such subdivision d, it shall be deemed that there was no equity over the city's tax liens and the answer shall be deemed to be without merit. The city in that event may proceed to judgment of foreclosure against such property without moving against the answer.

f. All answers interposed in an action hereunder and all affidavits and other papers pertaining to any litigation involving such answers or to any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter involving less than an entire action shall bear a caption containing the in rem action number of the city's tax foreclosure proceeding, the borough or the section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map affected, and if the action covers less than all parcels in an entire borough or section of a tax map or portion of a section of a tax map, the particular class or classes, and the serial, section, block and lot numbers of the parcel or parcels in issue.

g. The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as to any parcel on which an in rem answer or litigation is pending, or as to which, before the preparation of said in rem judgment roll is commenced, an agreement was duly made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest and penalties in installments as provided in subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter and there has been no default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges. Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time the aforesaid agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to acquire the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurs before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll among the parcels to be acquired by the city. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid in full the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.

h. A party who has interposed an answer as to any parcel included in an in rem tax foreclosure action, or any other party interested in such parcel, shall have the right, at any time prior to the final disposition of a motion to strike said answer, to pay all taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel. An answering party who makes such payment shall not be required to pay any penalty. Where such payment is made by other than an answering party after the expiration of the period of redemption, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance an additional amount equal to the penalty payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter. Where all delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges together with lawful interest thereon and penalties, where required, are paid, the commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter. Said parties may also pay such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest by an installment agreement. Where such agreement is requested before the preparation of the aforesaid in rem judgment roll is commenced, the terms of said agreement shall be consistent with the provisions of subdivision g or i of this section, whichever is applicable. Where such agreement is requested after judgment of foreclosure has been entered in the in rem action in which the aforesaid answer was interposed, said agreement shall require a first installment of fifty percent of all taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest owing on said parcel, a penalty of five percent of all such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars, and the payment of the balance of such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest in four equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments and other legal charges that accrue during such period. The request of an answering party for an installment agreement shall constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer. An installment agreement requested by an interested party other than the answering party shall require the consent of said answering party which shall also constitute a withdrawal of such party's answer. The severance provided for in this section shall be continued during the term of all installment agreements entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision. Where a default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which said parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to said parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.

i. (1) Notwithstanding subdivision g of this section, this subdivision shall apply with respect to installment agreements made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect. An installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision may be made, executed and filed with such commissioner during the period beginning on the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of section 11-405 of this chapter with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such agreement and ending on the date on which such commissioner is advised by the corporation counsel that the preparation of the judgment of foreclosure in such in rem action has been commenced. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, and except to the extent provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, the provisions of paragraphs one through six of subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter shall not apply to any installment agreement requested on or after the date on which this subdivision takes effect and on or after the date on which an action is commenced as provided in subdivision d of such section 11-405 with respect to the parcel that is the subject of such requested agreement.

   (2) An agreement entered into pursuant to this subdivision shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. Unless an eligible owner or other interested person requests an agreement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision, the terms of such agreement with respect to a parcel shall be the same as the terms that would be applicable to such parcel under paragraph four, five or six, as the case may be, of subdivision c of section 11-405 of this chapter, except that, for purposes of the agreement pursuant to this paragraph, the amount of the first installment shall be equal to: (i) fifteen percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph four; (ii) twenty percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph five; and (iii) twenty-five percent of the total amount due in the case of a parcel described in such paragraph six.

   (3) Instead of an agreement pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, an eligible owner or other interested party may request an agreement pursuant to the following provisions:

      (i) With respect to a parcel that is owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, such agreement shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, either thirty-five percent or fifty percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed thirty-two in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April, together with interest at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

      (ii) With respect to a parcel, other than a parcel described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, that is a residential building containing not more than five residential units, a residential condominium unit or a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership, such agreement shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, either twenty-five percent or fifty percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April together with interest at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

      (iii) With respect to any parcel of class one or class two real property, other than a parcel described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph, such agreement shall provide for the payment in installments of the delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the interest and penalties thereon, due and owing as of the date on which such agreement is requested. The first installment thereof shall be paid upon the filing of the installment agreement with the commissioner of finance and shall be in an amount at least equal to, at the applicant's election, either thirty-five percent or fifty percent of the total amount of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and the interest and penalties thereon. The remaining installments, which shall be twice the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof, but which shall in no event exceed twenty in number, shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April, together with interest at the rate or rates determined as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. For the purposes of calculating the number of such remaining installments, unpaid real estate taxes that are due and payable on other than a quarterly basis shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis.

      (iv) (A) Notwithstanding any higher rate of interest prescribed pursuant to applicable law, and unless a lower rate of interest is applicable to a delinquent amount owing on a parcel that is the subject of an agreement pursuant to this paragraph, the interest payable together with the remaining installments due under such agreement shall be:

            (I) with respect to an agreement for which a twenty-five percent or thirty-five percent down payment was made, calculated at a rate equal to the sum of (a) the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title and (b) one-half of the difference between such rate and the rate prescribed for such period pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title; or

            (II) with respect to an agreement for which a fifty percent down payment was made, calculated at a rate equal to the rate prescribed for the applicable period pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision e of section 11-224.1 of this title.

         (B) If a default occurs in any agreement executed pursuant to this paragraph as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges, the rates of interest determined under this subparagraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise prescribed pursuant to law.

   (4) The corporation counsel, when submitting an in rem judgment roll pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may request a severance as to any parcel as to which, before the preparation of said in rem judgment roll is commenced, an agreement was duly made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance for the payment of all delinquent taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest and penalties in installments as provided in this subdivision, and there has been no default in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges. Where such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time such agreements are executed an amount equal to the penalty that would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Where a default occurs in such agreement as to either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges, all payments made under the agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to obtain a judgment hereunder as to the parcel as to which the default occurred. Where such default occurred before the submission of the judgment roll, the parcels as to which such default occurs shall be included in said judgment roll amount the parcels to be acquired by the city or by a third party. Where such default has occurred as to a parcel severed pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation counsel shall cause to be entered a supplemental judgment of foreclosure as to such parcel immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default. Where such installment agreement is paid in full, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action from which such parcel was severed by issuing a certificate of withdrawal as to such parcel pursuant to the provisions of section 11-413 of this chapter.






*§ 11-410 Preference over other actions.* ::


a. Any action brought pursuant to this chapter shall be given preference over all other causes and actions.

b. Actions brought pursuant to this chapter shall take precedence over any proceeding brought to foreclose a mortgage or other lien involving the same property. A parcel included in a list of delinquent taxes which is sold in a mortgage foreclosure sale held after said list is filed may not be sold subject to taxes even if judgment has not yet been entered in the tax foreclosure action. All unpaid taxes and interest and penalties thereon must be paid, in full or by installment agreement pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, out of the proceeds of such sale regardless of whether the mortgage foreclosure lis pendens was filed before or after the filing of the tax foreclosure action, regardless of whether any party to the mortgage foreclosure proceeding has interposed an answer in the tax foreclosure action and regardless of any terms to the contrary in the judgment in the mortgage foreclosure proceeding.






*§ 11-411 Presumption of validity.* ::


It shall not be necessary for the city to plead or prove the various steps, procedures and notices for the assessment and levy of the taxes, assessments or other lawful charges against the parcels set forth in the list of delinquent taxes and all such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges and the lien thereof shall be presumed to be valid. A defendant alleging any jurisdictional defect or invalidity in such taxes, assessments or other lawful charges or in the foreclosure thereof must particularly specify in his or her answer such jurisdictional defect or invalidity and must affirmatively establish such defense. A judgment of foreclosure granted in any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter, which contains recitals that any acts were done or proceedings had which were necessary to give the court jurisdiction or power to grant such judgment of foreclosure, shall be presumptive evidence that such acts were duly performed or proceedings duly had, if such judgment of foreclosure shall have been duly entered or filed in the office of the clerk of the county in which the proceeding was pending and wherein such judgment was granted. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to and be valid and effective with respect to all defendants even though one or more of them be infants, incompetents, absentees or non-residents of the state of New York.






*§ 11-412 Final judgment.* ::


a. The court shall determine upon proof and shall make finding upon such proof whether there has been due compliance by the city with the provisions of this chapter.

b. The court shall make a final judgment awarding to the city the possession of any parcel described in the list of delinquent taxes not redeemed or withdrawn as provided in this chapter and as to which no answer is interposed as provided herein. In addition thereto, such judgment shall contain a direction to the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute and cause to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to such lands. Upon the execution of such deed, the city shall be seized of an estate in fee simple absolute in such land and all persons, including the state of New York, infants, incompetents, absentees and non-residents who may have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption in or upon such lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption, except as otherwise provided in section 11-424 of this chapter. The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees or any other persons, including administrators under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. After such termination, said receivers, trustees or administrators shall be accountable to the courts that appointed them for the faithful performance of their fiduciary obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city for any rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of title in the city. If the city serves a tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other than non-payment of rent, the acceptance of rent for the first forty-five days after termination of tenancy by anyone other than an employee of the department designated by the department to receive such rent shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.

c. Every deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein and all proceedings prior thereto from and including the assessment of the lands affected and all notices required by law were regular and in accordance with all provisions of law relating thereto. After two years from the date of the recording of such deed, the presumption shall be conclusive, unless at the time that this subdivision takes effect the two year period since the recording of the deed has expired or less than six months of such period of two years remains unexpired, in which case the presumption shall become conclusive six months after this subdivision takes effect. No action to set aside such deed may be maintained unless the action is commenced and a notice of pendency of the action is filed in the office of the proper county clerk prior to the time that the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid.






*§ 11-412.1 Special procedures relating to final judgment and release of class one and class two real property.* ::


Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary:

a. The court shall determine upon proof and shall make a finding upon such proof whether there has been due compliance by the city with the applicable provisions of this chapter.

b. (1) The court shall make a final judgment authorizing the award of possession of any parcel of class one or class two real property described in the list of delinquent taxes not redeemed or withdrawn as provided in this chapter and as to which no answer is interposed as provided herein, and authorizing the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute and cause to be recorded a deed conveying either to the city or to a third party deemed qualified and designated by the commissioner of housing preservation and development full and complete title to such lands. Any such conveyance to a third party shall be for an existing use.

   (2) Such third party shall be deemed qualified and shall be designated pursuant to such criteria as are established in rules promulgated by the commissioner of housing preservation and development, provided, however, that such criteria shall include but not be limited to: residential management experience; financial ability; rehabilitation experience; ability to work with government and community organizations; neighborhood ties; and that the commissioner shall consider whether the third party is a responsible legal tenant, not-for-profit organization or neighborhood-based-for-profit individual or organization. The commissioner shall not deem qualified any third party who has been finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction, within seven years of the date on which such third party would otherwise be deemed qualified, to have violated any section of articles one hundred fifty, one hundred seventy-five, one hundred seventy-six, one hundred eighty, one hundred eighty-five or two hundred of the penal law or any similar laws of another jurisdiction, or who has been suspended or debarred from contracting with the city or any agency of the city pursuant to section 335 of the charter during the period of such suspension or debarment. The rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph may establish other bases for disqualification of a third party.

c. Following the expiration of the four-month period prescribed in subdivision d of this section, but not more than eight months after the date on which, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of a parcel of class one or class two real property was entered, the commissioner of finance may execute a deed, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, with respect to such parcel. The owner of said parcel shall continue to have all of the rights, liabilities, responsibilities, duties and obligations of an owner of such parcel, including, but not limited to, maintaining such parcel in compliance with the housing maintenance, building and fire codes, and all other applicable laws, unless and until the commissioner of finance has prepared and executed a deed conveying to the city or to a third party full and complete title to such parcel. Upon the execution of such deed, the city or the third party shall be seized of an estate in fee simple absolute in such land and all persons, including the state of New York, infants, incompetents, absentees and non-residents who may have had any right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption in or upon such lands shall be barred and forever foreclosed of all such right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption, except as otherwise provided in subdivisions e and f of this section. The appointment and tenure of receivers, trustees or any other persons, including administrators under article seven-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, appointed by an order of a court to manage real property, shall terminate when title to such property vests in the city or a third party pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. After such termination, said receivers, trustees or administrators shall be accountable to the courts that appointed them for the faithful performance of their fiduciary obligations during the term of their appointment and to the city or such third party for any rents and income received by them for any period subsequent to the date of the vesting of title in the city or such third party. If the city serves a tenant in possession of a dwelling unit with notice of termination of tenancy on grounds other than nonpayment of rent, the acceptance of rent for the first forty-five days after termination of tenancy by anyone other than an employee of the department designated by the department to receive such rent shall not be deemed or construed as a waiver of the city's right to initiate and prosecute a proceeding to terminate the tenancy for good cause.

d. Within four months after the date on which, pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of a parcel of class one or class two real property was entered, any person claiming to have an interest in such parcel shall have the right to make a payment to the commissioner of finance consisting of all taxes, assessments and other legal charges owing on said parcel, the lawful interest thereon to the date of payment and a penalty of five percent of said payment of taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest, which penalty may not exceed one thousand dollars. Such payment shall be made in cash or by certified or bank check. Within such four-month period, such interested person may also request an installment agreement from the commissioner of finance. Such agreement shall require, in addition to full payment of the penalty specified in this subdivision at the time such agreement is entered into, the payment at such time of a first installment equal to fifty percent of all taxes, assessments and other legal charges, and the lawful interest thereon, then owing on such parcel, and the payment of the balance of such taxes, assessments and other legal charges and interest in four equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments and other legal charges that accrue during such period. Upon receipt of payment in full of the amount specified in the first sentence of this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, canceling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and vacating and setting aside the final judgment. Upon the execution of an installment agreement and payment of the amounts due at the time such agreement is executed as provided in this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order vacating and setting aside the final judgment. The entry of either such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before such final judgment was entered. Where the commissioner of finance approves an application requesting an installment agreement pursuant to this subdivision, the order vacating and setting aside the final judgment shall provide that in the event of any default as to the payment of either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges during the term of such agreement, all payments under said agreement shall be forfeited and the corporation counsel, immediately upon notification by the commissioner of finance of such default, shall cause to be entered as to such property a supplemental judgment of foreclosure in the in rem action which authorizes the commissioner of finance to prepare, execute and cause to be recorded a deed conveying either to the city or to a third party full and complete title to such lands. Upon the entry of such supplemental judgment, the provisions of subdivisions c through i of this section shall apply in the same manner as such subdivisions would have applied had no payment been made nor installment agreement executed during the four-month period specified in this subdivision.

e. 1. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to a parcel of class one or class two real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, the city's interest in such parcel may be released pursuant to this subdivision on the application of any party who has an interest in said parcel as either owner, mortgagee, lienor, or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made at any time up to sixteen months from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said parcel was recorded.

   2. Any such application shall be made in writing to the commissioner of general services and shall be verified. It shall contain the information required pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of section 11-424 of this chapter, the documents required by subdivision c of such section, and shall be accompanied by the fees required by paragraphs three and six of subdivision b of such section. The fee required by paragraph three of subdivision b of section 11-424 of this chapter shall not be refundable.

   3. The city's interest in any such parcel shall be released only after payment of the sums of money specified in subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter.

   4. The provisions contained in subdivision g of section 11-424 of this chapter shall govern such an application, except as follows:

      (a) where such provisions are inconsistent with the provisions contained in this subdivision, the provisions contained in this subdivision shall govern such application; and

      (b) where the in rem foreclosure release board denies a written request for an installment agreement that was filed in connection with an application for release of the city's interest in a parcel of class one or class two real property and such application was filed within thirty days of the date of the city's acquisition of the property sought to be released, the board may, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to such applicant.

   5. Upon receipt of all the amounts required to be paid pursuant to this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax foreclosure action as to said property, canceling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and vacating and setting aside the final judgment entered pursuant to subdivision b of this section and the deed executed and recorded pursuant to such final judgment as to said property. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before the final judgment was entered, as if the in rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, management fees and liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in this subdivision, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.

f. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to be recorded a deed conveying to the city full and complete title to a parcel of class one or class two real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure and such parcel is entitled to an exemption under any of the provisions of article four of the real property tax law during all or part of the period covered by the tax items appearing on a list of delinquent taxes, the owner of such parcel may apply for a release of the city's interest in such exempt property under the provisions of subdivision e of this section during the period of time set forth in paragraph one of such subdivision and for an additional period up to ten years from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded. The application of such owner shall be accompanied by the nonrefundable fee required by paragraph four of subdivision b of section 11-424 of this chapter and shall contain, in addition to the statements, searches and proofs required by subdivision e of this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property tax law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such application, and during the period after the city's acquisition up to the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption and the exact nature and extent of such exemption or that an application for such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent the applicant is entitled to an exemption as set forth in the certificate. A release of the city's interest may be authorized only at the discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and, except as otherwise provided in paragraph four of subdivision e of this section, subject to all the restrictions set forth in subdivision g of section 11-424 of this chapter. A release to an exempt applicant shall be effected only after said applicant has paid all of the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter, except for those tax items which have been canceled, in whole or in part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within thirty days of the date on which the letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant.

g. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to be recorded a deed conveying to the city or to a third party full and complete title to a parcel of class one or class two real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, the provisions contained in subdivisions f and i of section 11-424 of this chapter for the release of property so acquired shall not be available. If the commissioner of finance has prepared, executed and caused to be recorded a deed conveying to a third party full and complete title to a parcel of class one or class two real property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, the provisions contained in subdivisions e and f of this section for the release of property so acquired shall not be available.

h. Every deed given pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be presumptive evidence that the action and all proceedings therein and all proceedings prior thereto from and including the assessment of the lands affected and all notices required by law were regular and in accordance with all provisions of law relating thereto. After four months from the date of entry of the final judgment authorizing the award of possession of any parcel of class one or class two real property pursuant to the provisions of this section, the presumption shall be conclusive. No action to set aside such deed may be maintained unless the action is commenced and a notice of pendency of the action is filed in the office of the property county clerk prior to the time that the presumption becomes conclusive as aforesaid. Should any lawsuit or proceeding be commenced to set aside a deed conveying to a third party a parcel of class one or class two real property pursuant to the provisions of this section, such third party shall send to the corporation counsel within ten days of their receipt a copy of any papers served on such third party in such lawsuit or proceeding.

i. If the commissioner of finance does not execute a deed conveying to the city or to a third party a parcel of class one or class two real property within eight months after the entry of final judgment authorizing the award of possession of such parcel pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the commissioner of finance shall direct the corporation counsel to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem foreclosure action as to said property, canceling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and vacating and setting aside said final judgment. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators and encumbrancers, to the status they held immediately before such final judgment was entered.

j. If the commissioner of finance directs the corporation counsel, pursuant to subdivision i of this section, to prepare and cause to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem foreclosure action with respect to a parcel of class one or class two real property determined to be distressed pursuant to section 11-401.1 of this chapter, the commissioner of housing preservation and development shall evaluate the parcel determined to be distressed and take such action as he or she deems appropriate under the programs, existing at the time of such evaluation, that are designed to encourage the rehabilitation and preservation of existing housing, and shall monitor or cause to be monitored the status of the property. The commissioner of housing preservation and development shall maintain a register of properties determined to be distressed.






*§ 11-412.2 Council review of conveyance to a third party.* ::


The commissioner of finance shall, prior to the execution of a deed conveying full and complete title of any parcel of class one or class two real property to a third party pursuant to subdivision c of section 11-412.1 of this chapter, notify the council of the proposed conveyance. Within forty-five days of such notification, the council may act by local law disapproving the proposed conveyance. In the event the council does not act by local law within such forty-five day period, the council shall be deemed to have approved the proposed conveyance. During such forty-five day period or, if the city council acts by local law pursuant to this section, during the period of time from the notification of the council to the presentation to the mayor of such local law and during any additional period of time prescribed in section 37 of the charter, the eight-month period provided in subdivisions c and i of section 11-412.1 of this chapter shall be tolled.






*§ 11-413 Withdrawal of parcels from foreclosure.* ::


a. The commissioner of finance may, prior to final judgment, withdraw a parcel from a proceeding under this chapter for any of the following reasons, (1) a question which the commissioner deems meritorious has been raised as to the validity of the tax liens affecting the parcel, (2) the city collector has accepted a payment of all taxes and interest which rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder because the records in the commissioner's office indicated that the principal amount of such taxes was exceeded by the principal amount of subsequent taxes which would not have rendered the parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder and which had been paid prior to the commencement of said proceeding or (3) in cases where the tax foreclosure action cannot be maintained such as, but not limited thereto, where the charges which rendered a parcel subject to foreclosure hereunder have been cancelled or were paid before the commencement of the foreclosure proceeding but such payment was not reported or did not clear for payment until after the commencement of said proceeding, or where a name and address appearing on an owner's registration card or an in rem card filed pursuant to section 11-416 or 11-417 of this chapter and contained in the files of the city collector did not appear in the mailing list used by the commissioner of finance for mailing notices of foreclosure in such proceeding.

b. To effectuate such withdrawal the commissioner of finance shall deliver a certificate of withdrawal to the corporation counsel who shall file it in the office of the county clerk in which the list of delinquent taxes was filed. The filing of such certificate with such county clerk shall effect a discontinuance of the tax foreclosure action as to the affected parcel, and the county clerk shall thereupon note such withdrawal and discontinuance in the copy of the list of delinquent taxes maintained by him or her adjacent to the county clerk's block index of notices of pendency of action and shall cancel and discharge any and all notations of the filing of said list of delinquent taxes as to said parcel that may appear in any other books, records, indices and dockets maintained in said clerk's office.

c. The commissioner of finance shall also deliver a duplicate original certificate of withdrawal to the person entitled to such withdrawal.

d. The commissioner of finance shall recite the parcels so withdrawn and the reasons for withdrawal in an affidavit of regularity to be submitted by the commissioner in each action brought pursuant to this chapter.

e. The commissioner of finance shall issue a certificate of withdrawal whenever taxes and interest are paid, cancelled, liquidated or otherwise lawfully disposed of as to any parcel which was previously severed pursuant to section 11-409 of this chapter because an answer or litigation was pending.






*§ 11-414 Right of redemption not diminished.* ::


The period of time in which any owner of, or other person having an interest in a parcel of property may redeem from a sale of a transfer of tax lien is not hereby diminished nor shall such period of time be diminished by the commencement of any action brought pursuant to this chapter.

b. The commissioner of finance shall mail bills for taxes, charges and assessments to all owners who have filed owner's registration cards as herein provided, but the failure of the commissioner of finance so to mail such bill shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the tax, charge or assessment represented thereby nor prevent the accruing of any interest or penalty imposed for the non-payment thereof, nor prevent or stay proceedings under this chapter, nor effect the title of the plaintiff or any purchaser under such proceedings.

c. The commissioner of finance shall also mail notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to all owners who have filed owner's registration cards whenever the parcels as to which such cards were filed are included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. The failure to receive such notice or process as herein provided shall not affect the validity of any action or proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.

d. An owner who files an owner's registration card may also designate thereon the full name and post office address of a mortgagee, lienor or other person to receive bills and notices. Where such designation is made, the commissioner of finance shall not mail any bills and notices to the owner but shall mail all bills and notices to the owner's designee.






*§ 11-417 In rem cards; mailing notices to other interested persons.* ::


a. The commissioner of finance shall, in addition to the file maintained by him or her pursuant to section 11-416 of this chapter, maintain a file of in rem cards submitted by any person having an interest in real property who is not entitled to have tax bills mailed to him or her by the commissioner of finance, including mortgagees, lienors, encumbrancers and owners who have filed owner's registration cards designating someone else to receive bills and notices. Each such in rem card shall be signed by the person filing such card or a duly authorized representative, shall contain a description of the premises by reference to the section, block and lot numbers on the tax map and shall state the date on which said card was filed, the full name and post office address of the person filing said card and the nature of the interest said person has in said premises.

b. The commissioner of finance shall mail a notice of foreclosure and any other process required by this chapter to each person who has filed an in rem card whenever the parcels to which such cards refer are included in a list of delinquent taxes filed pursuant to this chapter. However, failure to receive such notice or process shall not affect the validity of any proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter.






*§ 11-418 Writ of assistance.* ::


The city, after acquiring title to premises under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter, shall be entitled to a writ of assistance, with the same force and effect as if the city had acquired the property by virtue of a mortgage foreclosure.






*§ 11-419 Consolidation of actions.* ::


Actions or proceedings pending in the courts, or otherwise, to cancel a sale of a tax lien on lands a lien upon which is being foreclosed by action under this chapter, shall be terminated upon the institution of a foreclosure action pursuant to this chapter, and the rights and remedies of the parties in interest to such pending actions or proceedings shall be determined by the court in such foreclosure action.






*§ 11-420 Lands held for public use; right of sale.* ::


Whenever the city shall become vested with the title to lands by virtue of a foreclosure proceeding brought pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, such lands shall, unless actually used for other than municipal purposes, be deemed to be held by the city for a public use but for a period of not more than three years from the date of the final judgment. The city is hereby authorized to sell and convey such lands in the manner provided by law for the sale and conveyance of other real property held and owned by the city and not otherwise.






*§ 11-421 Certificate of sale as evidence.* ::


The transfer of tax lien or any other written instrument representing a tax lien shall be presumptive evidence in all courts in all proceedings under this chapter by and against the purchaser and his or her representatives, heirs and assigns, of the truth of the statements therein, of the title of the purchaser to the property therein described, and of the regularity and validity of all proceedings had in reference to the taxes, assessments or other legal charges for the nonpayment of which the tax lien was sold and the sale thereof. After two years from the issuance of such certificate or other written instrument, no evidence shall be admissible in any court in a proceeding under this chapter to rebut such presumption unless the holder thereof shall have procured such transfer of tax lien or such other written instrument by fraud or had previous knowledge that it was fraudulently made or procured.






*§ 11-422 Deed in lieu of foreclosure.* ::


The city may when authorized by resolution of the board of estimate and in lieu of prosecuting an action to foreclose a tax lien on any parcel pursuant to this chapter accept a conveyance of the interest of any person having any right, title, interest, claim, lien or equity of redemption in or to such parcel.

*§ 11-424 Application to the city for release of property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure.* ::


a. (1) The city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section on the application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made at any time up to two years from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded.

   (2) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph one of this subdivision to the contrary, the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure may be released pursuant to this section upon application of any party who had an interest in said property as either owner, mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer at the time of the city's acquisition thereof where such application is made more than two years after the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to said property was recorded provided such application is authorized by the council as hereinafter provided. An application for such release and the documents required by subdivision c in support thereof shall be filed with the department of citywide administrative services in the manner provided in subdivision b of this section. The department of citywide administrative services shall give the council written notice of the receipt of each such filing. After review and approval of the application by the corporation counsel as to form and eligibility of the applicant, the department of citywide administrative services shall send a copy of such application to the in rem foreclosure release board and to the council. Upon receipt of such application, the in rem foreclosure release board shall take no further action on such application unless the council adopts a resolution within one hundred twenty days following the first stated meeting of the council after receipt of such application authorizing the board to consider such application. If the council fails to adopt a resolution within such one-hundred-twenty-day period, the council shall be deemed to have denied its authorization for the board to consider such application. A resolution of the council pursuant to this paragraph shall describe the property for which release is sought by borough, tax map, block and lot number and shall specify that release of the city's interest in such property is subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board and to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in this section.

b. 1. Any such application shall be made in writing to the commissioner of citywide administrative services and shall be verified. It shall contain the name and address of the applicant and shall state the date on which and the in rem action by which the city acquired title to the property sought to be released. It shall also contain a statement specifying the nature of the applicant's interest in the property and a full description of the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives including the date of execution, the date and place of the recording or entry of said instrument and the parties thereto. In the event the applicant's interest arises by reason of the death of a prior owner, mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer, then the application shall also state the applicant's relationship to said decedent and shall include whatever additional information may be necessary to prove the applicant's right to make such application.

   2. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision f of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars.

   3. A fee of five hundred fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision g of this section, except that the fee for any such application for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars.

   4. A fee of two hundred seventy-five dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of subdivision h of this section within four months from the date on which the deed by which the city acquired title to the subject property was recorded, and a fee of five hundred and fifty dollars shall be paid on the submission of any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision not within four months from such date; except that the fee for any such application which is subject to the provisions of such subdivision for the release of property improved by a one or two-family dwelling shall be one hundred dollars.

   5. The fees payable pursuant to paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision shall not be refundable.

   6. In addition to the fees specified in paragraphs two, three and four of this subdivision, there shall be paid on the submission of any application which is subject to this section an amount at least equal to the lesser of nine hundred dollars or the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, which amount shall not be refundable, but shall be applied in reduction of the sum specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of this section; provided, however, that if a release requires the authorization of the in rem foreclosure release board, and such authorization is not given, such additional amount shall be refunded to the applicant.

c. Each application shall be supported by the certified search of the city register or by an official letter, certificate or certified search of any title insurance or abstract company, organized and doing business under the laws of this state. Such supporting instruments shall recite the recording data both as to the deed by which the city acquired title to the parcel sought to be released and the instrument from which the applicant's interest derives. In the event the applicant's interest does not appear of record but is derived by the death of an owner, mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer of record, then the application shall also be supported by the affidavit of the applicant or other person having information thereof, or by the duly written certificate or certification of the county clerk or the clerk of any surrogate's or other court of record, or by any other instrument or document required by the corporation counsel to substantiate the applicant's right to file such application in compliance with the provisions of this section.

d. The city's interest shall be released only after payment, as to each parcel to be released, of the following sums of money:

   1. The principal amount due on all unpaid taxes, assessments, water charges and sewer rents appearing on the list of delinquent taxes and accruing thereafter together with interest at the rate or rates provided by law.

   2. Five percent of the amount paid pursuant to the preceding paragraph but not exceeding one thousand dollars for each parcel.

   3. Any deficiency which may result to the city after all payments made by it for the repair, maintenance, and operation of the lands, real estate or real property shall have been charged or debited in the appropriate accounts of the city and all rents, license fees and other moneys collected by the city as a result of its operation of the said lands, real estate or real property shall have been credited in such accounts. Any contract for repair, maintenance, management or operation made by the city on which it shall be liable, although payment thereon shall not have been made, shall be deemed a charge or debit to such accounts as though payment had been made. The amounts paid and collected by the city as shown in its accounts and the necessity for making the several payments and contracts to be charged as herein provided shall be conclusive upon the applicant. Where a deficiency under this subdivision shall be created or increased by the failure of the city to collect rents, license fees or other moneys to which the city may have been entitled, the right to collect or to bring action for the same shall be assigned, transferred and set over to the applicant by an instrument in writing.

   4. Any and all costs and disbursements which shall have been awarded to the city or to which it may have become entitled by operation of law or which it may have paid or become liable for payment in connection with any litigation between it and the applicant or any person having an estate or interest in the lands, real estate or real property to be released resulting directly or indirectly from the foreclosure by action in rem of the delinquent taxes affecting said lands, real estate or real property.

   5. A reasonable monthly fee to be determined by the city, through the department of citywide administrative services, for management services and operations of the lands, real estate or real property by the city prior to the release of said lands, real estate or property.

   6. The city, through the department of citywide administrative services, shall also require as additional consideration for such release, the payment of all arrears on mortgages held by the city and all liens accruing to it by operation of law including but not limited to relocation and emergency repair liens.

e. The corporation counsel shall effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, as provided for in this section, by preparing and causing to be entered an order discontinuing the in rem tax forclosure action as to said property, cancelling the notice of pendency of such action as to said property and vacating and setting aside the in rem judgment of foreclosure and the deed executed and recorded pursuant to such judgment of foreclosure as to said property. The entry of such order shall restore all parties, including owners, mortgagees and any and all lienors, receivers and administrators and encumbrancers, to the status they held at the time the city acquired title to said property, as if the in rem tax foreclosure had never taken place, and shall render said property liable for all taxes, deficiencies, management fees and liens which shall accrue subsequent to those paid in order to obtain the release provided for in this section, or which were, for whatever reason, omitted from the payment made to obtain said release.

f. If an application pursuant to this section, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, are filed within four months after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, said application shall be granted providing the corporation counsel approves the application as to form, timeliness and eligibility of the applicant and providing the applicant has paid all amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The city shall not sell or assign any property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure within four months of said acquisition but this provision shall not prevent the city from authorizing condemnation of such property or vesting title thereto in a condemnation proceeding during said four month period. In the event an application pursuant to this section is filed within four months of the city's acquisition by in rem tax foreclosure and title to the subject property vests in condemnation before the city's interest therein has been released by the vacate order provided for herein, the applicant shall be entitled to the condemnation award for such property without the entry of such vacate order, providing the corporation counsel has approved the application as aforesaid and providing that the amounts specified in subdivision d of this section, if not previously paid, are deducted from said condemnation award, with taxes apportioned to the date of the condemnation title vesting.

g. If an application for a release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure, and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof, have been filed within the time allowed in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section, but more than four months after the date of the city's acquisition or if an application for such release has been authorized by a resolution of the council pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision a of this section and such application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof have been filed, the in rem foreclosure release board may, in its discretion, authorize the release of the city's interest in said property pursuant to this section, provided that the application has been approved by the corporation counsel as to form, timeliness and eligibility of the applicant and provided that the city has not sold or otherwise disposed of said property and provided, further, that said property has not been condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use for any capital or urban renewal project of the city. The corporation counsel shall effect such discretionary release only where the applicant, after the board's authorization of the release, has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting the applicant to make such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. The in rem foreclosure release board may also, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest in such property, pursuant to the above provisions, whenever an application for such release, approved as to form, timeliness and eligibility by the corporation counsel, has been filed at any time during the period allowed in subdivision a of this section in which the applicant has requested an installment agreement of the commissioner of citywide administrative services for the payment of the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, provided that said commissioner has approved such request. The commissioner of citywide administrative services shall not approve any such request unless the applicant shall have given notice by certified mail to each tenant located on the parcel, of the request and shall have given such commissioner an affidavit stating that such notice has been provided, within thirty days after the request. Any false statement in such affidavit shall not in any way affect the validity of the agreement, be grounds for its cancellation or in any way affect the release of the city's interest in the parcel. Such agreement shall require, in addition to full payment of the amounts due under paragraphs two, three, four, five and six of subdivision d of this section, a first installment of fifty percent of the amount due under paragraph one of said subdivision d with the balance of said amount to be paid in four equal quarterly installments together with all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges that accrue during such period; provided, however, that: (i) whenever a request for an installment agreement is made of the commissioner of citywide administrative services by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development or for a parcel which is an owner-occupied residential building of not more than five residential units, the commissioner of citywide administrative services may, as to that portion of the amounts due under paragraph one of subdivision d of this section which became due prior to the acquisition by the article XI company of its interest in the property and as to the amount due under paragraph one of subdivision d of this section in the case of such an owner-occupied building, approve a reduction of such first installment to an amount not less than ten percent of the amount due under paragraph one of subdivision d of this section and an increase in the number of the following equal quarterly installments to a number which shall be equal to three times the number of unpaid quarters of real estate taxes or the equivalent thereof but which shall in no event exceed forty-eight, and (ii) notwithstanding the preceding clause, whenever an installment agreement is requested on or after the date on which this clause takes effect with respect to a parcel that, immediately prior to the city's acquisition thereof by in rem tax foreclosure, was owned by a company organized pursuant to article XI of the state private housing finance law with the consent and approval of the department of housing preservation and development, or with respect to a parcel that is a residential building containing not more than five residential units, a residential condominium unit or a residential building held in a cooperative form of ownership, the commissioner of general services may, as to the amount due under paragraph one of subdivision d of this section, approve an installment agreement containing the terms relating to the required percentage payment for the first installment and the required number of subsequent quarterly installments, that would be applicable to such parcel under paragraph two (but without regard to any reference therein to paragraph three) of subdivision i of section 11-409 of this chapter. For purposes of calculating the number of such following equal quarterly installments, unpaid real estate taxes or the equivalent which are, on and after July first, nineteen hundred eighty-two, due and payable on an other than quarterly basis, shall be deemed to be payable on a quarterly basis. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting an installment agreement, the board shall authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant only when said application and the documents required by subdivision c of this section in support thereof were filed within thirty days of the date of the city's acquisition of the property sought to be released. Where the in rem foreclosure release board denies an application requesting an installment agreement which was filed more than thirty days after the date of the city's acquisition, the board may, in its discretion, authorize a release of the city's interest, provided that the applicant thereafter pays all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting such payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant. Where the in rem foreclosure release board approves an application requesting an installment agreement, the order releasing the city's interest shall provide that in the event of any default as to the payment of either quarterly installments or current taxes, assessments or other legal charges during the term of such agreement, as set forth in the board's resolution, all payments made under said agreement shall be forfeited and the city shall be entitled to reacquire the property so released. The corporation counsel shall effect such reacquisition by causing to be entered as to such property a supplemental judgment of foreclosure in the in rem action by which said property was originally acquired immediately on notification by the commissioner of finance of such default.

h. An owner of property entitled to an exemption under any of the provisions of article four of the real property tax law during all or part of the period covered by the tax items appearing on a list of delinquent taxes may apply for a release of the city's interest in such exempt property under the provisions of this section during the periods of time set forth herein and for an additional period up to ten years form the date of the city's acquisition of said property by in rem foreclosure. The application of such owner shall contain, in addition to the statements, searches and proofs required by this section, a statement that an exemption under the real property tax law is being claimed. Such application shall also state either that it is accompanied by the written certificate of the comptroller setting forth the precise period during which said property, while owned by such applicant, and during the period after the city's acquisition up to the date of the certificate if said property was still being used for an exempt purpose after said acquisition, was entitled to an exemption and the exact nature and extent of such exemption or that an application for such written certificate has been filed with the comptroller. On issuing such written certificate, the comptroller shall cancel those tax items which have accrued during the period covered by the certificate to the extent the applicant is entitled to an exemption as set forth in the certificate. Where an application by an exempt owner is filed more than four months after the date of the city's acquisition of the subject property, a release of the city's interest may be issued only at the discretion of the in rem foreclosure release board and subject to all the restrictions set forth in the preceding subdivision. A release to an exempt applicant shall be effected only after said applicant has paid all the amounts required to be paid by subdivision d of this section, except for those tax items which have been cancelled, in whole or in part, pursuant to the comptroller's certificate, within thirty days of the date on which a letter requesting payment is mailed or delivered to the applicant.

i. The corporation counsel shall also effect the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem foreclosure, as provided for in this action, whenever the commissioner of finance shall accept as to any parcel so acquired, the payment provided for in paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter. Said commissioner may accept such payment at any time within four months of the date of the city's acquisition and may further, subject to the approval of the in rem foreclosure release board, accept such payment at any time more than four months after the date of the city's acquisition but less than two years from the date on which the city's deed was recorded providing said property has not been sold or otherwise disposed of nor condemned or assigned to any agency of the city and is not the subject of contemplated use of any capital or urban renewal project of the city.






*§ 11-424.1 In rem foreclosure release board.* ::


There shall be an in rem foreclosure release board consisting of the mayor, the speaker of the city council, the affected borough president, the corporation counsel and the commissioner of finance. For the purposes of this section, the affected borough president shall be the president of the borough in which a property proposed for release pursuant to this section is located. Members of the board may, by written authority filed with the board and with the city clerk, appoint delegates to act on their behalf as members of the board. The board shall have the power, acting by resolution, to authorize the release of the city's interest in property acquired by in rem tax foreclosure in accordance with sections 11-412.1 and 11-424 of the code based upon a determination, in its discretion, that such release would be in the best interests of the city. The board shall act after a meeting at which the public has been provided an opportunity to comment on the proposed action. A resolution of the board authorizing a release of the city's interest in any property shall be adopted only upon the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of all the members of the board. The board may consider any information it deems relevant to a determination. The board shall not be required to state the reasons for its determination.






*§ 11-425 Agreements for payment of delinquent taxes and charges in installments.* ::


a. During the period beginning on May ninth, nineteen hundred seventy-seven and ending on June thirtieth, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, the commissioner of finance or, when so specified hereinafter, the commissioner of general services, shall be authorized and empowered to make and execute agreements in the circumstances and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the following subdivisions of this section; provided, however, that if the commissioner of finance or, where applicable, the commissioner of general services determines in his or her sole discretion that good cause exists, he or she may make and execute such agreements during an additional period ending not later than July thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven.

b. (1) Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel has been due and unpaid for a period of at least six months from the date on which the tax, assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into an agreement with the owner of such parcel or other person claiming to have an interest therein providing for the payment of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest and penalties in installments, the first of which shall be equal to at least fifteen percent of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement. Each remaining installment shall be equal to at least an amount produced by dividing the balance of such arrears by a factor determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by two hundred per cent. In no event, however, shall the factor referred to in the preceding sentence be in excess of thirty-two. Each such remaining installment shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.

   (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is executed prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough or portion of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent taxes, provided, at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid as they became due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default in the agreement or any failure to make timely payment of any current item, the parcel shall, if then delinquent for the applicable period specified in section 11-404 of this chapter, be eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.

   (3) If an in rem foreclosure action has been commenced against any parcel prior to May ninth, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, the commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into an agreement authorized and described in the foregoing provisions of this section with respect to such parcel. However, if such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time said agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made pursuant to this paragraph may, prior to final judgment, be withdrawn from the action, provided there has been no default in the agreement, and provided further that all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid when they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by the commissioner of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.

   (4) Any person who, prior to May ninth, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, has made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance an agreement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be permitted to make application to the commissioner of finance for the purpose of having such agreement cancelled and a new agreement executed as hereinabove provided. If an agreement executed prior to May ninth, nineteen hundred seventy-seven is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments due and payable under such agreement on or after July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven shall be subject to interest at the rate specified in paragraph five of this subdivision, but only if, as of July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid within the time allowed by law. Such rate of interest shall be calculated in the manner and shall be subject to all the conditions provided in said paragraph five.

   (5) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant to any of the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall, notwithstanding the rates of interest prescribed in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title, charge, collect and receive interest on the arrears due and payable under such agreement, to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum from July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven to the date of payment of each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title. The seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is no default in the agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise specified in this title.

   (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized by this section, the commissioner of finance may in his or her discretion include in such agreements such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this section, as he or she determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions of this section. The commissioner may also adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

c. (1) If, pursuant to the provisions of section 11-424 of this chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city through in rem tax foreclosure is made within the four-month period specified in subdivision f of section 11-424 of this chapter, and provided such application is made during the period specified in subdivision a of this section, the following paragraphs of this subdivision shall, at the election of the applicant, apply with respect to such application and the release sought thereby.

   (2) At the time of filing the application for release, an applicant who elects to have the provisions of this subdivision apply to him or her, shall pay to the city the amounts specified in paragraphs two, three and four of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter, for this purpose, the amount specified in paragraph two thereof shall be deemed to be the amount which would have been required to be paid thereunder had this section not been in effect.

*§ 11-426 Agreements for payment of delinquent taxes and charges in installments.* ::


a. During the period beginning on December second, nineteen hundred seventy-seven and ending on March thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, the commissioner of finance, or, when so specified hereinafter, the commissioner of general services, shall be authorized and empowered to make and execute agreements in the circumstances and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the following subdivisions of this section.

b. (1) Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel has been due and unpaid for a period of at least six months from the date on which the tax, assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into an agreement with the owner of such parcel or other person claiming to have an interest therein providing for the payment of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest and penalties in installments, the first of which shall be equal to at least fifteen percent of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement. Each remaining installment shall be equal to at least an amount produced by dividing the balance of such arrears by a factor determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by two hundred percent. In no event, however, shall the factor referred to in the preceding sentence be in excess of thirty-two. Each such remaining installment shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.

   (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is executed prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough or portion of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent taxes, provided, at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid as they became due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default in the agreement or any failure to make timely payment of any current item, the parcel shall, if then delinquent for the applicable period specified in section 11-404 of this chapter, be eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.

   (3) If an in rem foreclosure action has been commenced against any parcel prior to December second, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, the commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into an agreement authorized and described in the foregoing provisions of this section with respect to such parcel. However, if such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time said agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made pursuant to this paragraph may, prior to final judgment, be withdrawn from the action, provided there has been no default in the agreement, and provided further that all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid when they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by the commissioner of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.

   (4) Any person who, prior to December second, nineteen hundred seventy-seven, has made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance an agreement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be permitted to make application to the commissioner of finance for the purpose of having such agreement cancelled and a new agreement executed as hereinabove provided. If an agreement executed prior to December second, nineteen hundred seventy-seven is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments due and payable under such agreement on or after April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight shall be subject to interest at the rate specified in paragraph five of this subdivision, but only if, as of April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid within the time allowed by law. Such rate of interest shall be calculated in the manner and shall be subject to all the conditions provided in said paragraph five.

   (5) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant to any of the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall, notwithstanding the rates of interest prescribed in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title, charge, collect and receive interest on the arrears due and payable under such agreement to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum from April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight to the date of payment of each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title. The seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is no default in the agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise specified in this title.

   (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized by this section, the commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, include in such agreements such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this section, as such commissioner determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions of this section. The commissioner of finance may also adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

c. (1) If, pursuant to the provisions of section 11-424 of this chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city through in rem tax foreclosure is made within the four-month period specified in subdivision f of section 11-424 of this chapter, and provided such application is made during the period specified in subdivision a of this section, the following paragraphs of this subdivision shall, at the election of the applicant, apply with respect to such application and the release sought thereby.

   (2) At the time of filing the application for release, an applicant who elects to have the provisions of this subdivision apply to him or her, shall pay to the city the amounts specified in paragraphs two, three and four of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter, for this purpose, the amount specified in paragraph two thereof shall be deemed to be the amount which would have been required to be paid thereunder had this section not been in effect. Concurrent with the making of such payment, the applicant shall enter into an agreement with the commissioner of general services providing for the payment of all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges on the property as they become due or within the grace period provided by law, and, in addition, providing for the payment of the amount specified in paragraph one of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter in installments, the first of which shall be equal to at least twenty-five percent of such amount and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement. The balance of such amount shall be payable in twelve equal quarterly installments, each of which shall be paid quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.

   (3) Pending approval by the corporation counsel of an application for release as to form, timeliness and eligibility of the applicant, all payments made pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be held in escrow; in the event the corporation counsel disapproves the application, such payments shall be returned to the applicant, and the agreement executed by him or her shall thereupon be cancelled.

   (4) In the case of any agreement made and executed pursuant to paragraph two thereof, interest on any installment due and payable thereunder shall, notwithstanding the rates of interest prescribed in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title, be charged, collected and received at the rate of seven percent per annum from April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight to the date of payment of each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to April first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title. The seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is no default in the agreement entered into as provided in this subdivision, and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law.

   (5) No release for which application has been made pursuant to this subdivision shall be granted until the final payment under the agreement herein provided is received by the city. Upon receipt of such final payment by the city the corporation counsel shall effect the release in the manner provided in section 11-424 of this chapter. In the event of any default in an agreement executed as provided in this subdivision or any failure to pay current taxes, assessments or other legal charges as they become due or within the grace period provided by law, such agreement shall thereupon become void, the release process shall be terminated, and all payments theretofore made shall be forfeited to the city.

   (6) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized thereby, the commissioner of general services may, in his or her discretion, include in such agreements such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this subdivision, as the commissioner determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions hereof. The commissioner of general services may also adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision.






*§ 11-427 Agreements for payment of delinquent taxes and charges in installments.* ::


a. During the period beginning September first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight and ending December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, the commissioner of finance, or, when so specified hereinafter, the commissioner of general services, shall be authorized and empowered to make and execute agreements in the circumstances and subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in the following subdivisions of this section; provided, however, that if the commissioner of finance or, where applicable, the commissioner of general services, determines in his or her sole discretion that good cause exists, he or she may make and execute such agreements during an additional period ending not later than January thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine.

b. (1) Whenever it shall appear that a tax lien on a parcel has been due and unpaid for a period of at least six months from the date on which the tax, assessment or other legal charge represented thereby became a lien, the commissioner of finance may enter into an agreement with the owner of such parcel or other person claiming to have an interest therein providing for the payment of such delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest and penalties in installments, the first of which shall be equal to at least fifteen percent of such arrears and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement. Each remaining installment shall be equal to at least an amount produced by dividing the balance of such arrears by a factor determined by multiplying the number of quarters of such arrears by two. In no event, however, shall the factor referred to in the preceding sentence be in excess of thirty-two. Each such remaining installment shall be payable quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.

   (2) If an agreement authorized by the preceding paragraph is executed prior to the time the commissioner of finance files in the office of the appropriate county clerk a list of delinquent taxes covering the borough or portion of the borough in which the subject parcel is located, such parcel shall be excluded from such list of delinquent taxes, provided, at the time such list is filed, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges were paid as they became due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default in the agreement or any failure to make timely payment of any current item, the parcel shall, if then delinquent for the applicable period specified in section 11-404 of this chapter, be eligible for inclusion in any list of delinquent taxes thereafter filed.

   (3) If an in rem foreclosure action has been commenced against any parcel prior to September first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, the commissioner of finance may, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, enter into an agreement authorized and described in the foregoing provisions of this section with respect to such parcel. However, if such an agreement is entered into subsequent to the last date for redemption specified in subdivision a of section 11-407 of this chapter, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time said agreement is executed an amount equal to the penalty which would have been payable under subdivision c of section 11-407 of this chapter had the person executing the agreement made a late redemption payment. Such amount shall be in addition to any installment payments required to be made under the agreement and shall not be credited against any such installment payments. Any parcel which is the subject of an agreement made pursuant to this paragraph may, prior to final judgment, be withdrawn from the action, provided there has been no default in the agreement, and provided further that all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid when they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. Such withdrawal shall be effected by the commissioner of finance in the manner provided in section 11-413 of this chapter.

   (4) Any person who, prior to September first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight, has made, executed and filed with the commissioner of finance an agreement pursuant to the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 11-413 of this chapter, shall be permitted to make application to the commissioner of finance for the purpose of having such agreement cancelled and a new agreement executed as hereinabove provided. If an agreement executed prior to September first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight is not cancelled as herein provided, any installments due and payable under such agreement on or after February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine shall be subject to interest at the rate specified in paragraph six of this subdivision, but only if, as of February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid within the time allowed by law. Such rate of interest shall be calculated in the manner and shall be subject to all the conditions provided in said paragraph six.

   (5) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, no owner of, or other person claiming to have an interest in, any parcel shall be eligible to enter into an agreement authorized by such paragraphs where such parcel was included in an in rem foreclosure action but was severed therefrom pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure in such action because an answer was still pending as to such parcel. The commissioner of finance may, however, on notice to the corporation counsel, enter into an agreement with such owner or other interested person providing for the payment of all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges on the parcel as they become due or within the grace period provided by law, and, in addition, providing for payment of the amount of all delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest due as of the date the agreement is executed in installments, the first of which shall be equal to at least twenty-five percent of such amount and shall be payable upon the execution of such agreement, and the balance of which shall be payable in twelve equal quarterly installments, each of which shall be paid on the first days of July, October, January and April. In addition, there shall be paid to the commissioner of finance at the time such agreement is executed a penalty equal to five percent of the amount of the delinquent taxes, assessments or other legal charges and interest due as of the date of the agreement, which penalty shall not exceed five hundred dollars. Any installments due and payable on or after February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine under an agreement described in this paragraph shall be subject to interest at the rate specified in paragraph six of this subdivision, but only if, as of February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine, there is no default in the agreement and all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges have been paid within the time allowed by law. Such rate of interest shall be calculated in the manner and shall be subject to all the conditions provided in said paragraph six. Upon receipt of the final payment due under an agreement executed pursuant to this paragraph, the commissioner of finance shall discontinue the in rem action pending with respect to the parcel which is the subject of such agreement, and shall cancel the lis pendens pertaining thereto by issuing a certificate of withdrawal pursuant to section 11-413 of this chapter. In the event of any default in such agreement or any failure to pay current taxes, assessments or other legal charges as they become due or within the grace period provided by law, such agreement and the answer which was the basis for the severance of the subject parcel from the in rem action shall both be deemed null and void and the city shall be entitled to acquire title to such parcel by entry of an appropriate supplemental judgment of foreclosure in such in rem action without further notice to the answering party.

   (6) When an agreement has been entered into pursuant to any of the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision, the commissioner of finance shall, notwithstanding the rates of interest prescribed in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title, charge, collect and receive interest on the arrears due and payable under such agreement, to be calculated at the rate of seven percent per annum from February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine to the date of payment of each installment. Any interest accrued or accruing prior to February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine shall not be affected by the provisions of this paragraph, but shall be charged, collected and received in the manner and at the rates specified in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title. The seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall be applicable only if (i) there is no default in the agreement entered into as provided in this section, and (ii) all current taxes, assessments or other legal charges are paid as they become due or within the period of grace provided by law. In the event of any default or failure to make timely payment of any current item, the seven percent rate of interest specified in this paragraph shall thereupon cease to be applicable and the commissioner of finance shall thereafter charge, collect and receive interest in the manner and at the rates otherwise specified in this chapter.

   (7) In addition to the terms and conditions required by the preceding paragraphs of this subdivision to be included in agreements authorized by this section, the commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, include in such agreements such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with this section, as the commissioner determines to be necessary in order to properly carry out the provisions of this section.

c. (1) If, pursuant to the provisions of section 11-424 of this chapter, an application for the release of property acquired by the city through in rem tax foreclosure has been filed within the four-month period specified in subdivision f of that section, and the sixty-day period for payment referred to in that subdivision has not expired prior to the commencement of the period specified in subdivision a of this section, the following paragraphs of this subdivision shall, at the election of the applicant, apply with respect to such application and the release sought thereby, provided notice of such election is given to the commissioner of general services during the period specified in subdivision a of this section, but in no event later than the last day of the sixty-day period referred to in subdivision f of section 11-424 of this chapter.

   (2) An applicant who elects to have the provisions of this subdivision apply to him or her, shall, at the time such applicant notifies the commissioner of general services of his or her election, pay to the city the amounts specified in paragraphs two, three and four of subdivision d of section 11-424 of this chapter; for this purpose, the amount specified in paragraph two thereof shall be deemed to be the amount which would have been required to be paid thereunder had this section not been in effect.

The balance of such amount shall be payable in twelve equal quarterly installments, each of which shall be paid quarterly on the first days of July, October, January and April.

   (3) Pending approval by the corporation counsel of an application for release as to form, timeliness and eligibility of the applicant, all payments made pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be held in escrow; in the event the corporation counsel disapproves the application, such payments shall be returned to the applicant, and the agreement executed by him or her shall thereupon be cancelled.

   (4) In the case of any agreement made and executed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, interest on any installment due and payable thereunder shall, notwithstanding the rates of interest prescribed in section 11-224, 11-312 or 11-313 of this title, be charged, collected and received at the rate of seven percent per annum from February first, nineteen hundred seventy-nine to the date of payment of each installment.

In case it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that the use of gross value in determining whether the requirements of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph are met, improperly or inaccurately reflects the taxpayer's primary activities, the commissioner of finance is authorized in his or her discretion and in such manner as he or she may determine, to reduce the gross value of the taxpayer's assets by liabilities attributable thereto or to eliminate assets, so as to properly and accurately reflect the taxpayer's primary activities.

For purposes of this subdivision, the conduct by such owner, lessee or fiduciary, at such real property, of a trade, business, profession or occupation, including, but not limited to, a garage, restaurant, laundry or health club, shall be deemed to be an incident to the holding, leasing or managing of such real property, and shall not be deemed the conduct of an unincorporated business, if such trade, business, profession or occupation is conducted solely for the benefit of tenants at such real property, as an incidental service to such tenants, and is not open or available to the general public, provided, however, if any such owner, lessee or fiduciary operates a garage, parking lot or other similar facility at such real property that is open or available to the general public, the provision by any such owner, lessee or fiduciary of the service of parking, garaging or storing of motor vehicles on a monthly or longer term basis shall be deemed to be an incident to the holding, leasing or managing of such real property, and shall not be deemed the conduct of an unincorporated business if, and only to the extent that, such monthly or longer term parking, garaging or storing service is provided to tenants at such real property as an incidental service to such tenants. If an owner, lessee or fiduciary holding, leasing or managing real property operates at such real property a garage, parking lot or other similar facility that is open or available to the public, each such owner, lessee or fiduciary shall file, together with and as a party of the returns required under section 11-514 of this chapter, a report or schedule for each such garage, parking lot or other similar facility, or in the discretion of the commissioner, make a separate entry on such returns, identifying the specific location and address, license number and licensed capacity of each such garage, parking lot or other similar facility, and shall include such additional information, data and other matters relating to the provision of such monthly or longer term parking, garaging or storing service to tenants as shall be prescribed by the commissioner of finance.

(e) Sales representative. An individual, other than one who maintains an office or who employs one or more assistants or who otherwise regularly carries on a business, shall not be deemed engaged in an unincorporated business solely by reason of selling goods, wares, merchandise or insurance for more than one enterprise. For purposes of this subdivision, space utilized solely for the display of merchandise and/or for the maintenance and storage of records normally used in the course of business shall not be deemed an office, and the employment of clerical and secretarial assistance shall not be deemed the employment of assistants.

(f) Exempt trusts and organizations. A trust or other unincorporated organization which by reason of its purposes or activities is exempt from federal income tax shall not be deemed an unincorporated business (regardless of whether subject to federal income tax on unrelated business taxable income).

The industrial and commercial incentive board in approving and certifying to the qualifications of the taxpayer to receive the tax credit provided for herein shall first determine that the applicant has met the requirements of this section, and further, that the granting of the tax credit to the applicant is in the "public interest." In determining that the granting of the tax credit is in the public interest, the board shall make affirmative findings that: the granting of the tax credit to the applicant will not effect an undue hardship on similar taxpayers already located within the city; the existence of this tax incentive has been instrumental in bringing about the relocation of the applicant to the city; and the granting of the tax credit will foster the economic recovery and economic development of the city.

   (2) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the first taxable year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for any of the twelve succeeding taxable years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises; provided that the credit allowed for the twelfth succeeding taxable year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to such premises in the twelfth succeeding taxable year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is such number of days in the taxable year of relocation less the number of days the eligible business maintained employment shares in the eligible premises in the taxable year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding taxable year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. Except as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent not previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such years.

(j) (1)  If a partner in an unincorporated business is taxable under this chapter and is required to include in unincorporated business taxable income his, her or its distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, or guaranteed payments from, such unincorporated business, such partner shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter equal to the lesser of the amounts determined in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph:

      (A) The amount determined in this subparagraph is the product of (i) the sum of (I) the tax imposed by this chapter on the unincorporated business for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner and paid by the unincorporated business and (II) the amount of any credit or credits taken by the unincorporated business under this section (except the credit allowed by subdivision (b) or this section) for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner, to the extent that such credits do not reduce such unincorporated business's tax below zero, and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the net total of the partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business for such taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such taxable year, of the net total distributive shares of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments to, all partners in the unincorporated business for whom or which such net total (as separately determined for each partner) is greater than zero.

      (B) The amount determined in this subparagraph is the difference between (i) the tax computed pursuant to this chapter on the unincorporated business taxable income of the partner, without allowance of any credits allowed by this section, and (ii) the tax so computed, determined as if the partner had no such distributive share or guaranteed payments with respect to the unincorporated business, provided, however, that the amounts computed in clauses (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph shall be computed with the following modifications:

         (I) such amounts shall be computed without taking into account any carryforward or carryback by the partner of a net operating loss;

         (II) if, prior to taking into account any distributive share or guaranteed payments from any unincorporated business or any net operating loss carryforward or carryback, the unincorporated business taxable income of the partner is less than zero, such unincorporated business taxable income shall be treated as zero; and

         (III) if such partner's net total distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from, any unincorporated business is less than zero, such net total shall be treated as zero. The amount determined in this subparagraph shall not be less than zero.

   (2) (A)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in paragraph one of this subdivision, the credit or the sum of the credits that may be taken by a partner for a taxable year under this subdivision with respect to an unincorporated business or unincorporated businesses in which he, she or it is a partner shall not exceed the tax imposed on the unincorporated business taxable income of such partner under this chapter for such taxable year reduced by the credit allowed under subdivision (b) of this section. If the credit allowed under paragraph one of this subdivision or the sum of such credits exceeds such tax as so reduced, the amount of the excess may be carried forward, in order, to each of the seven immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent not previously taken, shall be allowed as a credit in each of such years. In applying the provisions of the preceding sentence, the credit determined for the taxable year under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be taken before taking any credit carryforward pursuant to this paragraph and the credit carryforward attributable to the earliest taxable year shall be taken before taking a credit carryforward attributable to a subsequent taxable year.

      (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, in the case of a partner which is a partnership, no credit carryforward to any taxable year shall be allowed unless one or more of the partners therein during such taxable year where persons having a proportionate interest or interests, amounting to at least eighty percent of all such interests, in the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions of the partnership which was allowed the credit for which a carryforward is claimed. In such event, the carryforward allowable on account of such credit shall not exceed the percentage of the amount otherwise allowable, determined by dividing (i) the sum of the proportionate interests in the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions of the partnership, for the year to which the credit is carried forward, attributable to such partners, by (ii) the sum of such proportionate interests owned by all partners for such taxable year. The amount by which the carryforward otherwise allowable exceeds the amount allowable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be a carryforward to any other taxable year.

   (3) The credit allowed under this subdivision shall not be allowed to a partner in an unincorporated business with respect to any tax paid by the unincorporated business under this chapter for any taxable year beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-four.

   (4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the credit allowable under this subdivision shall be taken after the credit allowed by subdivision (b) of this section is taken, but before any other credit allowed by this section is taken.

   (5) The commissioner of finance of the city of New York shall convene a working group, consisting of representatives of the department of finance of the city of New York and representatives of affected industries, and other persons the commissioner deems appropriate, to study the treatment under the unincorporated business tax of income from investment and real estate activities and the impact of the credit permitted by this subdivision, including but not limited to cases where interests in a taxpayer are held by another taxpayer subject to tax on unincorporated business taxable income and the first taxpayer is entitled to claim a deduction for a net operating loss carryover and the second is not entitled to a corresponding deduction with the result, in certain cases, that the net income allocated to the second taxpayer may be subject to an effective rate of tax in excess of the rate imposed by this chapter. In addition, the working group shall also study the tax treatment of parking garages which are open or available to the general public and which also provide available space to tenants. In conducting such study, such working group shall take into account such factors as economic development, tax administration and other goals of tax policy and shall consider alternatives that would reduce disincentives for investing in corporations and other entities engaged in business in the city of New York, such as exempting income from investment activities from the tax on unincorporated business taxable income. The commissioner shall prepare a report based on the deliberations of the working group on or before April fifteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-five.

(k) Credit relating to certain sales and compensating use taxes on certain services.

   (1) In addition to any other credit allowed by this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter to be credited or refunded in the manner hereinafter provided in this subdivision. The amount of such credit shall be equal to the amount of sales and compensating use taxes imposed by section eleven hundred seven of the tax law during the taxpayer's taxable year (and the amount of any interest imposed in connection therewith) which was paid after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, less any credit or refund of such taxes (or such interest), with respect to the purchase or use by the taxpayer of the services described in subdivision (b) of section eleven hundred five-b of the tax law.

   (2) The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year shall be deemed to be an overpayment of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-526 of this chapter.

   (3) Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax imposed under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law (or of any interest imposed in connection therewith) for which the taxpayer had claimed a credit under this subdivision in a prior taxable year, the amount of such tax (or such interest) refund or credit shall be added to the tax imposed by this chapter, and such amount shall be subtracted in computing unincorporated business taxable income for the taxable year.

   (3) Except as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any taxable year exceeds the tax imposed for such year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the five immediately succeeding taxable years and, to the extent not previously deductible, may be deducted from the taxpayer's tax for such years.

   (4) The credits allowed under this subdivision, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year of the relocation and for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the taxable year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-526 of this chapter. For such taxable years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding taxable year.

      (2) For the purposes of this subdivision, "base year employment" means the average number of individuals employed full-time by the taxpayer in the city in the year preceding the first calendar year that ends with or within the taxable year for which the credit is claimed.

      (3) For the purposes of this subdivision, average number of individuals employed full-time shall be computed by adding the number of such individuals employed by the taxpayer at the end of each quarter during each calendar year or other applicable period and dividing the sum so obtained by the number of such quarters occurring within such calendar year or other applicable period.

      (4) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, the credit provided by this subdivision shall be allowed against the taxes authorized by this chapter for the taxable year after reduction by all other credits permitted by this chapter.

(p) Beer production credit.

   (1) A taxpayer subject to tax under this chapter, that is registered as a distributor under article eighteen of the tax law, and that produces sixty million or fewer gallons of beer in this state in the taxable year, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter in the amount specified in paragraph two of this subdivision. Provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for any beer produced in excess of fifteen million five hundred thousand gallons in the taxable year. Notwithstanding anything in this title to the contrary, if a partnership is allowed a credit under this subdivision, a taxpayer that is a partner in such partnership shall not be allowed a credit under this subdivision for any taxable year that includes the last day of the taxable year for which the partnership is allowed such credit.

   (2) The amount of the credit per taxpayer per taxable year for each gallon of beer produced in the city of New York on or after January first, two thousand seventeen shall be determined as follows:

      (i) for the first five hundred thousand gallons of beer produced in the city of New York in the taxable year, the credit shall equal twelve cents per gallon; and

      (ii) for each gallon of beer produced in the city of New York in the taxable year in excess of five hundred thousand gallons, the credit shall equal three and eighty-six one hundredths cents per gallon. The credit allowed under this subdivision for any taxable year shall be treated as an overpayment of tax to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-526 of this chapter; provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-528 of this chapter, no interest shall be paid thereon.








*§ 11-504 Taxable years to which tax applies; tax for taxable years beginning prior to and ending after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.* ::


(a) General. The tax imposed by section 11-503 of this chapter, with any modification permitted by subdivision (b) of this section, is imposed for each taxable year beginning with taxable years ending on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.

(b) Alternate methods for determining tax for taxable years ending on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six. 

   (1) The tax for any taxable year ending on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be an amount equal to the tax which would have been imposed had section 11-503 of this chapter been in effect for the entire taxable year, multiplied by the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year which occur after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five and divided by the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year.

   (2) In lieu of the method of computation of tax prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision, if the taxpayer maintained adequate records for the portion of any taxable year ending on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, which falls within the calendar year nineteen hundred sixty-six, the tax for such taxable year at the election of the taxpayer may be computed on the basis of the unincorporated business taxable income which the taxpayer would have reported had he or she filed a federal income tax return for a taxable year beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and ending with the close of such taxable year ending before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six. Such taxable year beginning January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and ending before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six shall be deemed (unless clearly indicated otherwise) to be the taxable year of the taxpayer. For purposes of this paragraph, the unincorporated business exemptions allowable under section 11-510 of this chapter, the credit allowable under subdivision (b) of section 11-503 of this chapter and any net operating loss deduction as modified pursuant to subdivision two of section 11-507 of this chapter shall each be reduced by the same part of such exemptions, credit, or net operating loss deduction (as the case may be) as the number of months (or major portions thereof) in the taxable year occurring before January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six is of the number of months (or major portions thereof) in such taxable year. Except as provided in paragraph two, the tax for such period ending before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be computed in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter.






*§ 11-505 Unincorporated business taxable income.* ::


The unincorporated business taxable income of an unincorporated business shall be the excess of its unincorporated business gross income over its unincorporated business deductions, allocated to the city, less the amount of:

(1) Its deductions under section 11-509 of this chapter not subject to allocation; and

(2) Its unincorporated business exemptions under section 11-510 of this chapter.

      (a) the amount of gain included in federal gross income with respect to each such property, and

      (b) the amount of gain (if smaller than the amount described in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph) that would be included in federal gross income with respect to each such property if the federal adjusted basis of such property on the date of the sale or other disposition had been equal to its fair market value on January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, or the date of its sale or other disposition prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, plus or minus all adjustments to basis made with respect to such property for federal income tax purposes for periods on and after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six; provided, however, that the total modification provided by this subparagraph shall not exceed the taxpayer's net gain from the sale or other disposition of all such property.

(e) Related members expense add back.

   (1) Definitions.

      (A) Related member. "Related member" means a related person as defined in subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code, except that "fifty percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".

      (B) Effective rate of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by the city on or measured by a related member's net income multiplied by the apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under the laws of said jurisdiction. For purposes of this definition, the effective rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's net income tax liability in said city is reported on a combined or consolidated return including both the taxpayer and the related member where the reported transactions between the taxpayer and the related member are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition, when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which a related member's net income is eliminated or offset by a credit or similar adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either maintaining or managing intangible property or collecting interest income in that city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said city shall be decreased to reflect the statutory rate of tax that applies to the related member as effectively reduced by such credit or similar adjustment.

      (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected to the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade names, trade dress, service marks, mask works, trade secrets, patents and any other similar types of intangible assets as determined by the commissioner of finance, and include amounts allowable as interest deductions under section one hundred sixty-three of the internal revenue code to the extent such amounts are directly or indirectly for, related to or in connection with the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of such intangible assets.

      (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is one or more business purposes, other than the avoidance or reduction of taxation, which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into new business markets.

   (2) Royalty expense add backs. 

      (A) For the purpose of computing unincorporated business entire net income, a taxpayer must add back royalty payments directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members during the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating federal taxable income.

      (B) Exceptions. 

         (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply to the portion of the royalty payment that the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, meets all of the following requirements:

            (I) the related member was subject to tax in this city or another city within the United States or a foreign nation or some combination thereof on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer;

            (II) the related member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related member; and

            (III) the transaction giving rise to the royalty payment between the taxpayer and the related member was undertaken for a valid business purpose.

         (ii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that:

            (I) the related member was subject to tax on or measured by its net income in this city or another city within the United States, or some combination thereof;

            (II) the tax base for said tax included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; and

            (III) the aggregate effective rate of tax applied to the related member in those jurisdictions is no less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-503 of this chapter for the taxable year.

         (iii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that:

            (I) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred to a related member organized under the laws of a country other than the United States;

            (II) the related member's income from the transaction was subject to a comprehensive income tax treaty between such country and the United States;

            (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer;

            (IV) the related member's income from the transaction was taxed in such country at an effective rate of tax at least equal to that imposed by this city; and

            (V) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred pursuant to a transaction that was undertaken for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an arm's length relationship.

         (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance agree in writing to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, agree to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the income of the taxpayer would not be properly reflected.

(f) Upon the disposition of property to which subdivisions twenty-three and twenty-four of section 11-507 of this chapter apply, the amount of any gain or loss includible in unincorporated business gross income shall be adjusted to reflect the modifications provided in such subdivisions attributable to such property.








*§ 11-507 Unincorporated business deductions.* ::


The unincorporated business deductions of an unincorporated business means the items of loss and deduction directly connected with or incurred in the conduct of the business, which are allowable for federal income tax purposes for the taxable year (including losses and deductions connected with any property employed in the business), with the following modifications:

(1) A deduction shall be allowed for charitable contributions of the unincorporated business, to the extent that such contributions would be deductible for federal income tax purposes if made by a corporation, but not in excess of five per centum of the amount by which the unincorporated business gross income exceeds the sum of (A) the unincorporated business deductions computed without the benefit of any deduction for charitable contributions and (B) the deduction allowed under subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter, where the election permitted by such subsection has been exercised.

(2) (a)    A deduction shall be allowed for net operating losses incurred by the unincorporated business, except as otherwise provided by paragraph (b) of this subdivision, in an amount computed in the same manner as the net operating loss deduction which would be allowed for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes if the unincorporated business were an individual taxpayer (but determined solely by reference to the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions, allocated to the city, of the unincorporated business); provided, however, that such net operating loss deduction which would be allowed for the taxable year for federal income tax purposes shall for purposes of this paragraph be determined as if the unincorporated business had elected under section one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue code to relinquish the entire carryback period with respect to net operating losses, except with respect to the first ten thousand dollars of each of such losses, sustained during taxable years ending after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. Such deduction shall not include any net operating loss sustained during any taxable year beginning prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and for the purposes of this paragraph a net operating loss shall be determined without regard to any deductions allowed pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter and any net operating loss for a taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-one shall be computed without regard to the deduction allowed with respect to recovery property under section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code; in lieu of such deduction, a taxpayer shall be allowed for such taxable year with respect to such property the depreciation deduction allowable under section one hundred sixty-seven of such internal revenue code as such section was in full force and effect on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty.

   (b) In the case of a partnership, no net operating loss carryback or carryover to any taxable year shall be allowed unless one or more of the partners during such taxable year were persons having a proportionate interest or interests, amounting to at least eighty percent of all such interests, in the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions of the partnership which sustained the loss for which a carryback or carryover is claimed. In such event, the carryback or carryover allowable on account of such loss shall not exceed the percentage of the amount otherwise allowable, determined by dividing (A) the sum of the proportionate interests in the unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions of the partnership, for the year to which the loss is carried back or carried over, attributable to such partners, by (B) the sum of such proportionate interests owned by all partners for such taxable year. The amount by which the carryback or carryover otherwise allowable exceeds the amount allowable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be a carryback or carryover to any other taxable year.

   (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, for taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand twenty-one, any amendment to section one hundred seventy-two of the internal revenue code made after March first, two thousand twenty shall not apply to this chapter.

(3) No deduction shall be allowed (except as provided in section 11509 of this chapter) for amounts paid or incurred to a proprietor or partner for services or for use of capital.

(4) No deduction shall be allowed for income taxes imposed by the city, this state or any other taxing jurisdiction, or the tax imposed by article thirteen-A of the tax law.

(5) No deduction shall be allowed for (A) interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities the interest on which is exempt from tax under this chapter; (B) expenses paid or incurred for the production or collection of such income or the management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of such income; or (C) the amortizable bond premium on any bond the interest income from which is so exempt.

(6) No deduction shall be allowed in respect of the excess of net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss, but capital losses incurred in the unincorporated business shall be treated as ordinary losses and shall be allowed in full.

(7) In the case of a taxpayer who has exercised the election permitted by subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter, no deduction shall be allowed for expenditures with reference to the property to which such election relates, or for depreciation of such property, except as permitted by said subdivision.

(8) A deduction shall be allowed (to the extent not allowable for federal income tax purposes) for (A) interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities the interest on which is subject to tax under this chapter but exempt from federal income tax; (B) ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for the production or collection of such income or the management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of such income; and (C) the amortizable bond premium for the taxable year on any bond the interest on which is subject to tax under this chapter but exempt from federal income tax.

(9) At the election of the taxpayer, a deduction shall be allowed for expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of industrial waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities.

   (A) (i)    The term "industrial waste treatment facilities" shall mean facilities for the treatment, neutralization or stabilization of industrial waste (as the term "industrial waste" is defined in section 17-0105 of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately preceding the point of such treatment, neutralization or stabilization to the point of disposal, including the necessary pumping and transmitting facilities, but excluding such facilities installed for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable.

      (ii) The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities which remove, reduce, or render less noxious air contaminants emitted from an air contamination source (as the terms "air contaminant" and "air contamination source" are defined in section 19-0107 of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately preceding the point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of discharge of air, meeting emission standards as established by the air pollution control board, but excluding such facilities installed for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable and excluding those facilities which rely for their efficacy on dilution, dispersion or assimilation of air contaminants in the ambient air after emission.

   (B) However, such deduction shall be allowed only

      (i)    with respect to tangible property which is depreciable, pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, the construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of which, in the case of industrial waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and only for expenditures paid or incurred prior to January first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, or which, in the case of air pollution control facilities, is initiated on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and

      (ii) on condition that such facilities have been certified by the state commissioner of environmental conservation or his or her designated representative, in the same manner as provided in either section 17-0707 or 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, as applicable, as complying with the provision of the environmental conservation law, the sanitary code and regulations, permits or orders promulgated pursuant thereto, and

      (iii) on condition that for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years, no deduction for such expenditures or for depreciation of the same property allowed for federal income tax purposes shall be allowed under this chapter, except to the extent that the basis of the property may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this subdivision, for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowed for federal income tax purposes for such expenditures or for depreciation of the same property be proportionately reduced in computing unincorporated business deductions for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years, and

      (iv) where the election provided for in subdivision (b) of section 11-509 of this chapter has not been exercised in respect to the same property.

   (C) (i)    If expenditures in respect to an industrial waste treatment facility or an air pollution control facility have been deducted as provided herein and if within ten years from the end of the taxable year in which such deduction was allowed such property or any part thereof is used for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable, the taxpayer shall report such change of use in its return for the first taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed and any carryback or carryover year, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter.

      (ii) If a deduction is allowed as herein provided for expenditures paid or incurred during any taxable year on the basis of a temporary certificate of compliance issued pursuant to the public health law, and if the taxpayer fails to obtain a permanent certificate of compliance upon completion of the facilities with respect to which such temporary certificate was issued, the taxpayer shall report such failure in its report for the taxable year during which such facilities are completed, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed and any carryback or carryover year, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter.

   (D) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this subdivision, such deduction shall be disregarded in computing gain or loss, and the gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such property shall be the gain or loss allowable for federal income tax purposes for such taxable year.

(10) In the case of mines, oil and gas wells and other natural deposits, no deduction of any allowance for percentage depletion pursuant to section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, as amended, shall be allowed. However, an allowance for depletion with respect to such property shall be deductible in the amount which would be allowable under section six hundred eleven of such internal revenue code if such deduction were computed without reference to such section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A of such code. With respect to the computation of depletion pursuant to this section, the basis for such computation for taxable years beginning in nineteen hundred seventy-two shall be the federal basis. For subsequent taxable years, the basis of such computation shall be reduced only by the deduction for the allowance for depletion deductible pursuant to this section. In any taxable year when any such property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to this subdivision, the gain or loss thereon entering into the computation of federal taxable income shall be disregarded in computing unincorporated business taxable income and there shall be added to or subtracted from federal gross income, so modified, the gain or loss upon such sale or other disposition. In computing such gain or loss, the basis of the property sold or disposed of shall be adjusted to reflect the deduction allowed with respect to such property pursuant to this subdivision.

(11) A deduction shall be allowed for that portion of wages and salaries paid or incurred for the taxable year for which a deduction is not allowed pursuant to the provisions of section two hundred eighty C of the internal revenue code.

(12) For taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property which is a qualified mass commuting vehicle described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph eight of subsection (f) of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code (relating to qualified mass commuting vehicles), a deduction shall be allowed for any amount which the taxpayer could have excluded for purposes of this chapter had it not made the election provided for in such paragraph eight as it was in effect for agreements entered into prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-four.

(13) For taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property which is a qualified mass commuting vehicle described in subparagraph (D) of paragraph eight of subsection (f) of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code (relating to qualified mass commuting vehicles), no deduction shall be allowed for any amount deductible for federal income tax purposes solely as a result of an election made pursuant to the provisions of such paragraph eight as it was in effect for agreements entered into prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-four.

(14) In the case of property placed in service in taxable years beginning before nineteen hundred ninety-four, for taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property subject to the provisions of section two hundred eighty-F of the internal revenue code and property subject to the provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code which is placed in service in this state in taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, no deduction shall be allowed for the amount allowable as a deduction determined under section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code.

(15) In the case of property placed in service in taxable years beginning before nineteen hundred ninety-four, for taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-one, except with respect to property subject to the provisions of section two hundred eighty-F of the internal revenue code and property subject to the provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code which is placed in service in this state in taxable years beginning after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-four, and provided a deduction has not been disallowed pursuant to subdivision thirteen of this section, a taxpayer shall be allowed with respect to property which is subject to the provisions of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code the depreciation deduction allowable under section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code as such section would have applied to property placed in service on December thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty.

(16) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, no deduction shall be allowed for interest, depreciation or any other expense directly or indirectly attributable to the holding, leasing or managing of real property or to income or gain therefrom if, and to the extent that, such holding, leasing or managing of real property is not deemed an unincorporated business carried on by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.

(17) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, no deduction shall be allowed for any expenses directly or indirectly attributable to activities described in paragraph two of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter if, and to the extent that, such activities are not deemed an unincorporated business carried on by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter.

(18) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, in the case of a taxpayer that is an unincorporated entity described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter, no deduction shall be allowed for any losses or expenses directly or indirectly attributable to the sale or other disposition of an interest in another unincorporated entity if, and to the extent that, such losses or expenses are attributable to activities of such other unincorporated entity not deemed an unincorporated business carried on by the taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-502 of this chapter.

(19) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, no deduction shall be allowed for interest, depreciation or any other expense directly or indirectly attributable to the provision by an owner, lessee or fiduciary holding, leasing or managing real property of the service of parking, garaging or storing of motor vehicles on a monthly or longer term basis to tenants at such real property if, and to the extent that, the provision of such services to such tenants is not deemed an unincorporated business pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (d) of section 11-502 of this chapter.

(20) For taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one, in the case of qualified property described in paragraph two of subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, other than qualified resurgence zone property described in subdivision twenty-two of this section, and other than qualified New York Liberty Zone property described in paragraph two of subsection b of section fourteen hundred L of the internal revenue code (without regard to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of such paragraph), no deduction shall be allowed for the amount allowable as a deduction under section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code.

(21) For taxable years ending after September tenth, two thousand one, in the case of qualified property described in paragraph two of subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code other than qualified resurgence zone property described in subdivision twenty-two of this section, and other than qualified New York Liberty Zone property described in paragraph two of subsection b of section fourteen hundred L of the internal revenue code (without regard to clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of such paragraph), a deduction shall be allowed with respect to such property equal to the depreciation deduction allowable under section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code as such section would have applied to such property had it been acquired by the taxpayer on September tenth, two thousand one, provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a passenger motor vehicle or a sport utility vehicle subject to the provisions of subdivision twenty-four of this section, the limitation under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision (a) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code applicable to the amount allowed as a deduction under this paragraph shall be determined as of the date such vehicle was placed in service and not as of September tenth, two thousand one.

(22) For purposes of subdivisions twenty and twenty-one of this section, qualified resurgence zone property shall mean qualified property described in paragraph two of subsection k of section one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code substantially all of the use of which is in the resurgence zone, as defined below, and is in the active conduct of a trade or business by the taxpayer in such zone, and the original use of which in the resurgence zone commences with the taxpayer after September tenth, two thousand one.

(23) For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a taxpayer that is not an eligible farmer as defined in subsection (n) of section six hundred six of the tax law, no deduction shall be allowed for the amounts allowable as a deduction under sections one hundred seventy-nine, one hundred sixty-seven and one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code with respect to a sport utility vehicle that is not a passenger automobile as defined in paragraph five of subsection (d) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code.

(24) For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand four, in the case of a taxpayer that is not an eligible farmer as defined in subsection (n) of section six hundred six of the tax law, a deduction shall be allowed with respect to a sport utility vehicle that is not a passenger automobile as defined in paragraph five of subsection (d) of section two hundred eighty F of the internal revenue code equal to the amounts allowable as a deduction under sections one hundred seventy-nine, one hundred sixty-seven and one hundred sixty-eight of the internal revenue code, determined as if such sport utility vehicle were a passenger automobile as defined in such paragraph five.








*§ 11-508 Allocation to the city.* ::


(a) General; allocation of business income. If an unincorporated business is carried on both within and without the city, as determined under regulations of the commissioner of finance, there shall be allocated to the city, in the manner provided in subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this section, a fair and equitable portion of its business income. For taxable years beginning before July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, if the unincorporated business has no regular place of business outside the city, all of such business income shall be allocated to the city.

(b) (1) Allocation by taxpayer's books. For taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand five, the portion allocable to the city may be determined from the books of the business if the methods used in keeping such books are approved by the commissioner of finance as fairly and equitably reflecting the income from the city.

   (2) (i) If a taxpayer determines the portion of business income to be allocated to the city using the method prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision on a timely filed original return with respect to each of the two taxable years, each of which must consist of twelve months, immediately preceding the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning on or after January first, two thousand five, the taxpayer may make a one-time election to continue to use that method for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand five and before January first, two thousand twelve. Such election shall be made by using the method prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision on an original timely filed return with respect to the first taxable year beginning on or after January first, two thousand five and before January first, two thousand six. Such election may not be made, or if made, shall be deemed revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year if, for either of the two taxable years immediately preceding the year in which the election is made, the commissioner of finance has determined the methods used in keeping such books do not fairly and equitably reflect the income from the city.

      (ii) (A)    A taxpayer that has made the election provided for in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph may revoke it by filing an original or amended return using an allocation method permitted by this section other than the method prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision unless the commissioner of finance has determined that such method does not fairly and equitably reflect the income from the city.

         (B) The election provided for in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year if, for any taxable year during which the election is intended to be in effect, the commissioner of finance has determined that the methods used in keeping the taxpayer's books do not fairly and equitably reflect the income from the city.

         (C) In the case of a taxpayer that is a partnership or other unincorporated entity, the election provided for in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be deemed to have been revoked as of the beginning of the taxable year unless one or more of the persons having a proportionate interest or interests, amounting to more than fifty percent of all such interests, in the taxpayer's unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions for such taxable year were persons having a proportionate interest or interests, amounting to more than fifty percent of all such interests, in the taxpayer's unincorporated business gross income and unincorporated business deductions at the end of the taxpayer's last taxable year beginning before January first, two thousand five. For purposes of this clause, a transfer of an ownership interest in unincorporated business gross income or unincorporated business deductions upon the death of a partner or owner to such deceased partner's or owner's estate shall be disregarded but transfers by such decedent's estate shall not be disregarded.

         (D) Once the election provided for in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph has been revoked by the taxpayer pursuant to clause (A) or deemed revoked pursuant to clauses (B) or (C) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer shall be barred from using the method prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision for the taxable year in which the election has been revoked or deemed revoked and any subsequent taxable year.

(c) Allocation by formula. If subdivision (b) does not apply to the taxpayer, the portion allocable to the city shall be determined by multiplying (A) the business income by (B) a business allocation percentage to be determined by adding together the percentages computed under paragraphs one, two and three of this subdivision, and dividing the result by the number of percentages; provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, a taxpayer that is a "manufacturing business," as defined in subdivision (g) of this section, may determine its business allocation percentage as provided in such subdivision (g):

   (1) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of real and tangible personal property connected with the unincorporated business and located within the city, by (B) the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all real and tangible personal property connected with the unincorporated business and located both within and without the city. For this purpose, for taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand five, real property shall include real property rented to the unincorporated business and, for this purpose, for taxable years beginning on and after January first, two thousand five, real and tangible personal property shall include real and tangible personal property rented to the unincorporated business and the value of such real and tangible personal property rented to the unincorporated business shall mean the product of (i) eight and (ii) the gross rents payable for the rental of such property during the taxable year.

   (2) Payroll percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the unincorporated business carried on within the city, by (B) the total of all wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the unincorporated business carried on both within and without the city.

   (3) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the gross sales or charges for services performed by or through an agency located within the city, by (B) the total of all gross sales or charges for services performed within and without the city. The sales or charges to be allocated to the city shall include all sales negotiated or consummated, and charges for services performed, by an employee, agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly situated at, connected by contract or otherwise with, or sent out from, offices of the unincorporated business, or other agencies, situated within the city; provided, however, that for taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six, sales of tangible personal property shall not be allocated to the city as hereinabove in this paragraph provided, but shall be allocated to the city only where shipments are made to points within the city, and provided, further, that:

      (A) for taxable years beginning on or after July first, two thousand five, for taxpayers having gross receipts for the taxable year (determined without regard to any deductions) of less than one hundred thousand dollars, charges for services performed shall be allocated to the city to the extent that the services are performed within the city;

      (B) for taxable years beginning on or after July first, two thousand six, for taxpayers having gross receipts for the taxable year (determined without regard to any deductions) of less than three hundred thousand dollars, charges for services performed shall be allocated to the city to the extent that the services are performed within the city; and

      (C) for taxable years beginning on or after July first, two thousand seven, for all other taxpayers, charges for services performed shall be allocated to the city to the extent that the services are performed within the city.

(d) Other allocation methods. The portion allocable to the city shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations of the commissioner of finance if it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that the income from the city is not fairly and equitably reflected under the provisions of either subdivision (b) or subdivision (c) of this section.

(e) Special rules for real estate. Income and deductions from the rental of real property, and gain and loss from the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, shall not be subject to allocation under subdivision (b), (c), or (d) of this section, but shall be considered as entirely derived from or connected with the state, other than this state, in which such property is located or, if such property is located in this state, the political subdivision thereof. To the extent that anything in the preceding sentence is inconsistent with any provision of subdivision (d) of section 11-502, subdivision (c) of section 11-506 or subdivision sixteen of section 11-507 of this chapter, the provisions of such subdivisions shall take precedence over the provisions of the preceding sentence.

(e-1) Special rules for publishers and broadcasters. 

   (1) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section to the contrary and except as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of publishing newspapers or periodicals, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of such paragraph three, the gross sales or charges for services arising from sales of subscriptions to, and advertising contained in, such newspapers or periodicals, to the extent that such newspapers or periodicals are delivered to points within the city.

   (2) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section to the contrary and except as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of broadcasting radio or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any other means of transmission, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of such paragraph three, a portion of the gross sales or charges for services arising from the sale of subscriptions to such programs or from the broadcasting of such programs and of commercial messages in connection therewith, such portion to be determined according to the number of listeners or viewers within and without the city.

   (3) Notwithstanding anything in this section (other than subdivision (e) of this section) to the contrary, in the case of a taxpayer that is substantially engaged, in the aggregate, in any combination of the businesses referred to in paragraphs one, two and four of this subdivision, the portion of business income allocable to the city shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section (as modified by paragraphs one, two and four of this subdivision), unless the commissioner of finance determines that the business income from the city is not fairly and equitably reflected under the provisions of such subdivision (c), in which event the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section shall apply in determining the portion of business income allocable to the city and the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section shall not apply. For purposes of this subdivision, a taxpayer shall be deemed to be substantially engaged in a business or businesses referred to in such paragraphs one and two if more than ten percent of the taxpayer's gross receipts for the taxable year are attributable to such business or businesses.

   (4) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph one or two of this subdivision to the contrary, for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand two, in the case of a taxpayer engaged in the business of publishing newspapers or periodicals, or broadcasting radio or television programs, whether through the public airwaves or by cable, direct or indirect satellite transmission, or any other means of transmission, there shall be allocated to the city, for purposes of paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section, the gross sales or charges to subscribers located in the city for subscriptions to such newspapers, periodicals, or program services. For purposes of this paragraph, a subscriber shall be deemed located in the city if, in the case of newspapers and periodicals, the mailing address for the subscription is within the city and, in the case of program services, the billing address for the subscription is within the city. For purposes of this clause, "subscriber" shall mean a member of the general public who receives such newspapers, periodicals or program services and does not further distribute them.

(e-2) Rules for receipts from certain services to investment companies. 

   (1) For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand one, for purposes of paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section, the portion of receipts received from an investment company arising from the sale of management, administration or distribution services to such investment company determined in accordance with paragraph two of this subdivision shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city (such portion referred to herein as the New York city portion).

   (2) The New York city portion shall be the product of the total of such receipts from the sale of such services and a fraction. The numerator of that fraction is the sum of the monthly percentages (as defined hereinafter) determined for each month of the investment company's taxable year for federal income tax purposes which taxable year ends within the taxable year of the taxpayer (but excluding any month during which the investment company had no outstanding shares). The monthly percentage for each such month is determined by dividing the number of shares in the investment company which are owned on the last day of the month by shareholders that are domiciled in the city by the total number of shares in the investment company outstanding on that date. The denominator of the fraction is the number of such monthly percentages.

   (3) (A) For purposes of this subdivision the term "domicile", in the case of an individual shall have the meaning ascribed to it under chapter seventeen of this title; an estate or trust is domiciled in the city if it is a city resident estate or trust as defined in paragraph three of subdivision (b) of section 11-1705 of this code; a business entity is domiciled in the city if the location of the actual seat of management or control is in the city. It shall be presumed that the domicile of a shareholder, with respect to any month, is his, her or its mailing address on the records of the investment company as of the last day of such month.

      (B) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "investment company" means a regulated investment company, as defined in section 851 of the internal revenue code, and a partnership to which section 7704(a) of the internal revenue code applies (by virtue of section 7704(c)(3) of such code) and that meets the requirements of section 851(b) of such code. The preceding sentence shall be applied to the taxable year for federal income tax purposes of the business entity that is asserted to constitute an investment company that ends within the taxable year of the taxpayer.

      (C) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "receipts from an investment company" includes amounts received directly from an investment company as well as amounts received from the shareholders in such investment company in their capacity as such.

      (D) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "management services" means the rendering of investment advice to an investment company, making determinations as to when sales and purchases of securities are to be made on behalf of an investment company, or the selling or purchasing of securities constituting assets of an investment company, and related activities, but only where such activity or activities are performed pursuant to a contract with the investment company entered into pursuant to section 15(a) of the federal investment company act of nineteen hundred forty, as amended.

      (E) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "distribution services" means the services of advertising, servicing investor accounts (including redemptions), marketing shares or selling shares of an investment company, but, in the case of advertising, servicing investor accounts (including redemptions) or marketing shares, only where such service is performed by a person who is (or was, in the case of a closed end company) also engaged in the service of selling such shares. In the case of an open end company, such service of selling shares must be performed pursuant to a contract entered into pursuant to section 15(b) of the federal investment company act of nineteen hundred forty, as amended.

      (F) For purposes of this subdivision, the term "administration services" includes clerical, accounting, bookkeeping, data processing, internal auditing, legal and tax services performed for an investment company but only if the provider of such service or services during the taxable year in which such service or services are sold also sells management or distribution services, as defined hereinabove, to such investment company.

(e-3) Rules for receipts for services performed by registered securities or commodities brokers or dealers.

   (1) For taxable years beginning after two thousand eight, in the case of a taxpayer which is a registered securities or commodities broker or dealer, for purposes of paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section, the receipts specified in subparagraphs (A) through (G) of this paragraph shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in such subparagraphs.

      (A) Receipts constituting brokerage commissions derived from the execution of securities or commodities purchase or sales orders for the accounts of customers shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such commissions.

      (B) Receipts constituting margin interest earned on behalf of brokerage accounts shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the mailing address in the records of the taxpayer of the customer who is responsible for paying such margin interest.

      (C) Gross income, including any accrued interest or dividends, from principal transactions for the purchase or sale of stocks, bonds, foreign exchange and other securities or commodities (including futures and forward contracts, options and other types of securities or commodities derivatives contracts) shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city either (i) to the extent that production credits are awarded to branches, offices or employees of the taxpayer within the city as a result of such principal transactions or (ii) if the taxpayer so elects, to the extent that the gross proceeds from such principal transactions (determined without deduction for any cost incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities) are generated from sales of securities or commodities to customers within the city based upon the mailing addresses of such customers in the records of the taxpayer. For purposes of clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the taxpayer shall separately calculate such gross income from principal transactions by type of security or commodity. For purposes of this subparagraph, gross income from principal transactions shall be determined after the deduction of any cost incurred by the taxpayer to acquire the securities or commodities. For purposes of this subdivision, the term "production credits" means credits granted pursuant to the internal accounting system used by the taxpayer to measure the amount of revenue that should be awarded to a particular branch or office or employee of the taxpayer which is based, at least in part, on the branch's, the office's or the employee's particular activities.

The term "public offering price" means the price agreed upon by the taxpayer and the issuer at which the securities are to be offered to the public. The term "selling concession" means the amount paid to the taxpayer for participating in the underwriting of a security where the taxpayer is not the lead underwriter.

      (E) Receipts constituting interest earned by the taxpayer on loans and advances made by the taxpayer to an entity affiliated with the taxpayer shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the principal place of business of such affiliated entity.

   (3) If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subdivision as a result of a securities correspondent relationship such taxpayer has with another registered securities or commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in this relationship as the clearing firm, such receipts shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in each of the subparagraphs in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. The amount of such receipts shall exclude the amount the taxpayer is required to pay to the correspondent firm for such correspondent relationship. If the taxpayer receives any of the receipts enumerated in paragraph (1) of this subdivision as a result of a securities correspondent relationship such taxpayer has with another registered securities or commodities broker or dealer with the taxpayer acting in this relationship as the introducing firm, such receipts shall be deemed to arise from services performed within the city to the extent set forth in each of the subparagraphs in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.

   (4) If, for purposes of subparagraph (A), (B), (F), or (G) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the taxpayer is unable from its records to determine the mailing address of the customer, the receipts described in any of such subparagraphs and such clause shall be deemed to arise from services performed at the branch or office of the taxpayer that generates the transaction for the customer that generated such receipts.

      (A) multiply the amount of its investment capital invested in each stock, bond or other security (other than governmental securities) during the period covered by its return by the issuer's allocation percentage (determined as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision) of the issuer or obligor thereof:

      (B) add together the products so obtained; and

      (C) divide the sum so obtained by the total of its investment capital invested during such period in stocks, bonds and other securities; provided, however, that in case any investment capital is invested in any stock, bond or other security during only a portion of the period covered by the return, only such portion of such capital shall be taken into account; and provided, further, that if a taxpayer's investment allocation percentage is zero, interest received on bank accounts shall be allocated in the manner provided in subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this section.

   (2) (A)    In the case of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under subchapter two or three-A of chapter six of this title, or subject to tax as a utility corporation under chapter eleven of this title, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be the percentage of the appropriate measure (as defined hereinafter) which is required to be allocated within the city on the report or reports, if any, required of the issuer or obligor under chapter six or eleven of this title for the preceding year. The appropriate measure referred to in the preceding sentence shall be: in the case of an issuer or obligor subject to subchapter two or three-A of chapter six of this title, entire capital; and in the case of an issuer or obligor subject to chapter eleven of this title as a utility corporation, gross income.

      (B) In the case of an issuer or obligor subject to tax under part four of subchapter three of chapter six of this title, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined as follows:

         (i) In the case of a banking corporation described in paragraphs one through eight of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this title which is organized under the laws of the United States, this state or any other state of the United States, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be its alternative entire net income allocation percentage, as defined in subdivision (c) of section 11-642 of this title, for the preceding year. In the case of such a banking corporation whose alternative entire net income for the preceding year is derived exclusively from business carried on within the city, its issuer's allocation percentage shall be one hundred percent.

         (ii) In the case of a banking corporation described in paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this title which is organized under the laws of a country other than the United States, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined by dividing (I) the amount described in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) of paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section 11-642 of this title with respect to such issuer or obligor for the preceding year, by (II) the gross income of such issuer or obligor from all sources within and without the United States, for such preceding year, whether or not included in alternative entire net income for such year.

         (iii) In the case of an issuer or obligor described in paragraph nine of subdivision (a) or in paragraph two of subdivision (d) of section 11-640 of this title, the issuer's allocation percentage shall be determined by dividing the portion of the entire capital of the issuer or obligor allocable to the city for the preceding year by the entire capital, wherever located, of the issuer or obligor for the preceding year.

      (C) Provided, however, that if a report or reports for the preceding year are not filed, or if filed do not contain information which would permit the determination of such issuer's allocation percentage, then the issuer's allocation percentage to be used shall, at the discretion of the commissioner of finance, be either (i) the issuer's allocation percentage derived from the most recently filed report or reports of the issuer or obligor or (ii) a percentage calculated, by the commissioner of finance, reasonably to indicate the degree of economic presence in the city of the issuer or obligor during the preceding year.

   (3) For purposes of this subdivision, investment capital shall be determined by taking the average value of the gross assets included therein (less liabilities deductible therefrom pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (h) of section 11-501 of this chapter). The value of investment capital which consists of marketable securities shall be the fair market value thereof and the value of investment capital other than marketable securities shall be the value thereof shown on the books and records of the unincorporated business in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

   (4) [Repealed.]

(g) Special rules for manufacturing businesses. 

   (1) For taxable years beginning on or after July first, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before January first, two thousand eleven, a manufacturing business may elect to determine its business allocation percentage by adding together the percentages determined under paragraphs one, two and three of subdivision (c) of this section and an additional percentage equal to the percentage determined under paragraph three of subdivision (c) of this section, and dividing the result by the number of percentages so added together.

   (2) An election under this subdivision must be made on a timely filed (determined with regard to extensions granted) original return for the taxable year. Once made for a taxable year, such election shall be irrevocable for that taxable year. A separate election must be made for each taxable year. A manufacturing business that has failed to make an election as provided in this paragraph shall be required to determine its business allocation percentage without regard to the provisions of this subdivision. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph to the contrary, the commissioner of finance may permit a manufacturing business to make or revoke an election under this subdivision, upon such terms and conditions as the commissioner may prescribe, where the commissioner determines that such permission should be granted in the interests of fairness and equity due to a change in circumstances resulting from an audit adjustment.

An unincorporated business shall be deemed to be primarily engaged in the activities described in the preceding sentence if more than fifty percent of its gross receipts for the taxable year are attributable to such activities.

(h) Notwithstanding subdivision (d) of this section, if it shall appear to the commissioner of finance that any business or investment allocation percentage determined as hereinabove provided does not properly reflect the activity, business, or income of a taxpayer within the city, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized in his or her discretion, in the case of a business allocation percentage, to adjust it by (1) excluding one or more of the factors therein; (2) including one or more factors, such as expenses, purchases, contract values (minus subcontract values); (3) excluding one or more assets in computing such allocation percentage, provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining unincorporated business entire net income, or (4) any other similar or different method calculated to effect a fair and proper allocation of the income reasonably attributable to the city, and in the case of an investment allocation percentage, to adjust it by excluding one or more assets in computing such percentage; provided the income therefrom is also excluded in determining unincorporated business entire net income. The commissioner of finance from time to time shall publish all rulings of general public interest with respect to any application of the provisions of this subdivision.

(i) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of this section, but subject to subdivision (g) of this section, the business allocation percentage shall be computed in the manner set forth in this subdivision.

*§ 11-509 Deductions not subject to allocation.* ::


(a) In computing unincorporated business taxable income, there shall be allowed (without allocation under section 11-508 of this chapter) deductions for reasonable compensation for taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand seven, not in excess of five thousand dollars, and for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand seven, not in excess of ten thousand dollars, for personal services of the proprietor and each partner actively engaged in the unincorporated business, but the aggregate of such deductions shall not exceed twenty per centum of the unincorporated business taxable income computed without the benefit of any deductions under this subdivision or the unincorporated business exemptions under section 11-510 of this chapter.

(b) Subject to the conditions provided in paragraphs three and four of this subdivision at the election of the taxpayer there shall also be allowed (without allocation under section 11-508 of this chapter) either or both of the items set forth in paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, except that only one of the items shall be allowed with respect to any one item of property.

   (1) Depreciation with respect to any property such as described in paragraphs three or four of this subdivision, and subject to the conditions provided therein, not exceeding twice the depreciation allowed with respect to the same property for federal income tax purposes. Such deduction shall be allowed only upon condition that no deduction shall be allowed pursuant to section 11-507 of this chapter for depreciation of the same property, and the total of all deductions allowed pursuant to this paragraph in any taxable year or years with respect to any property shall not exceed its cost or other basis and, in the case of an unincorporated business carried on both within and without this city, with respect to property described in paragraph four of this subdivision, such total shall not exceed its cost or other basis multiplied by (A) the percentage of the excess of the taxpayer's unincorporated business gross income over its unincorporated business deductions allocated to this city, or (B) the percentage of the taxpayer's business income allocated to this city, whichever is applicable, which percentage shall be determined under section 11-508 of this chapter for the first year such depreciation is deducted.

   (2) Expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction, erection or acquisition of any property such as described in paragraph three or four of this subdivision, and subject to the conditions provided therein, which is used or to be used for purposes of research or development in the experimental or laboratory sense. Such purposes shall not be deemed to include the ordinary testing or inspection of materials or products for quality control, efficiency surveys, management studies, consumer surveys, advertising, promotions or research in connection with literary, historical or similar projects. Such deduction shall be allowed only on condition that, in the case of an unincorporated business carried on both within and without this city, with respect to property described in paragraph four of this subdivision, such deduction does not exceed the expenditures multiplied by (A) the percentage of the excess of the taxpayer's unincorporated business gross income over its unincorporated business deductions allocated to this city, or (B) the percentage of the taxpayer's business income allocated to this city, whichever is applicable, which percentage shall be determined under section 11-508 of this chapter for the first year such depreciation is deducted, and that, for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years, no deduction shall be allowed pursuant to section 11-507 of this chapter on account of such expenditures or on account of depreciation of the same property, except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, or in case a deduction is allowable pursuant to this paragraph for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that any deduction allowable for federal income tax purposes on account of such expenditures or on account of depreciation of the same property shall be proportionately reduced in determining the deductions allowable pursuant to section 11-507 of this chapter for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years. With respect to property which is used or to be used for research and development only in part, or during only part of its useful life, the deduction allowable pursuant to this paragraph shall be limited to a proportionate part of the expenditures relating thereto. If a deduction shall have been allowed pursuant to this paragraph for all or part of such expenditures with respect to any property, and such property is used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally reported, the taxpayer shall report such use in the taxpayer's return for the first taxable year during which it occurs, and the commissioner of finance may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such deduction was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by subdivision (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter.

   (3) For purposes of this paragraph, such deduction shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in the city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (A) constructed, reconstructed or erected after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditure relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in the city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five or (C) acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified, and such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection would qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subsection (h) of section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references in such paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under subparagraph (A), (B) or (C) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer. However, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph one of this subdivision with respect to tangible personal property leased to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which a taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, a deduction under paragraph one may be taken in proportion to the part of the year such property is used by the taxpayer.

   (4) For purposes of this paragraph, such deductions shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this city and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, (A) the construction, reconstruction, or erection of which is completed after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this city and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five. Provided, however, a deduction under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be allowed with respect to property described in this paragraph only on condition that such property shall be principally used by the taxpayer in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture or commercial fishing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into wares suitable for use or which gives new shapes, new qualities or new combinations to matter which already has gone through some artificial process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances, and other similar equipment. Property used in the production of goods shall include machinery, equipment or other tangible property which is principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment or other tangible property used principally in the production of goods and shall include all facilities used in the manufacturing operation, including storage of material to be used in manufacturing and of the products that are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer, air and water pollution control facilities which qualify for elective deductions under subdivision nine of section 11-507 of this chapter may be treated, for purposes of this paragraph, as tangible property principally used in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture or commercial fishing, in which event, a deduction shall not be allowed under subdivision nine of section 11-507 of this chapter. However, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a deduction under paragraph one of this subdivision with respect to tangible personal property leased to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which a taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, a deduction under paragraph one shall be allowed in proportion to the part of the year such property is used by the taxpayer.

   (5) If the deductions allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this subdivision exceed the taxpayer's unincorporated business taxable income, determined without the allowance of such deductions, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years and may be deducted (without allocation under section 11-508 of this chapter) in computing unincorporated business taxable income for such year or years.

   (6) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a deduction has been allowed pursuant to paragraph one or two of this subdivision, the basis of such property shall be adjusted to reflect the deductions so allowed, and if the basis as so adjusted is lower than the adjusted basis of the same property for federal income tax purposes, there shall be added to federal gross income the amount of the difference between such adjusted bases.






*§ 11-510 Unincorporated business exemptions.* ::


In computing unincorporated business taxable income, there shall be allowed (without allocation under section 11-508 of this chapter):

(1) an unincorporated business exemption of five thousand dollars, prorated for taxable years of less than twelve months under regulations of the commissioner of finance;

(2) if a partner in an unincorporated business is taxable under this chapter or under any local law imposed pursuant to section one of chapter seven hundred seventy-two of the laws of nineteen hundred sixty-six, an exemption for the amount of the partner's proportionate interest in the excess of the unincorporated business gross income over the deductions allowed under sections 11-507 and 11-509 of this chapter, but this exemption shall be limited to the amount which is included in the partner's unincorporated business taxable income allocable to the city, or included in a corporate partner's net income allocable to the city, provided, however, no such exemption shall be allowed to an unincorporated business for any taxable year of the unincorporated business beginning after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred ninety-four.

   (1) such return shall be considered as its declaration if no declaration was required to be filed during the taxable year, but is otherwise required to be filed on or before January fifteenth of the succeeding year, and

   (2) such return shall be considered as the amendment permitted by subdivision (e) to be filed on or before January fifteenth if the tax shown on the return is greater than the estimated tax shown in a declaration previously made.

(a) General. If upon examination of a taxpayer's return under this chapter the commissioner of finance determines that there is a deficiency of income tax, the commissioner may mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file a return required under this chapter, the commissioner of finance is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's city unincorporated business taxable income and tax thereon, from any information in the commissioner's possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address in or out of the city. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner of finance has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. After ninety days from the mailing of a notice of deficiency or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, after ninety-days from the mailing of the conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, such notice shall be an assessment of the amount of tax specified therein, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, except only for any such tax or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has within such ninety day period filed with the tax appeals tribunal a petition under section 11-529 of this chapter. If the notice of deficiency or conciliation decision is addressed to a person outside of the United States, such period shall be one hundred fifty days instead of ninety days.

(c) Restrictions on assessment and levy. No assessment of a deficiency in tax and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun or prosecuted, except as otherwise provided in section 11-534 of this chapter, until a notice of deficiency has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the time for filing a petition with the tax appeals tribunal contesting such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to the taxable year has been both served upon the commissioner of finance and filed with the tax appeals tribunal, until the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final. For exception in the case of judicial review of the decision of the tax appeals tribunal, see subdivision (c) of section 11-530 of this chapter.

(d) Exceptions for mathematical errors. If a mathematical error appears on a return (including an overstatement of the amount paid as estimated tax), the commissioner of finance shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax appeals tribunal), or subdivision (b) of section 11-529 of this chapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax appeals tribunal based on a notice of deficiency) nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

(e)Exception where change in federal or New York state taxable income is not reported.

   (1) If the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-519 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing or decreasing the taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income as reported on the taxpayer's federal or New York state return or in not reporting a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes or in not filing an amended return or in not reporting the execution of a notice of waiver described in such section, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected federal or New York state taxable income by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-519 of this chapter, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal or New York state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.

   (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax appeals tribunal), or subdivision (b) of section 11-529 of this chapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax appeals tribunal based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall such assessment or collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

   (3) If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner of finance has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or not a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive the restrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency by a signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner of finance.

(g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of this chapter, a deficiency means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (i) the amount shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made or the tax computed by the taxpayer or by the commissioner of finance), and less, (ii) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency and plus (iii) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to payments on account of estimated tax; and a rebate means so much of an abatement, credit, refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.

(h) Exception where change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability is not reported. 

   (1) If a taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-519.1 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction of his or her sales and compensating use tax liability or in not filing a copy of an amended return or report relating to his or her sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected sales and compensating use tax liability, as same relates to credits claimed under this chapter by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the state change or correction or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was required by section 11-519.1 of this chapter, is filed accompanied by a statement showing where such state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.

   (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this chapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax appeals tribunal), or subdivision (b) of section 11-529 of this chapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax appeals tribunal based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall such assessment or the collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

   (3) If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of the city, and such notice shall be sufficient for purposes of this chapter. If the commissioner of finance has received notice that a person is acting for the taxpayer in a fiduciary capacity, a copy of such notice shall also be mailed to the fiduciary named in such notice.






*§ 11-522 Assessment.* ::


(a) Assessment date. The amount of tax which a return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return would have shown to be due but for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing of the return (including any amended return showing an increase of tax). In the case of a return properly filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by the commissioner of finance shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment is due. If a notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in subdivision (b) of section 11-521 of this chapter if no petition is both served on the commissioner of finance and filed with the tax appeals tribunal, or if a petition is filed, then upon the date when a decision of the tax appeals tribunal establishing the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If an amended return or report filed pursuant to section 11-519 of this chapter concedes the accuracy of a federal or New York state adjustment, change or correction, any deficiency in tax under this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended return, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding section 11-523 of this chapter. If a report or amended return or report filed pursuant to section 11-519.1 of this chapter concedes the accuracy of a state change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability, any deficiency in tax under this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed assessed on the date of filing such report, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding section 11-523 of this chapter. If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of section 11-521 of this chapter has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-519 of this chapter is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal or New York state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (h) of section 11-521 of this chapter, has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the state change or correction, or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was required by section 11-519.1 of this chapter, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than amounts paid as estimated income tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date of receipt of payment, notwithstanding any other provisions.

(b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of any tax under this chapter (including interest, additions to tax and assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the commissioner of finance may establish the same by regulations.

(c) Estimated income tax. No unpaid amount of estimated tax under section one hundred sixteen shall be assessed.

(d) Supplemental assessment. The commissioner of finance may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental assessment, subject to the provisions of section 11-521 of this chapter where applicable, whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.

      (A) no return is filed,

      (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax,

      (C) the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-519 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing or decreasing the taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income as reported on the taxpayer's federal or New York state income tax return, or the execution of a notice of waiver and the changes or corrections on which it is based or in not reporting a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, or in not filing an amended return, or

      (D) the taxpayer fails to file a report or amended return or report required under section 11-519.1 of this chapter, in respect of a change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability, relating to the purchase or use of items for which a sales or compensating use tax credit against the tax imposed by this chapter was claimed.

   (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of tax, both the commissioner of finance and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

   (3) Report of changed or corrected federal or New York state income. If the taxpayer shall, pursuant to section 11-519 of this chapter, report a change or correction or file an amended return increasing or decreasing federal or New York state taxable income or report the execution of a notice of waiver and the changes and corrections on which it is based, or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report or amended return) may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax attributable to such federal or New York state change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made.

   (4) Deficiency attributable to net operating loss carryback. If a deficiency is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback, it may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.

   (5) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time within two years from the making of the refund, except that the assessment may be made within five years from the making of the refund if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.

   (6) Request for prompt assessment. If a return is required for a decedent or for his or her estate during the period of administration, the tax shall be assessed within eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more than three years after the return was filed, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section.

   (7) Report on use of certain property.

If the taxpayer files a report or amended return or report required under section 11-519.1 of this chapter, in respect of a change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report) may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return or report was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax attributable to such state change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made.

(d) Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed if (1) a taxpayer omits from his or her city unincorporated business gross income an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five per centum of the amount of city unincorporated business gross income stated in the return, or (2) an estate or trust omits income from its return in an amount in excess of twenty-five percent of its income determined as if it were an individual. For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of finance of the nature and amount of such item.

(e) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner of finance is prohibited under subdivision (c) of section 11-521 of this chapter from making the assessment or from collecting by levy.

(d) Suspension of interest on deficiencies. If a waiver of restrictions on assessment of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, and if notice and demand by the commissioner of finance for payment of such deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of such waiver, interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the date of notice and demand.

(e) Tax reduced by carryback. If the the amount of tax for any taxable year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss, such reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this section for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year in which the net operating loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file.

(f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as tax.

      (B) In the case of a failure to file a tax return within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

      (A) With respect to any return the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two of this subdivision. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(b) Deficiency due to negligence.

   (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or rules or regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of section 11-524 with respect to the portion of the deficiency described in such paragraph (1) which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph (1), for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such deficiency (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (3) If any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, respectively, and the payee fails to include any portion of such payment in unincorporated business gross income, as that term is defined in section 11-506, any portion of a deficiency attributable to such failure shall be treated, for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any addition to tax is imposed under this subdivision by reason of the preceding sentence, the amount of the addition to tax imposed by paragraph one of this subdivision shall be five percent of the portion of the deficiency which is attributable to the failure described in the preceding sentence.

(c) Failure to file declaration or underpayment of estimated tax. If any taxpayer fails to file a declaration of estimated tax or fails to pay all or any part of an installment of estimated tax, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have made an underpayment of estimated tax. There shall be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-537 of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum upon the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment but not beyond the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. The amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of the amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or if no return was filed, ninety percent of the tax for such year) over the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last day prescribed for such payment. No underpayment shall be deemed to exist with respect to a declaration or installment otherwise due on or after the taxpayer's death. In any case in which there would be no underpayment if this subdivision were applied by substituting "eighty percent" for "ninety percent" where it appears in the second preceding sentence, the addition to tax under this subdivision shall be equal to seventy-five percent of the amount otherwise determined under this subdivision.

(d)Exception to addition for underpayment of estimated tax. The addition to tax under subdivision (c) of this section with respect to any underpayment of any installment shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds whichever of the following is the lesser:

   (1) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if the estimated tax were whichever of the following is the least:

      (A) The tax shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year, if a return showing a liability for tax was filed by the taxpayer for the preceding taxable year and such preceding year was a taxable year of twelve months, or

      (B) An amount equal to the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the taxpayer's return for, and the law applicable to, the preceding taxable year, or

      (C) An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the unincorporated business taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid. For purposes of this subparagraph, the unincorporated business taxable income shall be placed on an annualized basis by:

         (i) multiplying by twelve (or, in the case of a taxable year of less than twelve months, the number of months in the taxable year) the unincorporated business taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid, and

         (ii) dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the taxable year ending before the month in which such installment date falls, or

      (D) (i) If the base period percentage for any six consecutive months of the taxable year equals or exceeds seventy percent, an amount equal to ninety percent of the tax determined in the following manner:

            (I) take the unincorporated business taxable income for all months during the taxable year preceding the filing month,

            (II) divide such amount by the base period percentage for all months during the taxable year preceding the filing month,

            (III) determine the tax on the amounts determined under subclause (II), and

            (IV) multiply the tax determined under subclause (III) by the base period percentage for the filing month and all months during the taxable year preceding the filing month.

         (ii) For purposes of clause (i) of this subparagraph:

            (I) the base period percentage for any period of months shall be the average percent which the unincorporated business taxable income for the corresponding months in each of the three preceding years bears to the unincorporated business taxable income for the three preceding taxable years. The commissioner of finance may by regulations provide for the determination of the base period percentage in the case of new unincorporated businesses and other similar circumstances, and

            (II) the term "filing month" means the month in which the installment is required to be paid;

   (2) An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the actual unincorporated business taxable income for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.

(e) (1)    Except as provided in paragraph two hereof, subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this section shall not apply in the case of any taxpayer which had unincorporated business taxable income, or the portion thereof allocated within the city, of one million dollars or more for any taxable year during the three taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year involved.

   (2) The amount treated as the estimated tax under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (d) of this section shall in no event be less than seventy-five percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year beginning in nineteen hundred eighty-three or, if no return was filed, seventy-five percent of the tax for such year.

(f) Deficiency due to fraud.

   (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to two times the deficiency.

   (2) [Repealed.]

   (3) The addition to tax under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b).

(g) Additional penalty. Any taxpayer who with fradulent intent shall fail to pay any tax, or to make, render, sign or certify any return or declaration of estimated tax, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter shall be liable to a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter, to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(h) Additions treated as tax. The additions to tax and penalties provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as taxes, and any reference in this chapter to tax or tax imposed by this chapter, shall be deemed also to refer to the additions to tax and penalties provided by this section. For purposes of section 11-521, this subdivision shall not apply to—

   (1) any addition to tax under subdivision (a) except as to that portion attributable to a deficiency;

   (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c); and

   (3) any additional penalties under subdivisions (g) and (k).

(i) Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, the amounts shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his or her return shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the deficiency only if such return was filed on or before the last day prescribed for the filing of such return, determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing.

(j) Substantial understatement of liability. If there is a substantial understatement of tax for any taxable year, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of this subdivision, there is a substantial understatement of tax for any taxable year if the amount of the understatement for the taxable year exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year, or five thousand dollars. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return, reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of subdivision (g) of section 11-521). The amount of such understatement shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or any part of the addition to tax provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.

(k) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents. 

   (1) Any person who, with the intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident to the performance of other services for which such person receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under this chapter of any return, report, declaration, statement or other document which is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, report, declaration, statement or other document shall pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the term "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to do an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person (whether or not a member, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision, or control.

   (3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a person furnishing typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance with respect to a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.

   (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

(l) False or fraudulent document penalty. Any taxpayer that submits a false or fraudulent document to the department shall be subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars per document submitted, or five hundred dollars per tax return submitted. Such penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty or addition provided by law.






*§ 11-526 Overpayment.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner of finance, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment of tax and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any tax imposed by this chapter or by chapters six, seventeen and nineteen of this title, on the person who made overpayment, and the balance shall be refunded.

(b) Credits against estimated tax. The commissioner of finance may prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated tax for any taxable year of the amount determined to be an overpayment of the tax for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of tax is so claimed as a credit against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year, such amount shall be considered as a payment of the tax for the succeeding taxable year (whether or not claimed as a credit in the declaration of estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year), and no claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for the taxable year for which the overpayment arises.

(c) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax liability for a period in respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(d) Assessment and collection after limitation period. If any amount of income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of law in article fifty-two of the civil practice law and rules to the contrary, the procedures for the enforcement of money judgments shall not apply to the department of finance, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, as a garnishee, with respect to any amount of money to be refunded or credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.






*§ 11-527 Limitation on credit or refund.* ::


(a) General. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be allowable if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.

(b) Extension of time by agreement. If an agreement under the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (c) of section 11-523 of this chapter (extending the period for assessment of income tax) is made within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a claim for credit or refund the period for filing a claim for credit or refund, or for making credit or refund if no claims filed, shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a) of this section if a claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed.

(c) Notice of change or correction of federal or New York state taxable income. If a taxpayer is required by section 11-519 of this chapter to report a change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income reported on the taxpayer's federal or New York state income tax return, or to report a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal or New York state income tax purposes, or to file an amended return with the commissioner of finance, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such change or correction or such amended return was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. If the report or amended return required by section 11-519 of this chapter is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, no interest shall be payable on any claim for credit or refund of the overpayment attributable to the federal or New York state change or correction. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal or New York state change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer's amended federal or New York state income tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision.

(d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback. A claim for credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years from the time the return was due for the taxable year of the loss, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (b) of this section in respect of such taxable year, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, where applicable in respect of the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried back, whichever expires the latest.

(e) Failure to file claim within prescribed period. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section or subdivision (d) of section 11-530 of this chapter after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this chapter unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect of taxes under this chapter.

(f) Effect of petition to tax appeals tribunal. If a notice of deficiency for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 11-521 of this chapter and if the taxpayer files a timely petition with the tax appeals tribunal under section 11-529 of this chapter, the tax appeals tribunal may determine that the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not it also determines a deficiency for such year). No separate claim for credit or refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be allowed or made, except:

   (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax appeals tribunal which has become final;

   (2) as to any amount collected in excess of an amount computed in accordance with the decision of the tax appeals tribunal which has become final;

   (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy for collection has expired; and

   (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of a change or correction described in subdivision (c) of this section.

(g) Limit on amount of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment determined under subdivision (f) of this section shall, when the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of section 11-526 of this chapter and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the tax appeals tribunal determines as part of its decision was paid:

   (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or

   (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating the grounds upon which the tax appeals tribunal finds that there is an overpayment.

(h) Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day, determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer.

(i) Prepaid tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer, for taxable years beginning before January first, two thousand sixteen, on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment, and, for taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand sixteen, on the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment.

(j) Cross-reference. For provision barring refund of overpayment credited against tax of a succeeding year, see subdivision (d) of section 11-526 of this chapter.

(k) Notice of change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability. If a taxpayer is required by section 11-519.1 of this chapter to file a report or amended return or report in respect of a change or correction of his or her sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time such report or amended return or report was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. The amount of such credit or refund shall be computed without change of the allocation of income upon which the taxpayer's return (or any additional assessment) was based, and shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision.








*§ 11-528 Interest on overpayment.* ::


(a) General. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three-a of the general municipal law, interest shall be allowed and paid as follows at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to section 11-537 of this chapter, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum upon any overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:

   (1) from the date of the overpayment to the due date of an amount against which a credit is taken; or

   (2) from the date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by the commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than thirty days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.

   (3) Late and amended returns and claims for credit or refund. Notwithstanding paragraph one or two of this subdivision, in the case of an overpayment claimed on a return of tax which is filed after the last date prescribed for filing such return (determined with regard to extensions), or claimed on an amended return of tax or claimed on a claim, for credit or refund, no interest shall be allowed or paid for any day before the date on which such return or claim is filed.

   (4) Interest on certain refunds. To the extent provided for in regulations promulgated by the commissioner of finance, if an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed from the taxable year or period in which it is reported to the taxable year or period in which it belongs and the change results in an underpayment in a taxable year or period and an overpayment in some other taxable year or period, the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision with respect to an overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the limitation in such paragraph on the right to interest would result in a taxpayer not being allowed interest for a length of time with respect to an overpayment while being required to pay interest on an equivalent amount of the related underpayment. However, this paragraph shall not be construed as limiting or mitigating the effect of any statute of limitations or any other provisions of law relating to the authority of such commissioner to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow a credit or refund of an overpayment.

   (5) Amounts of less than one dollar. No interest shall be allowed or paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.

(b) Advance payment of tax and payment of estimated tax. The provisions of subdivisions (h) and (i) of section 11-527 of this chapter applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitations on credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment for purposes of this section.

(c) Refund within three months of claim for overpayment. If any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter is credited or refunded within three months after the last date prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for filing the return of such tax on which such overpayment was claimed or within three months after such return was filed, whichever is later, or within three months after an amended return was filed claiming such overpayment or within three months after a claim for credit or refund was filed on which such overpayment was claimed, no interest shall be allowed under this section on any such overpayment. For purposes of this subdivision, any amended return or claim for credit or refund filed before the last day prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for the filing of the return of tax for such year shall be considered as filed on such last day.

(d) Refund of tax caused by carryback. For purposes of this section, if any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter results from a carryback of a net operating loss, such overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable year in which such net operating loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file. For purposes of subdivision (c) of this section any overpayment described herein shall be treated as an overpayment for the loss year and such subdivision shall be applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return for the loss year as not filed before claim for such overpayment is filed. The term "loss year" means the taxable year in which such loss arises.

(e) No interest until return in processible form.

   (1) For purposes of subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section, a return shall not be treated as filed until it is filed in processible form.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a return is in a processible form if:

      (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and

      (B) such return contains:

         (i) the taxpayer's name, address, and identifying number and the required signatures, and

         (ii) sufficient required information (whether on the return or on required attachments) to permit the mathematical verification of tax liability shown on the return.

(f) Cross-reference. For provision with respect to interest after failure to file notice of federal or New York state change under section 11-519 of this chapter, see subdivision (c) of section 11-527 of this chapter.






*§ 11-529 Petition to tax appeals tribunal.* ::


(a) General. The form of a petition to the tax appeals tribunal, and further proceedings before the tax appeals tribunal in any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be governed by such rules as the tax appeals tribunal shall prescribe. No petition shall be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing and any appeal to the tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall be rendered, and notice thereof shall be given, in the manner provided by section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.

(b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety days, or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside of the United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency authorized by section 11-521 of this chapter, or if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of the conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, the taxpayer may file a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision (g) of section 11-527 of this chapter.

(c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:

   (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim for refund with the commissioner of finance,

   (2) the taxpayer has not previously filed with the tax appeals tribunal a timely petition under subdivision (b) of this section for the same taxable year unless the petition under this subdivision relates to a separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (f) of section 11-527 of this chapter, and

   (3) either: (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or (B) the commissioner of finance has mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than two years after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to the expiration of such two year period it has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance. If a taxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that he or she be mailed a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this subdivision for filing a petition for refund shall begin on the date such waiver is filed.

   (4) If the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code, a taxpayer who is eligible to file a petition for refund with the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to this subdivision may request a conciliation conference prior to filing such petition, provided the request is made within the time prescribed for filing the petition. Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, if the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance with the procedure established pursuant to section 11-124 of the code, a petition for refund may be filed no later than ninety days from the mailing of the conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding.

(d) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.

   (1) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files with the tax appeals tribunal a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, the tax appeals tribunal shall have power to determine a greater deficiency than asserted in the notice of deficiency and to determine if there should be assessed any addition to tax or penalty provided in section 11-525 of this chapter, if claim therefor is asserted at or before the hearing under the rules of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with the tax appeals tribunal a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the tax appeals tribunal may:

      (A) determine a deficiency for such year as to any amount of deficiency asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax appeals tribunal, and within the period in which an assessment would be timely under section 11-523 of this chapter, or

      (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in the petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the same taxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the commissioner of finance under this subdivision.

   (4) Restriction on further notices of deficiency. If the taxpayer files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal under this section, no notice of deficiency under section 11-521 of this chapter may thereafter be issued by the commissioner of finance for the same taxable year, except in case of fraud or with respect to a change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income required to be reported under section 11-519 of this chapter or with respect to a state change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability to be reported under section 11-519.1 of this chapter.

(e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax appeals tribunal under this chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the commissioner of finance:

   (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax;

   (2) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;

   (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency where such increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of federal or New York state taxable income required to be reported under section 11-519 of this chapter, and of which change or correction the commissioner of finance had no notice at the time he or she mailed the notice of deficiency or unless such increase in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability required to be reported under section 11-519.1 of this chapter, and of which change or correction the commissioner of finance had no notice at the time he or she mailed the notice of deficiency; and

   (4) whether any person is liable for a penalty under subdivision (k) of section 11-525.

(f) Evidence of related federal or state determination. Evidence of a federal or state determination relating to issues raised in a case before the tax appeals tribunal under this section shall be admissible, under rules established by the tax appeals tribunal.

(g) Jurisdiction over other years. The tax appeals tribunal shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.






*§ 11-530 Review of tax appeals tribunal's decision.* ::


(a) General. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be subject to judicial review at the instance of any taxpayer affected thereby in the manner provided by law for the review of a final decision or action of administrative agencies of the city. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance.

(b) Judicial review exclusive remedy. The review of a decision of the tax appeals tribunal provided by this section shall be the exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this chapter.

(c) Assessment pending review; review bond. Irrespective of any restrictions on the assessment and collection of deficiencies, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal in a decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter after the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section, notwithstanding that an application for judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his or her application for review is made, has paid the deficiency, has deposited with the commissioner of finance the amount of the deficiency, or has filed with the commissioner of finance a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under subdivision (h) of section 11-534 of this chapter) in the amount of the portion of the deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in respect of which the application for review is made and all costs and charges which may accrue against such taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, including costs of all appeals, and with surety approved by a justice of the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency (including interests and other amounts) as finally determined and such costs and charges. If, as a result of a waiver of the restrictions on the assessment and collection of a deficiency, any part of the amount determined by the tax appeals tribunal is paid after the filing of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

(d) Credit, refund or abatement after review. If the amount of a deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal is disallowed in whole or in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited, or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.

(e) Date of finality of tax appeals tribunal's decision. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall become final upon the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section for making an application for review, if no such application has been duly made within such time, or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by the tax appeals tribunal of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an application for review, the decision of the tax appeals tribunal shall be deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified mail to the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance.






*§ 11-531 Mailing rules; holidays; miscellaneous.* ::


(a) Timely mailing. 

   (1) If any return, declaration of estimated tax, claim, statement, notice, petition, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by the United States mail to the commissioner of finance, tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used in lieu of registered mail under this section. Except as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) (A) Any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

      (B) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in paragraph one of this subdivision. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

(b) Last known address. For purposes of this chapter, a taxpayer's last known address shall be given in the last return filed by the taxpayer, unless subsequently to the filing of such return the taxpayer shall have notified the commissioner of finance of a change of address.

(c) Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

(d) Certificate: unfiled return. For purposes of this chapter and sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter, the certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return or declaration of estimated tax has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required by or under the provisions of this title, shall be prima facie evidence that such tax has not been paid, that such return or declaration has not been filed, or that such information has not been supplied.






*§ 11-532 Collection, levy and liens.* ::


(a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the commissioner of finance, and the commissioner may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due it under this chapter if not otherwise specified. The commissioner of finance shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The commissioner of finance may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositories or financial agents of the city to receive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the commissioner of finance may prescribe; and the commissioner of finance shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner of finance.

(b) Notice and demand for tax. The commissioner of finance shall as soon as practicable give notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person's last known address. Except where the commissioner of finance determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.

(c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within the ten days after notice and demand herefor is given to such person under subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner of finance may within six years after the date of such assessment issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, commanding such person to levy upon and sell such person's real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If the commissioner of finance finds that the collection of the tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the commissioner of finance and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant without regard to the ten-day period provided in this subdivision.

(d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real, personal and other property of the taxpayer.

(e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the commissioner of finance shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.

(f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for the sheriff's services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the department of finance may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.

(g) Taxpayer not a resident of this state. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) of this section shall have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, and it appears to the commissioner of finance that it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, the commissioner of finance may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section 11-521 of this chapter. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in New York county, and such officer or employee shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the commissioner of finance may authorize the institution of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The commissioner of finance may also, in the commissioner's discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as the commissioner of finance shall deem proper and sufficient.

(h) Action by city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the corporation counsel of the city at the instance of the commissioner of finance as agent and trustee for the city to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced.

(i) Release of lien or vacating warrant. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision (d) or (g) of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.






*§ 11-533 Transferees.* ::


(a) General. The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax, penalty or interest due the commissioner of finance under this chapter, shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax to which the liability relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive transfer, in order, from the original taxpayer to the transferee involved, but not by more than three years in the aggregate. The term "transferee" includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee.

(b)    Exceptions.

   (1) If before the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the commissioner of finance in any court against the original taxpayer or the last preceeding transferee based upon the liability of the original taxpayer, then the period of limitation for assessment of liability of the transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after such claim has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.

   (2) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section or the immediately preceding paragraph of this subdivision for the assessment of the liability, the commissioner of finance and the transferee have both consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of tax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or refund, such agreement and any extension thereof shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof referred to in subdivision (b) of section 11-527 of this chapter. If the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subdivision (b) of section 11-527 of this chapter on the amount of the credit or refund, the periods specified in subdivision (a) of section 11-527 of this chapter shall be increased by the period from the date of such expiration to the date of agreement.

(c) Deceased transferor. If any person is deceased, the period of limitation for assessment against such person shall be the period that would be in effect if such person had lived.

(d) Evidence. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (e) of section 11-537 of this chapter the commissioner of finance shall use his or her powers to make available to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the transferee to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship to the original taxpayer or preceding transferee. See subdivision (e) of section 11-529 of this chapter for rules as to burden of proof.






*§ 11-534 Jeopardy assessment.* ::


(a) Authority for making. If the commissioner of finance believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, the commissioner shall, notwithstanding the provision of sections 11-521 and 11-536 of this chapter, and immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the commissioner of finance for the payment thereof.

(b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made before any notice in respect to the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under section 11-521 of this chapter, then the commissioner of finance shall mail a notice under such section within sixty days after the making of the assessment.

(c) Amount assessable before decision of tax appeals tribunal. The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or not the taxpayer has heretofore filed a petition with the tax appeals tribunal. The commissioner of finance may, at any time before the tax appeals tribunal renders its decision, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that the commissioner believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The tax appeals tribunal may in its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.

(d) Amount assessable after decision of tax appeals tribunal. If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the tax appeals tribunal is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the tax appeals tribunal in its decision.

(e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy assessment may not be made after the decision of the tax appeals tribunal has become final or after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of the tax appeals tribunal.

(f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed with the tax appeals tribunal and when the amount which should have been assessed has been determined by a decision of the tax appeals tribunal which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the commissioner of finance, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 11-526 of this chapter without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the commissioner of finance.

(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The commissioner of finance may abate the jeopardy assessment if the commissioner finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the tax appeals tribunal in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the tax appeals tribunal, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the tenth day after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.

(h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the commissioner of finance, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice or deficiency under section 11-521 of this chapter is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

(i) Petition to tax appeals tribunal. If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his or her petition under section 11-529 of this chapter, the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount the collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the tax appeals tribunal which has become final. If the tax appeals tribunal determines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced when the decision of the tax appeals tribunal is rendered.

(j) Stay of sale of seized property pending tax appeals tribunal decision. Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold:

   (1) if subdivision (b) of this section is applicable, prior to the issuance of the notice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section 11-529 of this chapter for filing a petition with the tax appeals tribunal, and

   (2) if a petition is filed with the tax appeals tribunal (whether before or after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the expiration of the period during which the assessment of the deficiency would be prohibited if subdivision (a) of this section were not applicable. Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if the commissioner of finance determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.

(k) Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-524 of this chapter, the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without regard to any notice and demand for payment issued under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.

(l) Early termination of taxable year. If the commissioner of finance finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove his or her property therefrom, or to conceal himself or herself or his or her property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the income tax for the current or the preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the commissioner of finance shall declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given to the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of the tax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the finding of the commissioner of finance made as herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.

(m) Reopening of taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of the taxable period of the taxpayer by the commissioner of finance as provided in subdivision (l) of this section, the commissioner of finance may reopen such taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the commissioner of finance to have received income, within the current taxable year, since the termination of such period. A taxable period so terminated by the commissioner of finance may be reopened by the taxpayer if the taxpayer files with the commissioner of finance a true and accurate return of taxable income and credits allowed under this chapter for taxable period, together with such other information as the commissioner of finance may by regulations prescribe.

(n) Furnishing of bond where taxable year is closed by the commissioner of finance. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section prior to the expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of finance, a bond to insure the timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes or any taxes under this chapter for prior years.






*§ 11-535 Criminal penalties; cross-reference.* ::


For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title.






*§ 11-536 Armed forces relief provisions.* ::


(a) Time to be disregarded. In the case of an individual serving in the armed forces of the United States or serving in support of such armed forces, in an area designated by the president of the United States by executive order as a "combat zone" at any time during the period designated by the president by executive order as the period of combatant activities in such zone, or hospitalized outside the state as a result of injury received while serving in such an area during such time, the period of service in such area, plus the period of continuous hospitalization outside the state attributable to such injury, and the next one hundred eighty days thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this chapter, in respect of the tax liability (including any interest, penalty, or addition to the tax) of such individual:

   (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed within the time prescribed therefor:

      (A) filing any return of tax;

      (B) payment of any tax or any installment thereof or of any other liability to the commissioner of finance, in respect thereof;

      (C) filing a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for credit or refund or for redetermination of a deficiency, or application for review of a decision rendered by the tax appeals tribunal;

      (D) allowance of a credit or refund of tax;

      (E) filing a claim for credit or refund of tax;

      (F) assessment of tax;

      (G) giving or making any notice or demand for the payment of any tax, or with respect to any liability to the commissioner of finance in respect of tax;

      (H) collection, by the commissioner of finance, by levy or otherwise of the amount of any liability in respect of tax;

      (I) bringing suit by the city, or any officer, on its behalf, in respect of any liability in respect of tax; and

      (J) any other act required or permitted under this chapter or specified in regulations prescribed under this section by the commissioner of finance.

   (2) The amount of any credit or refund (including interest).

(b) Action taken before ascertainment of right to benefits. The assessment or collection of the tax imposed by this chapter or of any liability to the commissioner of finance in respect of such tax, or any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the commissioner of finance in connection therewith, may be made, taken, begun, or prosecuted in accordance with law, without regard to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, unless prior to such assessment, collection, action, or proceeding it is ascertained that the person concerned is entitled to the benefit of subdivision (a) of this section.

(c) Members of armed forces dying in action. In the case of any person who dies during an induction period while in active service as a member of the armed forces of the United States, if such death occurred while serving in a combat zone during a period of combatant activities in such zone, as described in subdivision (a) of this section, or as a result of wounds, disease or injury incurred while so serving, the tax imposed by this chapter shall not apply with respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of such person's death, or with respect to any prior taxable year ending on or after the first day he or she so served in a combat zone, and no returns shall be required in behalf of such person or such person's estate for such year; and the tax for any such taxable year which is unpaid at the date of his or her death, including interest, additions to tax and penalties, if any, shall not be assessed and if assessed, the assessment shall be abated and, if collected, shall be refunded to the legal representative of such person's estate if one has been appointed and has qualified, or, if no legal representative has been appointed or has qualified, to such person's surviving spouse.






*§ 11-537 General powers of commissioner of finance.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner of finance shall administer and enforce the tax imposed by this chapter and the commissioner is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require such facts and information to be reported, as the commissioner may deem necessary to enforce the provision of this chapter; and the commissioner may delegate his or her powers and functions under all parts of this chapter to one of the commissioner's deputies or to any employee or employees of the commissioner's department.

(b) Examination of books and witnesses. The commissioner of finance for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for the purpose of making an estimate of tax of any person, shall have power to examine or to cause to have examined, by any agent or representative designated by the commissioner for that purpose, any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return, and may require the attendance of the person rendering the return or any officer or employee of such person, or the attendance of any other person having knowledge in the premises, and may take testimony and require proof material for the commissioner's information, with power to administer oaths to such person or persons.

(c) Abatement authority. The commissioner of finance, of his or her own motion, may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment of tax under this part, or any liability in respect thereof, if the commissioner of finance determines under uniform rules prescribed by the commissioner that the administration and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due. The commissioner may also abate, of his or her own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in respect thereof, which is excessive in amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No claim for abatement under this subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.

(d) Special refund authority. Where no questions of fact or law are involved and it appears from the records of the commissioner of finance that any moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under a mistake of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner of finance at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the power, upon making a record of his or her reasons therefor in writing, to cause such moneys so paid and being erroneously and illegally held to be refunded.

(e) Cooperation with the United States, this state and other states. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-538 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United States or the secretary's delegates, or the proper officer of this or any other state imposing an income tax upon the incomes of individuals, or the authorized representative of any such officer, to inspect any return filed under this chapter or may furnish to such officer or his or her authorized representative an abstract of any such return or supply such officer with information concerning an item contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of tax liability under this chapter, but such permission shall be granted or such information furnished to such officer or such officer's representative only if the laws of the United States or of such state, as the case may be, grant substantially similar privileges to the commissioner of finance and such information is to be used for tax purposes only; and provided further the commissioner of finance may furnish to the secretary of the treasury of the United States or the secretary's delegates or to the tax commission of the state of New York or its delegates such returns filed under this chapter and other tax information, as he or she may consider proper for use in court actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code or the tax law of the state of New York, whether civil or criminal, where a written request therefor has been made to the commissioner of finance by the secretary of the treasury or by such tax commission or by their delegates, provided the laws of the United States or the laws of the state of New York grant substantially similar powers to the secretary of the treasury of the United States or the secretary's delegates or to such tax commission or its delegates. Where the commissioner of finance has so authorized use of returns or other information in such actions or proceedings, officers and employees of the department of finance may testify in such actions or proceedings in respect to such returns or other information.

(f) (1)    Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall set the overpayment and underpayment rates of interest to be paid pursuant to sections 11-524, 11-525 and 11-528 of this chapter, but if no such rate or rates of interest are set, such overpayment rate shall be deemed to be set at six percent per annum and such underpayment rate shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such overpayment and underpayment rates shall be the rates prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision, but the underpayment rate shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum.

Such application shall also state that the tenant agrees to comply with and be subject to such rules as may be issued from time to time by the department of finance.

      (c) The department of finance shall issue a certificate of eligibility upon determining that an application filed pursuant to this paragraph meets the requirements set forth in this subdivision, provided, however, that no such certificate of eligibility shall be issued if any payments in lieu of taxes, water or sewer charges or other lienable charges are due and owing with respect to such eligible government-owned building at the time such application is pending, unless such payments in lieu of taxes or charges are at such time being paid in timely installments pursuant to a written agreement with the department of finance or other appropriate agency.

*§ 11-705 Returns.* ::


a. Every tenant subject to tax under this chapter shall file with the commissioner of finance a return with respect to the taxes payable for the three month periods ending on the last days of August, November and February of each year and a final return with respect to the taxes payable for the tax year ending on the last day of May of each year. Such returns shall be filed within twenty days from the expiration of the period covered thereby. A tenant who is exempt from the tax by reason of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 11-704 of this chapter shall nevertheless be required to file a final return, provided, however, that for tax years beginning on or after June first, nineteen hundred ninety-five and ending on or before May thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven, no such final return shall be required from such exempt tenant with respect to taxable premises if (1) the tenant's rent for such premises, determined without regard to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base rent allowed by this chapter, does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for the tax year and (2) in the case of a tenant who has more than one taxable premises, the aggregate rents for all such premises, determined without regard to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base rent allowed by this chapter, do not exceed fifteen thousand dollars for the tax year. For tax years beginning on June first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven and ending on or before May thirty-first, two thousand one, no such final return shall be required from such exempt tenant with respect to any taxable premises if (1) the tenant's rent for such premises, determined without regard to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base rent allowed by this chapter, does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars for the tax year and (2) the amount of rent received or due from any subtenant of such exempt tenant with respect to such premises does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars for the tax year. For tax years beginning on or after June first, two thousand one, no such final return shall be required from such exempt tenant with respect to any taxable premises if (1) the tenant's rent for such premises, determined without regard to any deduction from or reduction in rent or base rent allowed by this chapter, does not exceed two hundred thousand dollars for the tax year and (2) the amount of rent received or due from any subtenant of such exempt tenant with respect to such premises does not exceed two hundred thousand dollars for the tax year. Notwithstanding anything in this subdivision to the contrary, for tax periods beginning on or after September first, nineteen hundred ninety-five, no return shall be required pursuant to this subdivision with respect to any taxable premises located in that part of the city specified in paragraph one of subdivision h of section 11-704 of this chapter, and no such taxable premises shall be taken into account for purposes of clause two of the preceding sentence. The commissioner of finance may permit or require returns (including final returns) to be made for other periods and upon such dates as the commissioner may specify and if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, the commissioner may require such returns to be made for shorter periods than those prescribed by the foregoing provisions of this section, and upon such dates as he or she may specify.

b. The commissioner of finance may by regulation require the filing of information returns and supplemental information returns by landlords and by tenants of taxable premises, whether or not they are required to pay the tax imposed by this chapter, upon such dates or at such times as the commissioner may specify if he or she deems the filing of such information returns necessary for proper administration of this chapter.

c. The form of returns and information returns shall be prescribed by the commissioner of finance and shall contain such information as the commissioner may deem necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns or amended information returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.

d. If a return or information return is not filed, or if a return of any kind when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected return.






*§ 11-706 Payment of tax.* ::


a. The tax imposed by this chapter shall be due and payable on or before the twentieth day of the calendar month following the end of each tax period and shall be paid to the commissioner of finance, as follows: The tax to be paid at such time shall be based on the base rent for such tax period and the rate of tax shall be the one which would be applicable if the base rent for such period were the same for each tax period during the tax year, except that the payment required to be made together with the final return or at the time that the final return should be filed shall be the amount by which the actual tax for the tax year exceeds the amounts previously paid for the tax year.

b. Where the final return shows that the amount of tax paid for the tax year exceeds the actual tax for such year, the commissioner of finance shall make the appropriate refund as promptly as possible, provided, however, that where the commissioner of finance has reason to believe that the final return is inaccurate, the commissioner may withhold the refund in whole or in part. The making of a refund pursuant to this subdivision shall not prevent the commissioner of finance from making a determination that additional tax is due or from pursuing any other method to recover the full amount of the actual tax due for the tax year.

c. Where a tenant ceases to do business the tax, as measured by the tenant's base rent for the prior part of the tax year, shall be due immediately, and the tenant shall file a final return, but, should the tenant continue to pay rent for the taxable premises, the tenant shall file the normally required returns and a final return for the tax year, provided, however, that any such tax payment shall be applied in reduction of the tax payments required to be made with such returns or with the final return for such tax year.






*§ 11-707 Records to be kept.* ::


Every landlord of taxable premises and every tenant of taxable premises shall keep records of rent paid and received by him or her in such form as the commissioner of finance may by regulation require, all leases or agreements which fix the rents or rights of tenants of taxable premises, and such other records, receipts and other papers relevant to the ascertainment of the tax due under this chapter as the commissioner of finance may by regulation require. Such records shall be offered for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the commissioner of finance. Such records, unless the commissioner of finance consents to a sooner destruction or requires that they be kept for a longer time, shall be preserved for a period of three years except that leases or agreements which fix the rents or rights of a tenant shall be kept for a period of three years after the expiration of the tenancy thereunder.






*§ 11-708 Determination of tax.* ::


If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the conciliation* of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of** the commissioner's own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision, provided, however, that any such proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited and there is filed an undertaking with the commissioner of finance, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding or (b) at the option of the taxpayer such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, interest and penalties stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-709 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if written application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within eighteen months from the date fixed by this chapter for filing the return on which such payment was based or within six months of the payment thereof, whichever of such periods expire the later. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied, the commissioner of finance shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing of any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to section one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking shall first be filed with the commissioner of finance, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-708 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-708 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional, or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-710 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-708 of this chapter.






*§ 11-711 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to the taxpayer on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-712 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce payment of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which tax or penalties might be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which the sheriff may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of section forty-four of the personal property law, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

7.

If any amount of tax required to be paid together with a return, other than the final return for a tax year, is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date until twenty days after the end of the tax year during which such payments were due or until such prior time as the tax paid for the tax year equals seventy-five percent of the full tax required to be paid for the tax year. Such interest shall be paid with the final return for the tax year to which it relates. In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.

(b) Interest on underpayment; final return. If any amount of tax required to be paid together with the final return for a tax year is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment. In computing the amount of interest to be paid, such interest shall be compounded daily. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.

(c) (1)    Failure to file final return.

      (A) In case of failure to file a return under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate, and, in addition thereto, where a tenant, with respect to any taxable premises, is exempt from tax by reason of paragraph two of subdivision b of section 11-704 of this chapter, there shall be imposed a penalty of one hundred dollars.

      (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on final return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a final return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

   (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on final return. In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a final return required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown (including a determination made pursuant to section 11-708 of this chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice and demand therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.

   (4) Limitations on additions.

      (A) With respect to any final return, the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph (1) shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.

      (B) With respect to any final return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (1) of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (1)) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(d) Underpayment due to negligence.

   (1)    If any part of an underpayment of tax is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or any rules or regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to five percent of the underpayment.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (b) of this section with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph (1) which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph (1), for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (1)    If any part of an underpayment of tax is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to fifty percent of the underpayment.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the penalty determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (b) of this section with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph (1) which is attributable to fraud, for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (c) or (d) of this section.

(f) Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(g) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.

(h) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate shall be the same for each subdivision and shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.

   (2) General rule. The rate of interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.

   (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:

      (A) The federal short-term rate for any month shall be the federal short-term rate determined by the United States secretary of the treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal revenue code for use in connection with section six thousand six hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be rounded to the nearest full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate shall be increased to the next highest full percent).

      (B) Period during which rate applies.

         (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with respect to setting the rate of interest for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine.

   (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be published in the city record, and give other appropriate general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no later than twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of such interest rate shall not be included within paragraph (a) of subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the city charter relating to the definition of a rule.

(i) Miscellaneous. 

   (1) The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be prima facie evidence thereof.

   (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title.

(j) Substantial understatement of liability. If there is a substantial understatement of tax for any tax year, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of this subdivision, there is a substantial understatement of tax for any tax year if the amount of the understatement for the tax year exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the final return for the tax year or five thousand dollars. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the final return for the tax year, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return, reduced by any rebate. The amount of such understatement shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or any part of the addition to tax provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.

(k) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents. 

   (1) Any person who, with the intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident to the performance of other services for which such person receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under this chapter of any return, report, statement or other document which is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, report, statement or other document shall pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the term "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to do an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person (whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision, or control.

   (3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a person furnishing typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance with respect to a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.

   (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the courts may require the production of, and may admit in evidence so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information contained in or relating thereto, to the United States of America or any department thereof, the state of New York or any department thereof, any agency or any department of the city of New York provided the same is requested for official business; nor to prohibit the inspection for official business of such returns by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the district attorney of any county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns or items thereof.

b. (1)    Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for a period of five years thereafter.

The tax appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.






*§ 11-717 Notices and limitation of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person for whom it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by such person or if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of a notice as in this paragraph provided for shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice as in this subdivision provided.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the final return for the tax year to which the assessment relates; provided, however, that where no return has been made as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1)    Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

Editor's note: Section 3 of L.L. 2019/137 provides: "Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 8 of title 11 of the administrative code of the city of New York to the contrary, the commissioner of finance may issue a refund or credit to any person who has paid the tax or portion thereof imposed under subparagraph (C) of paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section 11-802 of such code with respect to a medallion taxicab for the tax year beginning on June 1, 2019 to the extent such payment exceeds the tax obligation for any tax year beginning on or after June 1, 2019, and to the extent of such excess amount, such person shall not have any obligations under sections 11-807 or 11-808 of such code for any such tax year. The commissioner of finance may issue such a refund or credit without submission of a written application by the taxpayer."

      (D) For tax years beginning on or after June first, two thousand nineteen, on all motor vehicles for transportation of passengers, including medallion taxicabs, four hundred dollars for each such vehicle.

b. To the extent that the tax as imposed by subdivision a of this section may be invalid solely because it is based on the use in the city of the motor vehicles, the tax shall also be deemed to be based on the privilege of using the public highways or streets of the city by such motor vehicle. Under such circumstances the rate of tax shall be the same and all other provisions of this chapter shall be equally applicable.

c. If the first use of any motor vehicle subject to the tax imposed hereunder occurs on or after December first and before March first in any tax year, the tax for that year shall be one-half of the tax hereinabove provided; and, if the first such use occurs on or after March first in any tax year, the tax for that tax year shall be one-fourth of the tax hereinabove provided.

d. In applying the tax on commercial motor vehicles with respect to tractors, trailers and semi-trailers, the tax shall be measured by the weight of the tractor plus the maximum gross weight of the trailer or semi-trailer with the greatest such maximum gross weight to be drawn by such tractor. No trailer or semi-trailer shall be subject to any separate or additional tax under this chapter.








*§ 11-803 Exemptions.* ::


The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to motor vehicles owned and operated, or leased for their exclusive use by:

*§ 11-804 Presumption and burden of proof.* ::


For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all motor vehicles used in the city of the types described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of subdivision three of section 11-801 of this chapter are used principally in the city or used principally in connection with a business carried on within the city and are subject to the tax until the contrary is established; and it shall be presumed that all motor vehicles used in the city of the types described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision four of section 11-801 of this chapter are used regularly, even though not principally in the city and are subject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving that a motor vehicle is not taxable under this chapter shall be on the owner of the motor vehicle.






*§ 11-805 Records to be kept.* ::


Every owner of a motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter shall keep such records of his or her vehicles and of their use in the city in such form as the commissioner of finance may by regulation require. Such records shall be offered for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the commissioner of finance or the commissioner's duly authorized agent or employee and shall be preserved for a period of three years except that the commissioner of finance may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer.






*§ 11-806 Registration.* ::


a. By July thirteenth, nineteen hundred sixty or, upon acquiring any motor vehicle subject to tax hereunder after such date, within two days of such acquisition, every owner shall file with the commissioner of finance a certificate of registration in such form as prescribed by the commissioner of finance.

b. In order to determine whether motor vehicles are subject to the tax under this chapter and to facilitate administration thereof an information registration certificate in such form as is prescribed by the commissioner of finance shall be filed with the commissioner of finance by any person who owns or acquires:

   1. A motor vehicle of a type described in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of subdivision three of section 11-801 of this chapter which is registered in the city under the vehicle and traffic law or is used in the city in connection with a business carried on within the city; or

   2. A motor vehicle of the type described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subdivision four of section 11-801 of this chapter which is registered in the city under the vehicle and traffic law or is used in the city. Such an information registration certificate shall be filed by July thirteenth, nineteen hundred sixty or, if a motor vehicle is acquired after such date, within two days after such acquisition. An information registration certificate, however, need not be filed with respect to any motor vehicle for which a registration certificate has been filed pursuant to subdivision a of this section. The commissioner of finance may, by regulation, provide that information registration certificates need not be filed with respect to a type of motor vehicle or with respect to any general group within a type of motor vehicle.






*§ 11-807 Returns.* ::


a. On or before the twentieth day of June in each year commencing with the year nineteen hundred sixty, every owner of a motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter shall file a return with the commissioner of finance. A supplemental return shall also be filed by every owner with regard to each motor vehicle subject to tax acquired during any tax year at a time subsequent to the filing of the owner's regular return. Such supplemental return shall be filed with the commissioner of finance within a stated time, as fixed by regulation of the commissioner of finance, after the acquisition of the motor vehicle. An owner who acquires a motor vehicle subject to the tax after the commencement of a tax year and who has not filed a return or supplemental return with respect to such motor vehicle shall file a return with respect to it within two days after its acquisition by the owner.

b. The commissioner of finance, by regulation, may require that each person required under this chapter to file an information registration certificate file an information return with the commissioner of finance annually or at such other times as the commissioner deems appropriate for proper administration of this chapter. The commissioner of finance may, by regulation, provide that information returns need not be filed or that they be filed at different times with respect to a type of motor vehicle or with respect to any general group within a type of motor vehicle or with respect to any particular circumstances.

c. The commissioner of finance may permit or require returns, supplemental returns or information returns to be filed at times other than those specified in the commissioner's regulations. If the commissioner deems it necessary in order to insure payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, the commissioner of finance may require any return, supplemental return or information return to be filed with him or her at a time other than that fixed by such commissioner.

d. The form of returns, supplemental returns and information returns shall be prescribed by the commissioner of finance and shall contain such information as the commissioner may deem necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns, amended supplemental returns or amended information returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.

e. If a return, supplemental return or information return is not filed, or if a return of any kind when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected return.






*§ 11-808 Payment of tax.* ::


a. At the time of filing a return or supplemental return the owner shall pay to the commissioner of finance the tax imposed hereunder. Such tax shall be due and payable on the last day on which such return or supplemental return is required to be filed, regardless of whether such a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly indicates the amount of tax due.

b. Where an owner of a motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter replaces it with another motor vehicle during a tax year, the owner shall be entitled, upon approval by the commissioner of finance, to have any tax paid with respect to the replaced vehicle credited toward the tax payable with respect to the replacement vehicle for the balance of such tax year, and the owner shall pay no additional tax for such tax year with respect to it unless its nature or its maximum gross weight requires the payment of a higher amount of tax than that paid with respect to the replaced vehicle. A supplemental return, where required, shall be filed with respect to a replacement vehicle irrespective of whether additional tax is payable. Upon the grant of a waiver of tax by the commissioner of finance a purchaser of a motor vehicle subject to tax under this chapter who purchases it during a tax year from an owner who has paid the tax shall not be required to pay the tax with respect to such motor vehicle for the balance of such tax year if, and only if, the owner obtains, and submits to the commissioner of finance together with his or her return or supplemental return, a certificate or its equivalent (as prescribed by the commissioner of finance) signed by the prior owner to the effect that the prior owner has not had the tax paid credited toward any replacement vehicle and will not seek to obtain such a credit for any replacement vehicle purchased in the future. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to authorize a refund merely because a motor vehicle with respect to which the tax has been paid is sold or otherwise disposed of during the course of the tax year.

c. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the tax imposed on medallion taxicabs pursuant to subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter shall be due and payable in two equal installments, the first of which shall be due and payable on or before the last day on which the return or supplemental return for the tax year is required to be filed, and the second of which shall be due and payable on or before the first day of December in such tax year; provided, however, that if a medallion taxicab is acquired subsequent to the first day of November in such tax year, the full amount of the tax imposed for the tax year shall be due and payable on or before the last day on which the supplemental return with respect to such medallion taxicab is required to be filed.

d. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the tax imposed on medallion taxicabs pursuant to subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter shall, to the extent not previously paid, be due and payable on or before December first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine; provided, however, that if the tax imposed on a medallion taxicab would, but for the provisions of this subdivision, be due and payable subsequent to December first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine, the due date of such tax shall be determined without regard to this subdivision; and provided, further, that nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to extend the date for payment of any tax imposed by paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter as such paragraph two was in effect immediately prior to its amendment by the local law which added this subdivision.

e. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter or of chapter five of title nineteen of this code to the contrary, the taxi and limousine commission may require by rule the payment of the tax imposed on medallion taxicabs pursuant to this chapter as a condition precedent of the licensing or license renewal of such medallion taxicabs, and the taxi and limousine commission shall have the authority to deny the license or the renewal thereof for any medallion taxicab that fails to pay such tax.






*§ 11-809 Stamps and other indicia of payment.* ::


a. The commissioner of finance may, by regulation, provide that the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter shall be evidenced by suitable stamps or other indicia of payment in a form prescribed by the commissioner of finance and that every owner shall affix such stamps or other indicia of payment in the manner prescribed by regulation to each motor vehicle for which a tax had been paid, or shall otherwise keep the indicia of payment with the vehicle, readily available for inspection, in the manner prescribed by regulation. The owner or driver of the vehicle, upon demand, shall exhibit the indicia of payment to the commissioner of finance or the commissioner's duly authorized agent or employee or to any police officer of this city or state. The commissioner of finance may, by regulation, make similar provision for the use of stamps or other indicia that no tax is payable with respect to particular motor vehicles.

b. An owner who sells a motor vehicle shall not transfer any stamp or other indicia of payment to the purchaser except on a sale to a purchaser to whom the owner has properly given the certificate provided for in section 11-808 of this chapter with regard to not obtaining a credit toward any tax payable with respect to a replacement vehicle. The commissioner of finance shall, by regulation, provide for the destruction of the stamp or other indicia of payment or its return to the commissioner of finance upon all sales except where transfer to the purchaser is permitted and, where the motor vehicle sold has been replaced, for the issuance of replacement stamps or indicia of payment.






*§ 11-809.1 Collection of tax by commissioner of motor vehicles.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, the tax imposed by this chapter on any commercial motor vehicle with a maximum gross weight of ten thousand pounds or less and on any motor vehicle for transportation of passengers, other than a medallion taxicab, shall be collected by the commissioner of motor vehicles, provided that any such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered pursuant to any provision of section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law. The owner of each such motor vehicle shall pay the tax due thereon to the commissioner of motor vehicles on or before the date upon which such owner registers or renews the registration of such motor vehicle or is required to register or renew the registration thereof pursuant to section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law.

b. Notwithstanding any provision of section four hundred of the vehicle and traffic law to the contrary, payment of the tax with respect to a motor vehicle described in subdivision a of this section shall be a condition precedent to the registration or renewal thereof of such motor vehicle and to the issuance of any certificate of registration and plates or removable date tag in accordance with the vehicle and traffic law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and no such certificate of registration, plates or tag shall be issued unless such tax has been paid. If the registration period applicable to any such vehicle is a period of not less than two years, as a result of the application of the provisions of paragraph c of subdivision five of section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law, the tax required to be paid pursuant to this section shall be the annual tax specified in section 11-802 of this chapter multiplied by the number of years in the registration period. The commissioner of motor vehicles, upon payment of the tax pursuant to this section or upon the application of any person exempt therefrom, shall furnish to each taxpayer paying the tax a receipt for such tax and to each other taxpayer or exempt person a statement, document or other form prescribed by the commissioner of motor vehicles, showing that such tax has been paid or is not due with respect to such motor vehicle.

c. Notwithstanding the definition of the term "tax year" contained in subdivision fourteen of section 11-801 of this chapter, for purposes of the taxes payable to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section, "tax year" shall mean the twelve-month registration period applicable to the subject motor vehicle under the vehicle and traffic law and, in the case of a registration period of at least two years, shall mean each succeeding twelve-month period falling within such registration period.

d. Where the tax imposed by this chapter has been paid to the commissioner of finance with respect to a motor vehicle for a tax year described in subdivision fourteen of section 11-801 of this chapter, and subsequent thereto but within such tax year the same taxpayer pays a tax to the commissioner of motor vehicles with respect to such motor vehicle pursuant to this section, such taxpayer shall be entitled to a refund or credit from the commissioner of finance for the portion of the tax paid to the commissioner of finance which is attributable to the period beginning on the first day of the first tax year (as the term "tax year" is defined in subdivision c of this section) for which the tax is paid to the commissioner of motor vehicles and ending on the following May thirty-first, provided, however, that no such refund or credit shall be allowed if the amount thereof is less than five dollars. Any refund or credit to which a taxpayer is entitled pursuant to this subdivision shall be promptly refunded or credited, without interest, by the commissioner of finance, and the commissioner of finance may promulgate such rules as he or she deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this subdivision. Any amount for which the taxpayer is entitled to a refund or credit pursuant to this subdivision may be allowed as a credit against the tax payable to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section to the extent and in the manner provided for in the agreement authorized by subdivision k of this section.

e. Whenever any fee or portion of a fee paid for the registration of a motor vehicle under the provisions of the vehicle and traffic law is refunded pursuant to the provisions of subdivision one or one-a of section four hundred twenty-eight thereof, the amount of any tax paid to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section upon such registration shall also be refunded by the commissioner of motor vehicles, provided that where a fee is refunded pursuant to subdivision one-a of such section four hundred twenty-eight, the amount of tax to be refunded shall be limited to the tax paid for a tax year commencing subsequent to the end of the first twelve-month period of such registration.

f. Where the annual registration period applicable to a particular class of motor vehicle begins and ends on the same dates for all motor vehicles within such class, the tax payable to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section with respect to a motor vehicle within such class which is registered or required to be registered after the commencement of such annual registration period shall be determined for such period as follows:

   1. If such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered before the first day of the seventh month of such period, the tax shall be the amount specified in subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter.

   2. If such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered on or after the first day of the seventh month of such period but before the first day of the tenth month of such period, the tax shall be one-half of the amount specified in subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter.

   3. If such motor vehicle is registered or required to be registered on or after the first day of the tenth month of such period, the tax shall be one-fourth of the amount specified in subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter.

g. The provisions of subdivision b of section 11-808 of this chapter shall apply to this section with such modifications or adaptations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section and to ensure collection of the appropriate annual tax specified in subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter, and with due regard to the respective responsibilities of the commissioner of finance and the commissioner of motor vehicles under this section and to the definitions of "tax year" contained in subdivision c of this section and subdivision fourteen of section 11-801 of this chapter. The agreement between the commissioner of finance and the commissioner of motor vehicles authorized by subdivision k of this section may contain such provisions concerning the division of responsibility for collection of the taxes imposed by this chapter and the granting of refunds or credits as are consistent with this section and subdivision b of section 11-808 of this chapter, and the commissioner of finance and the commissioner of motor vehicles may also adopt such rules as they deem necessary for such purposes.

h. Notwithstanding any provision of section 11-807 of this chapter to the contrary, at the time a tax is required to be paid to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section, the person required to pay such tax shall file a return with the commissioner of motor vehicles in such form and containing such information as he or she may prescribe. The taxpayer's application for registration or the renewal thereof shall constitute the return required under this subdivision unless the commissioner of motor vehicles shall otherwise provide by rule. A return filed pursuant to this subdivision with respect to a motor vehicle for a tax year or years shall be in lieu of any return otherwise required to be filed with respect thereto pursuant to section 11-807 of this chapter.

i. In any case in which the tax imposed by this chapter is required to be paid to the commissioner of motor vehicles but is not so paid, the commissioner of finance shall collect such tax and all of the provisions of this chapter relating to collection of taxes by the commissioner of finance shall apply with respect thereto.

j. Notwithstanding any provision of section four hundred of the vehicle and traffic law to the contrary, in those cases in which the commissioner of finance is responsible for collecting the tax imposed by this chapter, the commissioner of motor vehicles shall not issue a certificate of registration, plates or removable date tag for any motor vehicle subject to such tax with respect to which the commissioner of finance has notified the commissioner of motor vehicles that such tax has not been paid, unless the registrant submits proof, in a form approved by the commissioner of motor vehicles, that such tax has been paid, or is not due, with respect to such motor vehicle.

k. The commissioner of finance is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into an agreement with the commissioner of motor vehicles to govern the collection of the taxes imposed by this chapter which are required to be paid to the commissioner of motor vehicles pursuant to this section. Such agreement shall provide for the exclusive method of collection, custody and remittal to the commissioner of finance of the proceeds of any such tax; for the payment by the city of the reasonable expenses incurred by the department of motor vehicles in connection with the collection of any such tax; for the commissioner of finance, or a duly designated representative, upon his or her request, not more frequently than once in each calendar year at a time agreed upon by the state comptroller, to audit the accuracy of the payments, distributions and remittances to the city; and for such other matters as may be necessary and proper to effectuate the purposes of such agreement. Such agreement shall have the force and effect of a rule or regulation of the commissioner of motor vehicles and shall be filed and published in accordance with any statutory requirements relating thereto.

l. The commissioner of motor vehicles shall promptly notify the corporation counsel of the city of any litigation instituted against such commissioner which challenges the constitutionality or validity of any provision of this chapter, or of the enabling act pursuant to which it was adopted, or which attempts to limit or question the application of either such law, and such notification shall include copies of the papers served upon such commissioner.

m. The commissioner of motor vehicles shall begin to collect taxes in accordance with the provisions of this section at such time as is specified in the agreement between the commissioner of motor vehicles and the commissioner of finance provided for in subdivision k of this section.

n. In addition to any other powers granted to the commissioner of motor vehicles in this chapter or any other law, he or she is hereby authorized and empowered:

   1. to adopt and amend rules appropriate to the carrying out of his or her responsibilities under this chapter;

   2. to request information concerning motor vehicles and persons subject to the provisions of this chapter from the department of motor vehicles of any other state, the treasury department of the United States or the appropriate officials of any city or county of the state of New York; and to afford such information to such department of motor vehicles, treasury department or officials of such city or county, any provision of this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding;

   3. to delegate his or her functions under this section to a deputy commissioner in the department of motor vehicles or any employee of such department or to any county clerk or other officer who acts as the agent of such commissioner in the registration of motor vehicles;

   4. to require all persons owning motor vehicles with respect to which the tax imposed by this chapter is payable to the commissioner of motor vehicles to keep such records as he or she may prescribe and to furnish such information upon his or her request; and

   5. to extend, for cause shown, the time for filing any return required to be filed with the commissioner of motor vehicles for a period not exceeding sixty days.

o. To the extent that any provision of this section is in conflict with any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall be controlling, but in all other respects such other provisions of this chapter shall remain fully applicable with respect to the imposition, administration and collection of the taxes imposed by this chapter.

The taxpayer's application for a license or the renewal thereof shall constitute the return required under this subdivision unless the taxi and limousine commission shall otherwise provide by rule. A return filed pursuant to this subdivision with respect to a designated licensed vehicle for a tax period or periods shall be in lieu of any return otherwise required to be filed with respect thereto pursuant to section 11-807 of this chapter. Unless the taxi and limousine commission otherwise requires, the filing of a return shall not be required for the tax periods described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of subdivision m of this section.

i. In any case in which the tax imposed by this chapter is required to be paid to the taxi and limousine commission but is not so paid, the commissioner of finance shall collect such tax and all of the provisions of this chapter relating to collection of taxes by the commissioner of finance shall apply with respect thereto.

k. The commissioner of finance is hereby authorized and empowered to enter into an agreement with the taxi and limousine commission to govern the collection of the taxes imposed by this chapter which are required to be paid to the taxi and limousine commission pursuant to this section.

   1. The tax due on a designated licensed vehicle, the license for which expires on or after the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve and before the first day of June in the year two thousand fourteen, shall be determined as follows:

      (A) For a designated licensed vehicle whose license expires on or after the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve and before the first day of June in the year two thousand fourteen, the amount of tax for the tax period between the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve and the date the license shall expire for such designated licensed vehicle pursuant to chapter five of title nineteen of the code shall be the sum of (i) the annual tax specified in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter for any twelve-month period within such tax period, and (ii) the amount determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for any period of less than twelve months within such tax period. The amount of tax so determined shall be payable on or before the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve. In the event the amount of tax due and payable under this subparagraph shall not have been paid within thirty days of the first day of June in the year two thousand twelve, the taxi and limousine commission shall suspend the license for such designated licensed vehicle, and the license for any such designated licensed vehicle which has expired shall not be renewed until such time as such tax is paid.

      (B) For purposes of subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the amount of tax for a period of less than twelve months shall be determined as follows:

         (i) if such period is nine months or more, the amount for such period shall be the full amount of annual tax provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter;

         (ii) if such period is more than six months but less than nine months, the amount for such period shall be three-fourths of the amount of annual tax provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter;

         (iii) if such period is more than three months but less than six months, the amount for such period shall be one-half of the amount of annual tax provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter; and

         (iv) if such period is less than three months, the amount for such period shall be one-fourth of the amount of annual tax provided in subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of subdivision a of section 11-802 of this chapter.

   2. Upon the date for payment set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the taxi and limousine commission shall require the taxpayer to provide a proof of payment of the tax to the commissioner of finance for the period beginning on the first day of June in the year two thousand eleven and ending on the thirty-first day of May in the year two thousand twelve or any part of such period for which the taxpayer was subject to the tax. In the event the taxpayer has not paid such tax to the commissioner of finance: (i) the license for any designated licensed vehicle described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be renewed until such time as such tax, together with any applicable interest or penalties, has been paid to the commissioner of finance and (ii) if such tax remains unpaid as of the end of the thirty-day period set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of this subdivision, the license for any designated licensed vehicle described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph one of this subdivision shall be suspended until such time as such tax, together with any applicable interest or penalties, is paid to the commissioner of finance.

   3. to delegate its functions under this section to any commissioner or employee of such commission;

   4. to require any person who is an owner, as defined in chapter five of title nineteen of the code, of a designated licensed vehicle to keep such records as it prescribes and to furnish such information upon its request; and

   5. to extend, for cause shown, the time for filing any return required to be filed with the taxi and limousine commission for a period not exceeding sixty days.

o. To the extent that any provision of this section is in conflict with any other provision of this chapter, the provisions of this section shall be controlling, but in all other respects such other provisions of this chapter shall remain fully applicable with respect to the imposition, administration and collection of the taxes imposed by this chapter.






*§ 11-810 Determination of tax.* ::


If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices such as motor vehicle registration with the department of motor vehicles and/or any other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (i)* serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-811 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if written application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied, the commissioner of finance shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing or* notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer, unless an undertaking shall first be filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-810 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-810 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or on the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-812 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if the taxpayer institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-810 of this chapter.






*§ 11-813 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to the taxpayer on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-814 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce payment of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which tax or penalties might be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, the commissioner may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgement docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but such officer or employee shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of section forty-four of the personal property law, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (1) of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (1)) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

*§ 11-819 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person for whom it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last registration of a motor vehicle filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, or in any application made by such person, or if no such registration has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of a notice as in this subdivision provided for shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice as in this subdivision provided.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent registration or return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of such return; provided, however, that where no registration or no return has been made as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, commissioner of motor vehicles, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, commissioner of motor vehicles, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, commissioner of motor vehicles, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by rule of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

(a) The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action by the commissioner of finance to levy, assess, determine or enforce the collection of tax, interest or penalty imposed by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent report, no assessment of additional tax, interest or penalty shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a report, provided, however, that where no report has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time. The commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, with interest at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of section 11-905 of this chapter or, if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum computed from the date of overpayment to a date (to be determined by the commissioner of finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than thirty days, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within six months from the payment thereof. Notice of any determination of the commissioner of finance with respect to an assessment of tax, interest or penalty or with respect to a claim for refund or any other notice, demand or request shall be given by mailing the same to the insurer to the address of its New York city office last filed with the commissioner of finance or, if there is no such office, to the address of its main office last filed with the commissioner of finance or, in the absence of any filed address, to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of any notice, demand or request by the commissioner of finance shall be presumptive evidence of its receipt by the insurer and any period of time to be determined with reference to the giving of such notice, demand or request shall commence to run from the date of such mailing. The determination of the commissioner of finance shall finally and irrevocably fix the amount of any tax, interest or penalty due or to be refunded unless the taxpayer, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the taxpayer and to the commissioner of finance with reference to the amount of the tax, interest or penalty assessed or to be refunded. The decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason, by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if such proceeding is commenced by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. Such proceeding shall not be commenced by the taxpayer unless: (1) the amount of any tax assessed and sought to be reviewed with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the decision confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (2) in the case of a review of a decision assessing any taxes, penalties and interest, at the option of the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover all of the taxes, penalties and interest assessed by such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the commencement of the proceeding. No determination or proposed determination of tax, interest or penalty due or to be refunded shall be reviewed or enjoined in any manner except as set forth herein.

(b) In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has commenced a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal adverse to such taxpayer on its application for a refund, the commissioner of finance shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.

(c) In computing the amount of interest to be paid under this section, such interest shall be compounded daily.

(a) The moneys received by the commissioner of finance as a tax on policies covering property in each borough of the city shall be disbursed by the commissioner of finance as follows:

   1. Ten percent to the firemen's association of the state of New York, for the endowment, benefit and maintenance of the volunteer firemen's home at Hudson, but in no event to exceed the sum of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) annually.

   2. The balance to the general fund of the city established pursuant to section one hundred nine of the charter, except as provided in paragraph three of this subdivision.

   3. a. Volunteer firemen's benevolent fund; trustee. From the balance specified in paragraph two of this subdivision, a sum, not to exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars in any one year, shall be paid into a fund to be known as the volunteer firemen's benevolent fund, which shall be administered as hereinafter provided by the fire commissioner, as trustee of such fund, for the benefit of indigent volunteer firefighters, their surviving spouses and orphans.

      b. Persons entitled to benefits from fund. All funds received by the fire commissioner as trustee under this paragraph shall be expended by the fire commissioner for the relief of:

         (i) all indigent volunteer firefighters who served as such for a period of five years in a duly organized volunteer fire company in the former towns of New Lots, Flatlands, Gravesend, New Utrecht and Flatbush in the county of Kings, or in the territory now included in the borough of Richmond, or in the territory now included in the borough of Queens, or in the territory now included in the borough of the Bronx, and who were honorably discharged after such five years of service, or who having been members of a duly organized volunteer fire company within any such town or territory, which company was disbanded by reason of the installation of a paid fire department, and were members of such company for at least one year prior to its disbandment;

         (ii) the surviving spouses and orphans of any such volunteer firefighters.

      c. Fund benefits of beneficiaries on rolls as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one. During the lifetime of those relief beneficiaries who appear as such as of December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one upon the records of the trustees of the exempt firemen's benevolent fund of the county of Kings, or of the trustees of the exempt firemen's benevolent fund of the borough of Queens, or of the trustees of the exempt firemen's benevolent fund of the borough of Staten Island, or of the trustees of the exempt firemen's benevolent fund of the borough of the Bronx, it shall be the duty of the fire commissioner, as such trustee, to pay to such beneficiaries from the volunteer firemen's benevolent fund referred to in subparagraph a hereof, the same amounts as were being periodically paid to such beneficiaries as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred fifty-two.

      d. Fund benefits of residents of firemen's home. It shall be the duty of the fire commissioner, as such trustee, to pay from such fund referred to in subparagraph a, the sum of ten dollars monthly to each volunteer firefighter in residence at the volunteer firemen's home at Hudson, who qualified for entrance into such home by reason of service as a volunteer firefighter within the area now included within the boundaries of the city of New York. No other payments shall be made from such fund to any such volunteer firefighter while in residence at such home.

      e. Eligibility of persons who applied for fund benefits after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one, and prior to the establishment of fund. Upon the establishment of the volunteer firemen's benevolent fund referred to in subparagraph a hereof, the fire commissioner or the fire commissioner's authorized subordinates shall investigate and determine the need for benefits of all persons who, after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred fifty-one and prior to the establishment of such volunteer firemen's benevolent fund, applied for benefits payable from any of the benevolent funds mentioned in subparagraph c hereof, and who are receiving benefits therefrom at the time of the establishment of such fund referred to in subparagraph a. No such person shall be found to be in need of benefits, nor shall any such person be paid any benefits from such last-mentioned fund unless the fire commissioner or the fire commissioner's authorized subordinates shall determine that such person is indigent. In the event that any such person is thus found to be in need of benefits, the fire commissioner shall pay to such person from such last-mentioned fund, the same periodic amounts as the trustees mentioned in subparagraph c hereof were paying as of June thirtieth, nineteen hundred fifty-two, to a person who had the same status and who was receiving benefits from the borough or county fund which would be currently liable for the payment of benefits to such person, but for the provision of section 13-532 of the code. It shall be the duty of the fire commissioner and the fire commissioner's authorized subordinates to maintain and carry out continuously, such investigation procedures as may be necessary to assure that benefits will not be paid from such fund to any persons who are not in need as herein specified.

      f. Eligibility for benefits of persons applying therefor after establishment of fund. All persons applying after the establishment of the volunteer firemen's benevolent fund for benefits payable therefrom shall be investigated as to need by the fire commissioner or the fire commissioner's authorized subordinates, and the eligibility of such persons for benefits and the amount thereof to be awarded and paid to them shall be determined by the fire commissioner or the fire commissioner's authorized subordinates in accordance with the standards specified in subparagraph e hereof. Benefits shall be paid from such fund to eligible persons in accordance with such determination and it shall be the duty of the fire commissioner and the fire commissioner's subordinates continuously to maintain and carry out as to such persons investigation procedures such as are described in subparagraph e hereof. The fire commissioner, as part of his or her investigation to determine eligibility of persons for fund benefits, shall request from the duly appointed representative of the volunteer firefighters in each borough a report on such person's service and indigency. Such report shall be solely for the information of the fire commissioner and shall not be binding upon the fire commissioner in arriving at a determination as to eligibility. In the event that such report is not submitted within ten days from the date of request, the fire commissioner shall determine eligibility on the basis of the facts developed in the fire commissioner's own investigation.

      g. Excess moneys. In the event that the benefits paid by the fire commissioner, as trustee, during any period of one year beginning on the first day of February shall not equal the sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars, the unexpended balance shall be paid into the general fund of the city established pursuant to section one hundred nine of the charter, except that the fire commissioner may retain in the volunteer firemen's benevolent fund such amount as may be necessary to meet the commitments of such fund until the revenue from the tax collected under this chapter in the ensuing taxable year shall become available.

*§ 11-1102 Imposition of excise tax.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, for the privilege of exercising its franchise or franchises, or of holding property, or of doing business in the city, on or after August first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, every utility shall pay to the commissioner of finance an excise tax which shall be equal to two per centum of its gross income until and including December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and shall be equal to two and thirty-five hundredths per centum thereafter, except that the rate as to persons engaged in the business of operating omnibuses with a carrying capacity of more than seven persons shall be one per centum until and including December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and one and seventeen hundredths per centum thereafter, and except that as to persons engaged in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated railroads, the rate shall be three per centum until and including December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and three and fifty-two one hundredths per centum thereafter, and every vendor of utility services in the city shall pay to the commissioner of finance an excise tax which shall be equal to two per centum of its gross operating income until and including December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and shall be equal to two and thirty-five one hundredths per centum thereafter, except that as to persons engaged in the business of operating omnibuses with a carrying capacity of more than seven persons other than omnibuses used exclusively for the transportation of children to and from schools operated under contracts made pursuant to the provisions of the education law, and not subject to the jurisdiction of the department of public service, the rate shall be one per centum of its gross operating income until and including December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and one and seventeen hundredths per centum thereafter. Such tax shall be in addition to any and all other taxes, charges and fees imposed by any other provision of law and shall be paid at the time and in the manner hereinafter provided, but any person to the extent that it is subject to tax hereunder shall not be liable to any tax under any other of the local laws of the city enacted pursuant to chapter ninety-three of the laws of nineteen hundred sixty-five as amended, or article two-b of the general city law, with respect to its gross income or gross operating income hereunder taxed, as the case may be.

b. So much of the gross income of a utility shall be excluded from the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter, as is derived from sales for resale to vendors of utility services validly subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, except to the extent that such gross income is derived from sales of gas, electricity, steam, water or refrigeration or sales or rendering of gas, electric, steam, water or refrigeration service to a vendor of utility services for resale to its tenants as an incident to such vendor's activity of renting premises to tenants.

c. For the purpose of proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that the gross income or gross operating income of any person taxable hereunder is taxable and is derived from business conducted wholly within the territorial limits of the city until the contrary is established, and the burden of proving that any part of its gross income or gross operating income is not so derived shall be upon such person. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentence or in any provision of section twenty-b of the general city law or any other provision of law, for taxable periods beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, gross income and gross operating income derived from the provision of mobile telecommunications services shall be deemed to be derived from business conducted wholly within the territorial limits of the city where the place of primary use of the mobile telecommunications services is within the territorial limits of the city.

The gross operating income of a vendor of utility services derived from sales to its tenants of gas, electricity, steam, water, or refrigeration or sales or rendering to its tenants of gas, electric, steam, water or refrigeration service, as an incident to such vendor's activity of renting premises to tenants, shall be excluded from the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter, but, with regard to sales to its tenants of gas, electricity, or steam or sales or rendering to its tenants of gas, electric or steam service, only to the extent that the tax imposed by this chapter has been validly paid or accrued with respect to a prior sale of such gas, electricity or steam or sale or rendering of gas, electric or steam service.

f. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, for taxable periods beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, if a partnership is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter as a utility or as a vendor of utility services, no person who is a partner in such a partnership shall be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter on such partner's distributive share of the gross income or gross operating income of such partnership.

   (2) If a person is a partner in a partnership subject to the tax imposed by this chapter and that person is separately subject to the supervision of the state department of public service or is a utility or a vendor of utility services based on its activities exclusive of any activities of such partnership, for taxable periods beginning on or after August first, two thousand two, such person shall be subject to the tax imposed by this chapter only on its separate gross income or separate gross operating income, which shall not include such person's distributive share of the gross income or gross operating income of such partnership.

*§ 11-1104 Returns; requirements as to.* ::


a. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision e of this section with respect to taxable periods beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-eight, on or before the twenty-fifth day of September, nineteen hundred sixty-five, and on or before the twenty-fifth day of every month thereafter, every person subject to tax hereunder shall file a return with the commissioner of finance on a form to be prescribed by such commissioner. Such return shall state the gross income or gross operating income as the case may be for the preceding calendar month, and shall contain any other data, information or other matter which the commissioner of finance may require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance may require at any further time a supplemental return hereunder, which shall contain any data upon such matters as such commissioner may specify. Notwithstanding the foregoing and notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision e of this section, a vendor of utility services, all of whose gross operating income is excluded from the measure of the tax imposed by this chapter pursuant to subdivision e of section 11-1102 of this chapter during any taxable period, shall not be required to file a return for such taxable period, provided, however, that on or before the first day of September of each year, any such vendor of utility services who was not required to file a return for any taxable period during the period covered by the statement required to be filed by such date pursuant to subdivision a of section 11-208.1 of this title shall file an information return covering such period in such form and containing such information as the commissioner of finance may specify.

b. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.

c. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face, the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such return or of a corrected return.

d. Where the state tax commission changes or corrects a taxpayer's sales and compensating use tax liability with respect to the purchase or use of items for which a sales or compensating use tax credit against the tax imposed by this chapter was claimed, the taxpayer shall report such change or correction to the commissioner of finance within ninety days of the final determination of such change or correction, or as required by the commissioner of finance, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. Any taxpayer filing an amended return or report with the state tax commission relating to the purchase or use of such items shall also file within ninety days thereafter a copy of such amended return or report with the commissioner of finance.

e. With respect to taxable periods beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-eight, notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision a of this section, if the amount of tax imposed hereunder on any person in the base year does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars, the taxable period for which such person is required to file a return is the semiannual period described in paragraph i of subdivision fourteen of section 11-1101 of this chapter, and such person shall file a return for each semiannual period of the first calendar year beginning after the base year on or before the twenty-fifth day of the month following the end of each such taxable period. Such return shall be filed with the commissioner of finance on a form to be prescribed by such commissioner. Such return shall state the gross income or gross operating income as the case may be for the preceding taxable period and shall contain any other data, information or other matter which the commissioner of finance may require to be included therein. The commissioner of finance may require at any further time a supplemental return hereunder, which shall contain any data upon such matters as such commissioner may specify. For the purposes of this subdivision, if the amount of tax imposed hereunder on such person in the base year is for a period of less than one year, the amount of tax imposed on such person shall be annualized by multiplying the amount of tax imposed by a fraction, the denominator of which is the number of months or parts thereof during which the person was subject to the tax imposed hereunder and the numerator of which is twelve. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subdivision, a person that first becomes subject to the tax hereunder shall file a return for each month in the calendar year in which such person first becomes subject to such tax in accordance with subdivision a of this section.






*§ 11-1105 Payment of tax; credit for certain sales and compensating use taxes.* ::


a. At the time of filing each return, as provided under section 11-1104 of this chapter, each person taxable hereunder shall pay to the commissioner of finance the taxes imposed by this chapter upon its gross income or gross operating income, as the case may be, for the taxable period covered by such return, less any credit to which such person may be entitled under subdivision b of this section. Such taxes shall be due and payable on the last day on which the return for such period is required to be filed, regardless of whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly indicates the amount of tax due.

b. (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the taxes imposed by this chapter for the amount of sales and compensating use taxes imposed by section eleven hundred seven of the tax law which became legally due on or after, and which were paid on or after, July first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven but within the taxable period for which a credit is claimed, with respect to the purchase or use by the taxpayer of machinery or equipment for use or consumption directly and predominantly in the production of steam for sale, by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting, or telephone central office equipment or station apparatus or comparable telegraph equipment for use directly and predominantly in receiving at destination or initiating and switching telephone or telegraph communication, but not including parts with a useful life of one year or less or tools or supplies used in connection with such machinery, equipment or apparatus.

   (2) The amount of the credit provided in paragraph one of this subdivision shall be limited to the amount of such sales and compensating use taxes paid during the taxable period covered by the return under this chapter on which the credit is taken less the amount of any credit or refund of such sales and compensating use taxes during such taxable period. If such credit exceeds the amount of tax under this chapter payable for the taxable period in question, such excess amount shall be refunded or credited except in the case of a vendor of utility services who is entitled to a credit and/or refund for such sales and compensating use taxes under chapter five or six of this title. The credit allowed under this subdivision shall be deemed an erroneous payment of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded in accordance with the provisions of section 11-1108 of this chapter, except as otherwise provided in the previous sentence.

   (3) Where the taxpayer receives a refund or credit of any tax imposed under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law for which the taxpayer has claimed a credit under the provisions of this subdivision in a prior taxable period, the amount of such refund or credit shall be added to the tax imposed by section 11-1102 of this chapter of the taxable period in which such refund or credit of tax under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law is received.






*§ 11-1105.1 Credit for rebates and discounts of charges for energy.* ::

*§ 11-1105.2 Relocation and employment assistance program credit.* ::


(a) A taxpayer that has obtained the certifications required by chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter, provided, however, that a taxpayer that is a vendor of utility services shall not be allowed the credit against the tax imposed by this chapter unless it elects as provided in subdivision (d) of section 22-622 of the code to take the credit against the tax imposed by this chapter. The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying one thousand dollars or, in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two a certification of eligibility dated on or after July first, two thousand, for a relocation to eligible premises located within a revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of section 22-621 of the code, three thousand dollars, by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during the calendar year with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated; provided, however, with respect to a relocation for which no application for a certificate of eligibility is submitted prior to July first, two thousand three, to eligible premises that are within a revitalization area, if the date of such relocation as determined pursuant to subdivision (j) of section 22-621 of the code is on or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, and before July first, two thousand, the amount to be multiplied by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares shall be one thousand dollars; provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for the relocation of any retail activity or hotel services; and provided that in the case of an eligible business that has obtained pursuant to chapter six-B of such title twenty-two certifications of eligibility for more than one relocation, the portion of the total amount of eligible aggregate employment shares to be multiplied by the dollar amount specified in this subdivision for each such certification of a relocation shall be the number of total attributed eligible aggregate employment shares determined with respect to such relocation pursuant to subdivision (o) of section 22-621 of the code. For purposes of this subdivision, the terms "eligible aggregate employment shares", "relocate", "retail activity" and "hotel services" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-621 of the code.

(b) The credit allowed under this subdivision with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to particular premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable periods in the first calendar year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises and for taxable periods in any of the twelve succeeding calendar years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises, provided that the credit allowed for the taxable periods in the twelfth succeeding calendar year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to such premises in the twelfth succeeding calendar year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of relocation less the number of days the eligible business maintained employment shares in the eligible premises in the calendar year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. The credit allowable under this section shall be applied against the amount of tax otherwise required to be paid for the last taxable period of the calendar year as provided in subdivision a of section 11-1105 of this chapter, shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of such section, and shall be claimed on the tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last taxable period in such calendar year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the immediately succeeding taxable periods in the five immediately succeeding calendar years and, to the extent not previously allowable, shall be applied against the tax otherwise required to be paid for such periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of section 11-1105 of this chapter. With respect to the last taxable period in a calendar year, the credit for such calendar year shall be taken prior to any carryover credit. If in any period there are carryover credits available from more than one year, such credits shall be applied against the tax in the order in which they were earned with the oldest available credit being taken first.

(c) In the case of a taxpayer that has obtained a certification of eligibility pursuant to chapter six-B of title twenty-two of the code dated on or after July first, two thousand for a relocation to eligible premises located within the revitalization area defined in subdivision (n) of section 22-621 of the code, the credits allowed under this section, or in the case of a taxpayer that has relocated more than once, the portion of such credits attributed to such certification of eligibility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the calendar year of such relocation and for the four calendar years immediately succeeding the calendar year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be erroneous payments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-1108 of this chapter. For such calendar years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding taxable year; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any relocation for which an application for a certification of eligibility was not submitted prior to July first, two thousand three unless the date of such relocation is on or after July first, two thousand.






*§ 11-1105.3 Lower Manhattan relocation employment assistance credit.* ::

The amount of the credit shall be the amount determined by multiplying three thousand dollars by the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained by the taxpayer during the calendar year with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has relocated; provided, however, that no credit shall be allowed for the relocation of any retail activity or hotel services. For purposes of this subdivision, the terms "eligible aggregate employment shares", "eligible premises", "relocate", "retail activity" and "hotel services" shall have the meanings ascribed by section 22-623 of the code.

(b) The credit allowed under this section with respect to eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises to which the taxpayer has relocated shall be allowed for the taxable period in which the relocation to eligible premises takes place and for succeeding taxable periods in the calendar year of the relocation and in any of the twelve succeeding calendar years during which eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to eligible premises, provided that the credit allowed for the taxable periods in the twelfth succeeding calendar year shall be calculated by multiplying the number of eligible aggregate employment shares maintained with respect to eligible premises in the twelfth succeeding calendar year by the lesser of one and a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year of relocation less the number of days the taxpayer maintained employment shares in eligible premises in the calendar year of relocation and the denominator of which is the number of days in such twelfth succeeding calendar year during which such eligible aggregate employment shares are maintained with respect to such premises. The credit allowable under this section shall be applied against the amount of tax otherwise required to be paid for the last taxable period of the calendar year as provided in subdivision a of section 11-1105 of this chapter, shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of such section but after the credit provided for in section 11-1105.2 of this chapter, and shall be claimed on the tax return for the last taxable period of the calendar year. Except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, if the amount of the credit allowable under this subdivision for any calendar year exceeds the tax imposed for such last taxable period in such calendar year, the excess may be carried over, in order, to the immediately succeeding taxable periods in the five immediately succeeding calendar years and, to the extent not previously allowable, shall be applied against the tax otherwise required to be paid for such periods. Such carryover credit shall be deducted from the taxpayer's tax prior to the deduction of the credit provided in subdivision b of section 11-1105 of this chapter but after the credit provided for in section 11-1105.2 of this chapter. With respect to the last taxable period in a calendar year, the credit for such calendar year shall be taken prior to any carryover credit. If in any period there are carryover credits available from more than one year, such credits shall be applied against the tax in the order in which they were earned with the oldest available credit being taken first.

(c) The credits allowed under this section, against the tax imposed by this chapter for the calendar year of the relocation and for the four taxable years immediately succeeding the calendar year of such relocation, shall be deemed to be overpayments of tax by the taxpayer to be credited or refunded, without interest, in accordance with the provisions of section 11-1108 of this chapter. For such calendar years, such credits or portions thereof may not be carried over to any succeeding calendar year.






*§ 11-1106 Determination of tax.* ::


In case the return required by this chapter shall be insufficient or unsatisfactory or if such return is not filed, the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of the tax due from such information as is obtainable, and if necessary the tax may be estimated upon the basis of external indices. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless such commissioner of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality, unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if instituted by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under such article of such law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall first be deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with such commissioner an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accruee in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-1107 Assessment of tax where change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability involved.* ::


a. If a taxpayer fails to comply with subdivision d of section 11-1104 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction of its sales and compensating use tax liability or in not filing a copy of an amended return or report relating to its sales and compensating use tax liability, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for in section 11-1106 of this chapter, the commissioner of finance may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected sales and compensating use tax liability, as same relates to credits claimed under this chapter, by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the state change or correction or a copy of an amended return or report, where such copy was required, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of determination for the purposes of section 11-1106 of this chapter.

b. If a report filed pursuant to subdivision d of section 11-1104 of this chapter concedes the accuracy of a state change or correction of sales and compensating use tax liability, any deficiency in tax resulting therefor shall be deemed assessed on the date of filing such report.






*§ 11-1108 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if application for such refund shall be made to the commissioner of finance within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three-year period, but is filed within the two-year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, a final determination of tax due was not previously made.

c. If a taxpayer is required by subdivision d of section 11-1104 of this chapter to file a report or amended return in respect of a change or correction of its sales and compensating use tax liability, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within one year from the time such report or amended return was required to be filed with the commissioner of finance. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision.

d. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1106 or 11-1107 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said sections, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1106 or 11-1107 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or of the commissioner of finance's own motion or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-1109 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to him or her on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-1110 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by a declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-1106 of this chapter.






*§ 11-1111 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce payment of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, such commissioner in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which tax or penalties might be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As a further additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and the cost of executing the warrant and to return such warrant to such commissioner and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax and penalties for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall have the full force and effect of a judgment and shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant he or she shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the power conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandising or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof, whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether or not any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give the notice to the commissioner of finance required by this subdivision, or whenever such commissioner shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax is imposed under this chapter.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

*§ 11-1114 Interest and penalties.* ::


(a) Interest on underpayments. If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment.

      (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

   (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on return. In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown (including a determination made pursuant to section 11-1106 of this chapter) within ten days of the date of a notice and demand therefor, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.

   (4) Limitations on additions.

      (A) With respect to any return, the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph (1) shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (1) * which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(c) Underpayment due to negligence.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under subdivision (a) of this section with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph (1) which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph (1), for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (3) If any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine of the internal revenue code of nineteen hundred fifty-four, respectively, and the payee fails to include any portion of such payment in gross income or gross operating income, when required under this chapter to be so included, any portion of an underpayment attributable to such failure shall be treated, for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any penalty is imposed under this subdivision by reason of the preceding sentence, the amount of the penalty imposed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be five percent of the portion of the underpayment which is attributable to the failure described in the preceding sentence.

(d) Underpayment due to fraud. 

   (1) If any part of an underpayment of tax is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax a penalty equal to two times the underpayment.

   (2) [Repealed.]

   (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.

(e) Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(f) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.

(g) (1) Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.

   (2) General rule. The rate of interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.

   (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:

      (A) The federal short-term rate for any month shall be the federal short-term rate determined by the United States secretary of the treasury during such month in acccordance with subsection (d) of section twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal revenue code for use in connection with section six thousand six hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be rounded to the nearest full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate shall be increased to the next highest full percent).

      (B) Period during which rate applies.

         (i) In general. Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first month in each calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning after such month.

         (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with respect to setting the rate of interest for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine.

   (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be published in the city record, and give other appropriate general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no later than twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which such interest rate applies.

(i) Substantial understatement of liability. If there is a substantial understatement of tax for any taxable period, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of this subdivision, there is a substantial understatement of tax for any taxable period if the amount of the understatement for the taxable period exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable period or five thousand dollars. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable period, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return, reduced by any rebate. The amount of such understatement shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return. The commissioner of finance may waive all or any part of the addition to tax provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement (or part thereof) and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.

(j) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents. 

   (1) Any person who, with the intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident to the performance of other services for which such person receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under this title of any return, report, statement or other document which is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, report, statement or other document shall pay a penalty not exceeding ten thousand dollars.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the term "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to do an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person (whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision, or control.

   (3) For purposes of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a person furnishing typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance with respect to a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.

   (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

(k) Failure to include on return information relating to issuer's allocation percentage. Where a return is filed but does not contain (1) the information necessary to compute the taxpayer's issuer's allocation percentage, as defined in subparagraph one of paragraph (b) of subdivision three of section 11-604 of this title, where the same is called for on the return, or, (2) the taxpayer's issuer's allocation percentage, where the same is called for on the return but where all of the information necessary for the computation of such percentage is not called for on the return, then unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect there shall be added to the tax a penalty of five hundred dollars.

(l) False or fraudulent document penalty. Any taxpayer that submits a false or fraudulent document to the department shall be subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars per document submitted, or five hundred dollars per tax return submitted. Such penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty or addition provided by law.






*§ 11-1115 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by him or her, or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action by the city taken to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax imposed under a local law enacted subsequent to July first, nineteen hundred thirty-eight, shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return, provided, however, that where no return has been filed, or where the taxpayer fails to file a report or return in respect of a change or correction in the amount of sales and compensating use tax liability as provided by law, the tax may be assessed at any time. Where the taxpayer files a report or return in respect of a change or correction in sales and compensating use tax liability, as required by subdivision d of section 11-1104, an assessment may be made at any time within two years after such report or return was filed, provided, however, that this sentence shall not affect the time within which an assessment may otherwise be made.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.






*§ 11-1116 Returns to be secret.* ::


a. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, or any officer or employee of the department of finance or the tax appeals tribunal to divulge or make known in any manner, the receipts or any other information relating to the business of a taxpayer contained in any return required under this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city or the commissioner of finance, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events, the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or his or her duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the corporation counsel of the city or other legal representatives of such city of the return of any taxpayer who shall bring action or proceeding to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding has been instituted or is contemplated for the collection of a tax, penalty or interest. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner of finance permits them to be destroyed.

b. (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for a period of five years thereafter.

This chapter shall be construed and enforced in conformity with chapter ninety-three of the laws of nineteen hundred sixty-five, as amended, pursuant to which it is enacted.






*§ 11-1118 Disposition of revenues.* ::


All revenues resulting from the imposition of the tax under this chapter shall be paid into the treasury of the city and shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of the city, but no part of such revenues may be expended unless appropriated in the annual budget of the city.






*§ 11-1119 Determinations of place of primary use of wireless telecommunications services.* ::


a. A home service provider shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining the customer's place of primary use as defined in subdivision twenty of section 11-1101 of this chapter. Except as provided in subdivision b of this section, if the home service provider's reliance on the information provided by its customer is in good faith: (1) the home service provider can rely on the applicable residential or business street address supplied by the home service provider's customer; and (2) the home service provider shall not be held liable for any additional taxes under this chapter based on a different determination of the place of primary use.

b. The commissioner of finance, or the commissioner of taxation and finance of the state of New York on behalf of the commissioner of finance, may determine that the address used by a home service provider for purposes of this chapter does not meet the definition of place of primary use as defined in subdivision twenty of section 11-1101 of this chapter and may give binding notice to the home service provider to change the place of primary use on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination if:

   (1) where the determination is made by the commissioner of finance, such commissioner obtains the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within this state before giving such notice of determination; and

   (2) before the commissioner of finance or the commissioner of taxation and finance of the state of New York gives such notice of determination, the customer is given an opportunity to demonstrate, in accordance with applicable procedures established by the commissioner of finance making the determination, that that address is the customer's place of primary use.

c. Except as provided in subdivision b of this section, a home service provider may treat the address used by the home service provider for purposes of this chapter for the last taxable period beginning before August first, two thousand two, for any customer under a service contract or agreement in effect on July twenty-eighth, two thousand two as that customer's place of primary use for the remaining term of such service contract or agreement, excluding any extension or renewal of such service contract or agreement.






*§ 11-1120 Assignment of place of primary use of telecommunications services to the city.* ::


a. If an electronic database meeting the requirements of 4 U.S.C. § 119(a) is provided by the state of New York, or by a designated database provider as defined in subsection three of section 124 of such title, and the requirements of subsection b of such section 119 are met, a home service provider shall use that database to determine whether the customer's place of primary use is within the territorial limits of the city and shall reflect changes to such database in accordance with subsection c of such section 119.

b. A home service provider using the data contained in an electronic database described in subdivision a of this section shall be held harmless from any tax liability that otherwise would be due under this chapter solely as a result of any error or omission in such database provided the home service provider has properly reflected changes to such database in accordance with 4 U.S.C. § 119(c).

c. (1) If no electronic database is provided as described in subdivision a of this section, a home service provider shall be held harmless from any tax liability under this chapter that otherwise would be due solely as a result of an assignment of a street address to an incorrect taxing jurisdiction if, subject to subdivision d of this section, the home service provider employs an enhanced zip code to assign each street address to a specific taxing jurisdiction for each level of taxing jurisdiction and exercises due diligence at each level of taxing jurisdiction to ensure that each such street address is assigned to the correct taxing jurisdiction. If an enhanced zip code overlaps boundaries of taxing jurisdictions of the same level, the home service provider must designate one specific jurisdiction within such enhanced zip code for use in taxing the activity for such enhanced zip code for each level of taxing jurisdiction. Any enhanced zip code assignment changed in accordance with subdivision d of this section is deemed to be in compliance with this subdivision. For purposes of this subdivision, there is a rebuttable presumption that a home service provider has exercised due diligence if such home service provider demonstrates that it has:

      (i) expended reasonable resources to implement and maintain an appropriately detailed electronic database of street address assignments to taxing jurisdictions;

      (ii) implemented and maintained reasonable internal controls to promptly correct misassignments of street addresses to taxing jurisdictions; and

      (iii) used all reasonably obtainable and usable data pertaining to municipal annexations, incorporations, reorganizations and any other changes in jurisdictional boundaries that materially affect the accuracy of such database.

   (2) Paragraph one of this subdivision applies to a home service provider that is in compliance with the requirements of such paragraph until the later of:

      (i) eighteen months after the nationwide standard numeric code described in 4 U.S.C. § 119(a) has been approved by the federation of tax administrators and the multistate tax commission; or

      (ii) six months after the state of New York or a designated database provider provides a database as prescribed in subdivision a of this section.

d. The commissioner of finance, or the commissioner of taxation and finance of the state of New York on behalf of the commissioner of finance, may determine that the assignment of a street address to a taxing jurisdiction by a home service provider under subdivision c of this section does not reflect the correct taxing jurisdiction and give binding notice to the home service provider to change the assignment on a prospective basis from the date of notice of determination if:

   (1) where the determination is made by the commissioner of finance, such commissioner obtains the consent of all affected taxing jurisdictions within this state before giving such notice of determination; and

   (2) the home service provider is given an opportunity to demonstrate in accordance with applicable procedures established by the commissioner of finance making the determination that the assignment reflects the correct taxing jurisdiction.

Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after giving the notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter.

*§ 11-1207 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally, or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the applicant in writing. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure, pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days of the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to section one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a person liable for the tax, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which has been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1206 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1206 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or of the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-1208 Reserves.* ::

*§ 11-1209 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-1206 and 11-1207 of this chapter shall be exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter, and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a deecision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that such person may proceed by declaratory judgment if such person institutes suit within ninety days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-1206 of this chapter.






*§ 11-1210 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any racing corporation or association or any of its officers or any other person shall fail to collect and pay over any tax or to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as therein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a person subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalties might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the racing corporation or association or its officers or any other person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrants the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which the city sheriff may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever a corporation or association shall make a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk or any part or the whole of its race meeting grounds or enclosures and the building and structures thereon, or its lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such race meeting grounds or enclosures or of the equipment, machinery, fixtures or supplies, or of the said race meeting grounds or enclosures and the building and structures thereon, or lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such race meeting grounds or enclosures, and the equipment, machinery, fixtures or supplies pertaining to the conduct or the operation of the said race meeting grounds or enclosures, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such race meeting grounds or enclosures and the building and structures thereon, or lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such race meeting grounds or enclosures or the equipment, machinery, fixtures or supplies, or of the said race meeting grounds or enclosures and the building and structures thereon, or lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such race meeting grounds or enclosures, and the equipment, machinery, fixtures or supplies or paying thereof, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.






*§ 11-1211 General powers of the commissioner of finance.* ::

1. To make, adopt and amend rules and regulations appropriate to the carrying out of this chapter and the purposes thereof;

Such officers shall be the city sheriff and his or her duly appointed deputies, or any officers or employees of the department of finance or the tax appeals tribunal, designated to serve such process.






*§ 11-1213 Interest and penalties.* ::


(a) Interest on underpayments. If any amount of tax is not paid over or paid on or before the last date prescribed for payment (without regard to any extension of time granted for payment), interest on such amount at the rate set by the commissioner of finance pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section, or, if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date of payment.

For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph (1) of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (1)) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(c) Underpayment due to negligence.

The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the courts may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The commissioner of finance may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any determination or decision rendered after a formal hearing held pursuant to section 11-1206 or 11-1207 of this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or such person's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed by such person nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city, or by the district attorney of any county within the city, of the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding has been instituted for the collection of a tax or penalty.

*§ 11-1215 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by such person or if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section.

Such stamps shall be in the form of a single stamp for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter or, in lieu thereof, a joint single stamp to be prepared and issued by the state of New York and the city for the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter and the taxes imposed by article twenty of the tax law. The commissioner of finance may make such arrangements with the state tax commission for the method of acquiring and the manner of sharing the costs of such joint single stamps as he or she deems appropriate. The commissioner of finance, subject to the approval of the state tax commission, shall make provisions for the sale of such stamps at such places as he or she may deem necessary, and may appoint fiscal agents for such purpose.

b. The commissioner of finance may appoint wholesale dealers of cigarettes and any other person within or without the city as agents to affix stamps to be used in paying the tax hereby imposed, but an agent shall at all times have the right to appoint the person in his or her employ who is to affix the stamps to any cigarettes under the agent's control. Whenever the commissioner of finance shall sell, consign or deliver to any such agent any such stamps, such agent shall be entitled to receive as compensation for his or her services and expenses in affixing such stamps, and to retain out of the moneys to be paid by the agent for such stamps, a commission on the par value thereof. The commissioner of finance is hereby authorized to prescribe a schedule of commissions not exceeding five per centum, allowable to such agent for affixing such stamps; provided, however, that the commissioner of finance may authorize commissions to agents and temporary agents not exceeding ten per centum for a special period not exceeding fifteen days immediately following the enactment of this chapter to cover the initial stamping of packages of cigarettes. Such schedule shall be uniform for each type and denomination of stamp used, and may be on a graduated scale with respect to the number of stamps purchased. In the event that a joint stamp is issued, the commissions allowed shall be determined jointly by the state tax commission and the commissioner of finance and shall be based on the full par value of such stamp. The extent to which the city and the state of New York shall bear the expense of such commissions shall be determined by agreement between the state tax commission and the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance may in his or her discretion permit an agent to pay for such stamps within thirty days after the date of sale, consignment or delivery of such stamps to such agents, and may require any such agent to file with the commissioner of finance a bond, issued by a surety company approved by the superintendent of insurance as to solvency and responsibility and authorized to transact business in the state, in such amounts as the commissioner of finance may fix, to secure the payment of any sums from such agent pursuant to this chapter.

c. The commissioner of finance may redeem unused stamps lawfully in the possession of any person. No person shall sell or offer for sale any stamp issued under this chapter, except by written permission of the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance may prescribe rules and regulations concerning refunds, sales of stamps and redemptions under the provisions of this chapter.

d. (1) Except as provided in this subdivision, it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, possess or transport any affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions.

   (2) Paragraph one of this subdivision shall not apply to:

      (A) a person, other than a retail dealer, in possession of twenty or fewer affixed tax stamps;

      (B) public officers or employees in the performance of their official duties requiring possession or control of affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions; or

      (C) any person authorized by the commissioner of finance or the commissioner of the department of taxation and finance of the state of New York to perform law enforcement functions.






*§ 11-1305 Affixation and cancellation of stamps; presumptions.* ::


a. Each agent shall affix to each package of cigarettes stamps evidencing the payment of tax imposed by this chapter and shall cancel such stamps prior to delivery of such cigarettes to any dealer in the city, unless stamps have been affixed to such packages of cigarettes and cancelled before such agent received them.

b. Each dealer, other than an agent, in the city shall immediately upon the receipt of any cigarettes at his or her place of business mark in ink on each unopened box, carton or other container of such cigarettes the word "received" and the year, month, day and hour of such receipt and shall affix his or her signature thereto or shall mark them in any other manner prescribed by the commissioner of finance. In addition, each retail dealer shall, within twenty-four hours after receipt of any cigarettes at his or her place of business and prior to exposing for sale or sale by such retail dealer of such cigarettes, open such box, carton or other container and, unless such stamps have been previously affixed, immediately notify the dealer from whom he or she purchased such cigarettes and arrange for the replacement by the dealer of such cigarettes by cigarettes with such stamps affixed within twenty-four hours.

c. Stamps shall be cancelled in the manner prescribed by regulation.

d. Whenever any cigarettes are found in the place of business of a dealer without the stamps affixed and cancelled, or not marked as having been received within the preceding twenty-four hours, the prima facie presumption shall arise that such cigarettes are kept therein in violation of the provisions of this chapter.

e. Stamps shall be affixed to each package of cigarettes of an aggregate denomination not less than the amount of the tax upon the contents therein, and shall be affixed in such manner as to be visible to the purchaser.






*§ 11-1306 Possession and transportation of unstamped cigarettes.* ::


Every person who shall possess or transport upon the public highways, roads or streets of this city more than four hundred cigarettes in unstamped packages, shall be required to have in his or her actual possession invoices or delivery tickets for such cigarettes. All such invoices or delivery tickets shall show the true name and address of the consignor or seller, the true name and address of the consignee or purchaser and the quantity and brands of the cigarettes transported. The absence of such invoices or delivery tickets shall be prima facie evidence that such person is a dealer in cigarettes in the city and subject to the provisions of this chapter.






*§ 11-1307 Records to be kept; examination.* ::


a. 1. At the time of delivering cigarettes to any person in the city, each agent or wholesale dealer shall make a true duplicate invoice showing the date of delivery, the number of packages and the number of cigarettes contained therein in each shipment of cigarettes delivered, and the name of the purchaser to whom delivery is made, and shall retain the same for a period of three years subject to the use and inspection of the commissioner of finance.

At the time of delivering tobacco products to any person in the city, each wholesale dealer shall make a true duplicate invoice showing the date of delivery, the number of packages and the number of tobacco products contained therein as well as any tobacco products not in packages in each shipment of tobacco products delivered, and the name of the purchaser to whom delivery is made and shall retain the same for a period of three years subject to the use and inspection of the commissioner of finance. Each dealer shall procure and retain invoices showing the number of packages and the number of tobacco products contained therein as well as any tobacco products not in packages in each shipment of tobacco products received by such dealer, the date thereof, and the name of the shipper, and shall retain the same for a period of three years subject to the use and inspection of the commissioner of finance.

   3. Each dealer shall retain any other records and in such form as may be required by the commissioner of finance indicating proof of the payment of the tax imposed under section 11-1302.1 of this chapter. Any failure to provide such records upon request by the commissioner of finance or such commissioner's duly authorized representatives shall be presumptive evidence that the dealer has violated the provisions of this chapter.

b. The commissioner of finance by regulation may provide that whenever cigarettes or tobacco products are shipped into the city, the railroad company, express company, trucking company, or carrier transporting any shipment thereof shall file with the commissioner of finance a copy of the freight bill within ten days after the delivery in the city of each shipment.

c. All dealers shall maintain and keep for a period of three years such other records of cigarettes or tobacco products received or sold within the city as may be required by the commissioner of finance. All wholesale dealers shall maintain and keep for a period of three years such other records of cigarettes or tobacco products delivered within the city.

d. Without limiting the powers granted the commissioner of consumer affairs pursuant to title 20 and any rules promulgated thereunder, the commissioner of finance or the commissioner's duly authorized representatives are hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, invoices and other records, and stock of cigarettes or tobacco products in and upon any premises where the same are placed, stored and sold, and equipment of any such agent or dealer pertaining to the sale and delivery of cigarettes or tobacco products taxable under this chapter. To verify the accuracy of the tax imposed and assessed by this chapter, each such person is hereby directed and required to give to the commissioner of finance or the commissioner's duly authorized representatives, the means, facilities and opportunity for such examinations as are herein provided for and required.

e. The commissioner of finance shall investigate any failure to pay the tax required by this chapter or any other failure to comply with this chapter or the rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, and shall take the necessary steps to enforce compliance therewith.

*§ 11-1310 Determination of tax.* ::


If any person fails to pay the tax, or to file a return required by this chapter, or if a return, when filed, is insufficient and the maker fails to file a corrected or sufficient return within ten days after the same may be required by notice from the commissioner of finance, the commissioner of finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as may be obtainable or on the basis of external indices, such as number of cigarettes purchased or sold, number of tobacco products purchased or sold, stock on hand, volume of sales by similar dealers and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within ninety days of the giving of such notice, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the person liable for the tax has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance shall of his or her own motion redetermine such tax. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of this charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person liable for the tax and to the commissioner of finance.

Such proceeding shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall have first been deposited with the commissioner of finance and an undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.








*§ 11-1311 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this subdivision the commissioner of finance shall refund, without interest, any tax, interest or penalty erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid. In addition, whenever any cigarettes upon which stamps have been affixed have been sold and shipped to a dealer outside the city for sale there or to any person in another state for use there, or have become unfit for use and consumption or unsalable, or have been destroyed, the dealer shall be entitled to a refund of the amount of tax paid, less the applicable commission, with respect to such cigarettes. In any event no refund shall be granted unless application to the commissioner of finance therefor is made within two years after the stamps were affixed to such cigarettes or the tax was paid, except if a person has consented in writing to an extension of the period for assessment of additional tax pursuant to subdivision c of section 11-1315, and such consent is given within the two-year period for making a refund application provided in this subdivision, the period for making a refund application shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment could be made pursuant to such consent or any extension thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor and give notice thereof to the applicant in writing. A person shall not be entitled to a hearing in connection with such application for a refund if such person has already had a hearing or had been given the opportunity of a hearing as provided in section 11-1310 or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the commissioner of finance as provided in section 11-1310, unless the tax appeals tribunal, after a hearing as in said section provided or the commissioner of finance, of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty, or it shall have been established in a proceeding, pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules that such determination was erroneous, illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise improper, in which event a refund without interest shall be made as provided upon the determination of such proceeding. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund pursuant to this subdivision shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund made as provided in this subdivision shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to maintain a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, provided, however, that such proceeding is instituted within four months after such decision, provided however, that if such decision regards the tax imposed under section 11-1302.1, such proceeding must be instituted within thirty days after such decision, and provided, further, in the case of an application by a person liable for the tax, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made, and that an undertaking shall first be filed by such person with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

b. If the commissioner of finance is satisfied that any dealer is entitled to a refund the commissioner shall issue to such dealer stamps of sufficient value to cover the refund or to make such refund.








*§ 11-1312 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has instituted proceedings under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to the taxpayer on his or her application for refund or has deposited the amount of tax assessed in connection with proceedings under section 11-1310 of this chapter, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-1313 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-1310 and 11-1311 of this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on an application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received, or by any legal or equitable action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if the taxpayer institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-1310 of this chapter.






*§ 11-1314 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax, interest or penalties might be satisfied and that any such tax, interest or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax, interest or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. In addition to all other remedies for the collection of any taxes, penalties or interest due under the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner of finance may with respect to any tax imposed under section 11-1302 or any penalties or interest related thereto issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the taxes, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.








*§ 11-1315 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by such person or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax, interest or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return, provided, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a person has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal is authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

a. (1) Any person failing to pay a tax payable under section 11-1302 when due shall be subject to a penalty of fifty per centum of the amount of tax due, but the commissioner of finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter. Unpaid penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by section 11-1302.

   (2) Any person failing to pay a tax payable under section 11-1302.1 when due shall be subject to a penalty of three hundred per centum of the amount of tax due, but the commissioner of finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from the tax imposed under section 11-1302.1. Unpaid penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by section 11-1302.1.

b. (1) In addition to any other penalty imposed by this section, the commissioner of finance may (a) impose a penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes or fraction thereof in excess of one thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages in the possession or under the control of any person and (b) impose a penalty of not more than two hundred dollars for each ten affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions, or fraction thereof, in excess of one hundred affixed or unaffixed false, altered or counterfeit cigarette tax stamps, imprints or impressions in the possession or under the control of any person. Such penalty shall be determined as provided in section 11-1310 of this chapter, and may be reviewed only pursuant to such section. Such penalty may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter. The commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may remit all or part of such penalty. Such penalty shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues under this chapter.

   (2) The penalties imposed by this paragraph may be imposed by the commissioner of finance in addition to any other penalty imposed by this section, but in lieu of the penalties imposed by subparagraph (a) of paragraph one of this subdivision: (a) not less than thirty dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of one thousand cigarettes but less than or equal to five thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control of any person; (b) not less than seventy-five dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of five thousand cigarettes but less than or equal to twenty thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control of any person; and (c) not less than one hundred dollars but not more than two hundred dollars for each two hundred cigarettes, or fraction thereof, in excess of twenty thousand cigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages, knowingly in the possession or knowingly under the control of any person.

Such application may be made by the transferee or transferor who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing.

Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1406 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1406 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing, or on the commissioner's own motion, or, is* such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to be overpaid.






*§ 11-1408 Reserves.* ::

*§ 11-1409 Remedies exclusive.* ::

*§ 11-1410 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any transferee or transferor shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such transferee or transferor subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, the commissioner may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the transferee or transferor or other person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk or any part of the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing.

d. Whenever, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the preceding subdivision, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

e. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more.

*§ 11-1415 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, in any application made by such person, or in the records maintained by the taxi and limousine commission, or, if no return has been filed or application made or address found in the records of the taxi and limousine commission, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

(1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

*§ 11-1611 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor in writing. Such application may be made by the seller or supplier or the retailer or other person who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. An application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. If the commissioner of finance, prior to any hearing held, initially denies the application for refund, the commissioner shall give notice of such determination of denial to the applicant. Such determination shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant, within thirty days after the giving of notice of such determination, shall apply to the commissioner of finance for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. After such hearing the commissioner of finance shall give notice of his or her determination to the applicant, who shall be entitled to review such determination by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such determination, and provided that a final determination of tax was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner shall pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1610 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-1609 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the commissioner of finance after a hearing or of the commissioner's own motion, or in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-1612 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the seller or supplier or the retailer has applied for a fund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to him or her on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-1613 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-1610 and 11-1611 of this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if such taxpayer institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-1610 of this chapter.






*§ 11-1614 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any seller or supplier or retailer or other person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as therein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such seller or supplier or retailer or other person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax, penalties or interest might be satisfied, and that any such tax, penalty or interest will not be paid when due, the commissioner of finance may declare such tax, penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the city sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the seller or supplier or retailer or other person liable for the tax, which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner of finance the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant to docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant the city sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever a seller or supplier or the retailer shall make a sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of any part of the whole of his or her fixtures, or of his or her stock of merchandise, or of stock or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conduct or operation of business of the seller or supplier or the retailer, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and regular prosecution of business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of the subject of said sale, transfer or assignment, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the proceeding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim.

The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

Such penalties and interest shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid penalties and interest may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.

b. Any seller or supplier or any retailer or any officer of a corporate seller or supplier or retailer, failing to file a return as required by this chapter, or filing or causing to be filed or making or causing to be made or given or causing to be given any return, certificate, affidavit, representation, information, testimony or statement required or authorized by this chapter which is willfully false, and any seller or supplier or any retailer or any officer of a corporate seller or supplier or retailer failing to keep the records required by subdivision six of section 11-1602 of this chapter, shall, in addition to the penalties herein or elsewhere prescribed, be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishment for which shall be a fine of not more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.

*§ 11-1616 Return to be secret.* ::


a. Except in accordance with proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner of finance, any officer or employee of the department of finance, any person engaged or retained on an independent contract basis or any person who, pursuant to this section is permitted to inspect any return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner any information contained in or relating to any return required under this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or such taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with such taxpayer's tax; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information contained in or relating thereto, the United States of America or any department thereof, to the state of New York or any department thereof, or to any agency or department of the city of New York, provided the same is requested for official business; nor to prohibit the inspection for official business of such returns by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the district attorney of any county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner of finance permits them to be destroyed.

Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by such person pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by such person or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

(b) The additional tax imposed pursuant to this section shall be administered, collected and distributed by the commissioner of taxation and finance in the same manner as the other taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter, and all of the provisions of this chapter, including sections 11-1706, 11-1721 and 11-1773, shall apply to the additional tax imposed by this section.








*§ 11-1705 General provisions and definitions.* ::


(a) Accounting periods and methods.

   (1) Accounting periods. A taxpayer's taxable year under this chapter shall be the same as his taxable year for federal income tax purposes.

   (2) Change of accounting periods. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax purposes, his taxable year for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed. If a taxable year of less than twelve months results from a change of a taxable year, the city standard deduction and the city exemptions shall be prorated under regulations of the tax commission.

   (3) Accounting methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this chapter shall be the same as his method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. In the absence of any method of accounting for federal income tax purposes, city taxable income shall be computed under such method as in the opinion of the tax commission clearly reflects income.

   (4) Change of accounting methods.

      (A) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes, his method of accounting for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed.

      (B) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other than from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax which results from adjustments determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change shall not be greater than if such adjustments were ratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the preceding taxable years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change is made.

      (C) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations of the tax commission.

(b) City resident and city nonresident defined. 

   (1) City resident individual. A city resident individual means an individual:

      (A) who is domiciled in this city, unless (i) the taxpayer maintains no permanent place of abode in this city, maintains a permanent place of abode elsewhere, and spends in the aggregate not more than thirty days of the taxable year in this city, or (ii) (I) within any period of five hundred forty-eight consecutive days the taxpayer is present in a foreign country or countries for at least four hundred fifty days, and (II) during the period of five hundred forty-eight consecutive days the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse (unless the spouse is legally separated) and the taxpayer's minor children are not present in this city for more than ninety days, and (III) during any period of less than twelve months, which would be treated as a separate taxable period pursuant to section 11-1754, and which period is contained within the period of five hundred forty-eight consecutive days, the taxpayer is present in this city for a number of days which does not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to ninety as the number of days contained in that period of less than twelve months bears to five hundred forty-eight, or

      (B) who maintains a permanent place of abode in this city and spends in the aggregate more than one hundred eighty-three days of the taxable year in this city, whether or not domiciled in this city for any portion of the taxable year, unless such individual is in active service in the armed forces of the United States.

   (2) City nonresident individual. A city nonresident individual means an individual who is not a city resident.

   (3) City resident estate or trust. A city resident estate or trust means:

      (A) the estate of a decedent who at his death was domiciled in this city,

      (B) a trust, or a portion of a trust, consisting of property transferred by will of a decedent who at his death was domiciled in this city, or

      (C) a trust, or portion of a trust, consisting of the property of:

         (i) a person domiciled in this city at the time such property was transferred to the trust, if such trust or portion of a trust was then irrevocable, or if it was then revocable and has not subsequently become irrevocable; or

         (ii) a person domiciled in this city at the time such trust, or portion of a trust, became irrevocable, if it was revocable when such property was transferred to the trust but has subsequently become irrevocable. For the purposes of the foregoing, a trust or portion of a trust is revocable if it is subject to a power, exercisable immediately or at any future time, to revest title in the person whose property constitutes such trust or portion of a trust, and a trust or portion of a trust becomes irrevocable when the possibility that such power may be exercised has been terminated.

   (4) City nonresident estate or trust. A city nonresident estate or trust means an estate or trust which is not a city resident estate or trust.

   (5) Cross-reference. For effect of a change of resident status, see section 11-1754.

(D) (i) Provided, however, a resident trust is not subject to tax under this article if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

      (I) all the trustees are domiciled outside the city of New York;

      (II) the entire corpus of the trusts, including real and tangible property, is located outside the city of New York; and

      (III) all income and gains of the trust are derived from or connected with sources outside of the city of New York, determined as if the trust were a non-resident trust.

   (ii) For purposes of item (II) of clause (i) of this subparagraph, intangible property shall be located in this city if one or more of the trustees are domiciled in the city of New York.

   (iii) Provided further, that for the purposes of item (I) of clause (i) of this subparagraph, a trustee which is a banking corporation as defined in subdivision (a) of section 11-640 of this title and which is domiciled outside the city of New York at the time it becomes a trustee of the trust shall be deemed to continue to be a trustee domiciled outside the city of New York notwithstanding that it thereafter otherwise becomes a trustee domiciled in the city of New York by virtue of being acquired by, or becoming an office or branch of, a corporate trustee domiciled within the city of New York.

   (3) For purposes of this subsection:

      (A) "Household gross income" shall mean the aggregate federal adjusted gross income of a household, as the term household is defined in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, for the taxable year.

      (B) "Household" means a husband and wife, a head of household, a surviving spouse, or an individual who is not married nor the head of a household nor a surviving spouse nor a taxpayer with respect to whom a deduction under subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.

      (C) "Household gross income of a husband and wife" shall be the aggregate of their federal adjusted gross incomes for the taxable year irrespective of whether joint or separate city income tax returns are filed. Provided, however, that a husband or wife who is required to file a separate city income tax return shall be permitted one-half the credit otherwise allowed his or her household, except as limited by paragraph one of this subdivision.

      (D) "Household gross income" shall be computed in all cases as if each member of the household were a resident for the entire taxable year.

      (E) If a taxpayer changes his status during his taxable year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the household credit shall be prorated according to the number of months in the period of residence. In the case of a husband and wife, if either or both changes his or her status from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident and separate returns are filed, the credit computed for the entire year shall be divided first as provided in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph and then prorated according to the number of months in the period of residence.

(c)*    State school tax reduction credit.

Editor's note: there are two divisions designated (c) in this section.

   (1) For taxable years beginning after nineteen hundred ninety-seven and ending before two thousand sixteen, a state school tax reduction credit shall be allowed as provided in the following tables. The credit shall be allowed against the taxes authorized by this article reduced by the credits permitted by this article. If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may receive, and the comptroller, subject to a certificate of the commissioner, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the amount of such excess. For purposes of this subsection, no credit shall be granted to an individual with respect to whom a deduction under subsection (c) of section one hundred fifty-one of the internal revenue code is allowable to another taxpayer for the taxable year.

   (2) The amount of the credit under this paragraph shall be determined based upon the taxpayer's income as defined in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of subdivision four of section four hundred twenty-five of the real property tax law. For purposes of this paragraph, any taxpayer under subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph with income of more than two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall not receive a credit. Beginning in the two thousand ten tax year and each tax year thereafter through two thousand fifteen, the "more than two hundred fifty thousand dollar" income limitation shall be adjusted by applying the inflation factor set forth herein, and rounding each result to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars. The department shall establish the income limitation to be associated with each subsequent tax year by applying the inflation factor set forth herein to the figures that define the income limitation that were applicable to the preceding tax year, as determined pursuant to this subsection, and rounding each result to the nearest multiple of one hundred dollars. Such determination shall be made no later than March first, two thousand ten and each year thereafter.

      (A) Married individuals filing joint returns and surviving spouses. In the case of a husband and wife who make a single return jointly and of a surviving spouse:

   (3) [Reserved.]

   (4) Husband and wife who make a joint return. If a husband and wife make a single return jointly, the credit under this subdivision shall be determined under paragraph two of this subdivision, if either of them has attained the age of sixty-five on or before the close of the taxable year.

   (5) Part-year residents. If a taxpayer changes status during the taxable year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, the state school tax reduction credit shall be prorated according to the number of months in the period of residence.

(c)*   Credit for unincorporated business taxes paid. 

Editor's note: there are two divisions designated (c) in this section.

   (1) A city resident individual, estate or trust whose city adjusted gross income includes income, gain, loss or deductions from one or more unincorporated businesses conducted by such city resident individual, estate or trust that are subject to the tax imposed by chapter five of this title, or a distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, or guaranteed payments from, one or more partnerships that are subject to the tax imposed by such chapter, shall be allowed a credit as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision against the tax otherwise due under sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1 of this chapter.

   (2) (A)    Subject to the limitation set forth in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the credit allowed to a taxpayer for a taxable year under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:

         (i) For taxable years beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred ninety-seven:

            (I) If the city taxable income is forty-two thousand dollars or less, the credit shall be sixty-five percent of the amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.

            (II) If the city taxable income is greater than forty-two thousand dollars but not greater than one hundred forty-two thousand dollars, the amount of the credit shall be a percentage of the amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision, such percentage to be determined by subtracting from sixty-five percent, one-tenth of a percentage point (.001) for every increment of two hundred dollars, or fractional part thereof, of city taxable income in excess of forty-two thousand dollars.

            (III) If the city taxable income is greater than one hundred forty-two thousand dollars, the credit shall be fifteen percent of the amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.

      (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the credit allowed to a taxpayer for a taxable year under this subdivision shall not exceed the sum of the taxes that would otherwise be imposed by sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1 of this chapter on such taxpayer for such taxable year after the allowance of any other credits allowed by this section or section 11-1721 of this chapter.

   (3) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (C) of this paragraph, the amount determined in this paragraph is the sum of:

      (A) for each unincorporated business conducted by the taxpayer, the tax imposed by chapter five of this title on such unincorporated business for its taxable year ending with the taxable year of the taxpayer and paid by the unincorporated business; and

      (B) for each unincorporated business in which the taxpayer is a partner, the product of:

         (i) the sum of (I) the tax imposed by chapter five of this title on such unincorporated business for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner and paid by the unincorporated business and (II) the amount of any credit or credits taken by the unincorporated business under subdivision (j) of section 11-503 of this title for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the partner; and

         (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the net total of the partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business for such taxable year, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such taxable year, of the net total distributive shares of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments to, all partners in the unincorporated business for whom or which such net total (as separately determined for each partner) is greater than zero.

      (C) For a taxpayer that changes its status from a city resident to a city nonresident or from a city nonresident to a city resident during the taxable year:

         (i) the amount determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be, with respect to each unincorporated business conducted by the taxpayer, the tax imposed by chapter five of this title on such unincorporated business for its taxable year ending with the taxable year of the taxpayer and paid by the unincorporated business, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of the income, gain, loss and deductions of the unincorporated business included in the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the portion of the taxable year during which the taxpayer was a city resident, and the denominator of which is the total, for such taxable year, of the income, gain, loss and deductions of the unincorporated business, and

         (ii) the amount determined in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be a fraction, the numerator of which is that portion of the taxpayer's net total distributive share of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and that portion of guaranteed payments from, the unincorporated business included in the taxpayer's city adjusted gross income for the portion of the taxable year during which the taxpayer was a city resident, and the denominator of which is the sum, for such taxable year, of the net total distributive shares of income, gain, loss and deductions of, and guaranteed payments to, all partners in the unincorporated business, for whom or which such net total (as separately determined for each partner) is greater than zero.

   (4) For purposes of subdivision (c) of section 11-1902 of this title, in determining the amount of tax that a nonresident would be required to pay if such nonresident were a resident of the city and subject to the tax on personal income of residents, the credit allowed by this subdivision shall be taken into account.

(d) Earned income tax credit.

   (1)    For taxable years beginning after two thousand three, a credit against the city personal income tax shall be allowed, equal to five percent of the earned income credit allowed under section thirty-two of the internal revenue code for the same taxable year.

   (2) In the case of a resident taxpayer, the credit provided by this subdivision shall be allowed against the taxes authorized by this chapter for the taxable year reduced by the credits permitted by this chapter. If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may receive, and the state comptroller, subject to a certificate of the commissioner of the state department of taxation and finance, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the amount of such excess.

   (3) If a taxpayer changes his or her status during the taxable year from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the credit determined under this subdivision shall be limited to the amount determined by multiplying the amount of such credit by a fraction, the numerator of which is such taxpayer's city adjusted gross income, for the period of residence, and the denominator of which is such taxpayer's city adjusted gross income determined as if he or she were a city resident for the entire taxable year. City adjusted gross income shall be adjusted as provided in section 11-1754 of this chapter. The credit as so limited shall be applied as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision.

   (4) Subject to the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision, in the case of a husband and wife who file a joint return, but who are required to determine their city personal income taxes separately, the credit authorized pursuant to this subdivision may be applied against the tax of either or divided between them as they may elect. In the case of a husband and wife who are not required to file a federal return, the credit under this subsection shall be allowed only if such taxpayers file a joint city personal income tax return.

   (5) If the state commissioner of taxation and finance determines that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the credit provided under this subdivision but has not claimed such credit on his or her return, the state commissioner of taxation and finance shall compute and issue any refund for the allowable credit amount provided under this subdivision. Any refund paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be deemed to be a refund of an overpayment of tax as provided in section 11-1786 of this title, provided, however, that no interest shall be paid thereon.

(e) Credit for certain household and dependent care services necessary for gainful employment.

   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand seven, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit as provided herein equal to the applicable percentage of the credit allowed under subsection (c) of section six hundred six of the tax law with respect to qualifying individuals as defined in paragraph one of subsection (b) of section twenty-one of the internal revenue code (without regard to whether the taxpayer in fact claimed the credit under such section twenty-one for the taxable year) who are dependents of the taxpayer and who have not attained the age of four as of the end of the taxable year. The applicable percentage shall be determined as follows:

      (A) If household gross income as defined in subparagraph (A) of paragraph three of subdivision (b) of this section is twenty-five thousand dollars or less, the applicable percentage shall be seventy-five percent.

      (B) If such household gross income is greater than twenty-five thousand dollars but not greater than thirty thousand dollars, the applicable percentage shall be seventy-five percent multiplied by one minus a fraction, the numerator of which is such household gross income less twenty-five thousand dollars and the denominator of which is five thousand dollars.

      (C) If such household gross income is greater than thirty thousand dollars, the applicable percentage shall be zero.

   (2) The credit under this subdivision shall be allowed against the taxes imposed by this chapter reduced by the credits permitted by this chapter. If the credit exceeds the tax as so reduced, the taxpayer may receive, and the state comptroller, subject to the certificate of the state commissioner of taxation and finance, shall pay as an overpayment, without interest, the amount of such excess, provided, however, in the case of a taxpayer who is a part-year resident of New York city any such overpayment under this paragraph shall be limited to the amount of such excess multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is federal adjusted gross income for the period of residence, computed as if the taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the period of residence, and the denominator of which is federal adjusted gross income for the taxable year.

   (3) In the case of a husband and wife who filed a joint federal return, but who are required to determine their New York city taxes separately, the credit allowed pursuant to this subdivision may only be applied against the tax imposed on the spouse with the lower taxable income, computed without regard to such credit, provided, however, if the spouse with the lower taxable income is a nonresident of the city, no credit shall be allowed under this subdivision. In the case of a husband and wife who are not required to file a federal return, the credit under this subdivision shall be allowed only if such taxpayers file a joint New York city income tax return.

(f) Credit for general corporation tax paid.

   (1)    A city resident individual, estate or trust whose city adjusted gross income includes a pro rata share of income, loss and deductions described in paragraph one of subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code, from one or more New York S corporations as defined in subdivision one-A of section two hundred eight of the tax law, or from one or more QSSSs as defined in subdivision one-B of section two hundred eight of the tax law, that are exempt QSSSs by reason of clause (A) of subparagraph one of paragraph (k) of subdivision nine of section two hundred eight of the tax law, on which a tax is imposed by subchapter two of chapter six of this title, shall be allowed a credit as provided in paragraph two of this subdivision against the tax otherwise due under sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1 of this chapter.

   (2) (A) Subject to the limitations set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph, the credit allowed to a taxpayer for a taxable year under this subdivision shall be determined as follows:

         (i)    For taxable years beginning on or after January first, two thousand fourteen and before July first, two thousand nineteen:

            (I) If the city taxable income is thirty-five thousand dollars or less, the amount of the credit shall be one hundred percent of the amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision.

            (II) If the city taxable income is greater than thirty-five thousand dollars but less than one hundred thousand dollars, the amount of the credit shall be a percentage of the amount determined in paragraph three of this subdivision, such percentage to be determined by subtracting from one hundred percent, a percentage determined by subtracting thirty-five thousand dollars from city taxable income, dividing the result by sixty-five thousand dollars and multiplying by one hundred percent.

            (III) If the city taxable income is one hundred thousand dollars or greater, no credit shall be allowed.

            (IV) Provided further that for any taxable year of a taxpayer for which this credit is effective that encompasses days occurring after June thirtieth, two thousand nineteen, the amount of the credit determined in item (I) or (II) of this clause shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxpayer's taxable year occurring on or before June thirtieth, two thousand nineteen, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the taxpayer's taxable year.

      (B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the credit allowed to a taxpayer for a taxable year under this subdivision shall not exceed the sum of the taxes that would otherwise be imposed by sections 11-1701, 11-1703, 11-1704 and 11-1704.1 of this chapter on such taxpayer for such taxable year after the allowance of any other credits allowed by subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, and subdivision (c) of this section, as added by chapter four hundred eighty-one of the laws of nineteen hundred ninety-seven and subsequently amended, and section 11-1721 of this chapter.

      (C) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, no credit shall be allowed for any amount of tax imposed, or credit allowed, by subchapter two of chapter six of this title on, or to, a combined group of corporations including a New York S corporation or an exempt QSSS, except where the combined group consists exclusively of one or more New York S corporations and one or more exempt QSSSs of such corporations as described in paragraph one of this subdivision, provided that each of the New York S corporations included in the group is wholly owned by the same interests and in the same proportions as each other New York S corporation included in the group.

   (3) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and subparagraph (C) of paragraph two of this subdivision, the amount determined in this paragraph is the sum of the taxpayer's pro rata share of the amounts determined in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for each New York S corporation, or exempt QSSS, described in paragraph one of this subsection, a pro rata share of whose income, loss and deductions described in paragraph one of subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code, is included in the taxpayer's city adjusted gross income.

      (A) The amount determined in this subparagraph is the sum of:

         (i) the taxes imposed by subchapter two of chapter six of this title on such corporation, or a combined group including such corporation, for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the taxpayer and paid by such corporation, or combined group; and

         (ii) the amount of any credit or credits taken by such corporation, or a combined group including such corporation, under subdivision eighteen of section 11-604 of this title for its taxable year ending within or with the taxable year of the taxpayer.

      (B) For purposes of this subdivision, the taxpayer's pro rata share of the amount in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for the taxable year shall be the amount determined with respect to the taxpayer:

         (i) by assigning an equal portion of the amount in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to each day of the corporation's taxable year on which the corporation has shares outstanding,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum of disability income excluded pursuant to this paragraph, and pension and annuity income excluded pursuant to paragraph three-a of this subdivision, shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars.

      (ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (f) of this section, if a husband and wife determine their federal income tax on a joint return but are required to determine their city income taxes separately, the amounts of exclusion allowed under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be determined in the same joint manner as such amounts would have been determined under the provisions of paragraph five of subsection (d) of section one hundred five of the internal revenue code as such provisions were in effect immediately prior to the repeal of such subsection, but shall be attributed for city income tax purposes to the spouse who would have been required to report any such amount as income if the spouses had determined their federal income taxes separately.

      (iii) Where a husband and wife file a joint city income tax return, the twenty thousand dollar limitation provided in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be applied as if they were filing separate city income tax returns.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the words "active service in the armed forces of the United States" shall mean active duty (other than for training) in the army, navy (including the marine corps), air force or coast guard of the United States as defined in Title 10 of the United States Code.

   (3) For purposes of this paragraph, such modifications shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or business: (A) constructed, reconstructed or erected after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven or which began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this state and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, or (C) acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, if such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven and not thereafter substantially modified, and such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection would qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subdivision (h) of section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references in such paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clause (A), (B) or (C) of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-nine, except in the case of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer. However, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a modification under paragraph one of this subdivision with respect to tangible personal property leased to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which a taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, a modification under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be allowed in proportion to the part of the year such property is used by the taxpayer.

   (4) For purposes of this paragraph, such modifications shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is depreciable pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or business. The modifications provided for in paragraph one of this subdivision shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property which is: (A) constructed, reconstructed or erected after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or, property, the physical construction, reconstruction or erection of which began on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight or which began after such date pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and at all times thereafter, binding on the taxpayer or pursuant to an order placed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this state and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, or (C) acquired, constructed, reconstructed, or erected subsequent to December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, if such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection is pursuant to a plan of the taxpayer which was in existence December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and not thereafter substantially modified, and such acquisition, construction, reconstruction or erection would qualify under the rules in paragraph four, five or six of subdivision (h) of section forty-eight of the internal revenue code provided all references in such paragraphs four, five and six to the dates October nine, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and October ten, nineteen hundred sixty-six, shall be read as December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight. A taxpayer shall be allowed a deduction under clause (A), (B) or (C) of the preceding sentence of this paragraph only if the tangible property shall be delivered or the construction, reconstruction or erection shall be completed on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred seventy, except in the case of tangible property which is acquired, constructed, reconstructed or erected pursuant to a contract which was, on or before December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, and at all times thereafter binding on the taxpayer. The modification provided for in paragraph two of this subdivision shall be allowed only with respect to tangible property: (A) the construction, reconstruction or erection of which is completed after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and then only with respect to that portion of the basis thereof or the expenditures relating thereto which is properly attributable to such construction, reconstruction or erection after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three, or (B) acquired after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, by purchase as defined in section one hundred seventy-nine (d) of the internal revenue code, if the original use of such property commenced with the taxpayer, commenced in this state and commenced after December thirty-first, nineteen hundred sixty-three. Provided, however, a modification under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be allowed with respect to property described in this paragrpah only on condition that such property shall be principally used by the taxpayer in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assemblying; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture; or commerical fishing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, manufacturing shall mean the process of working raw materials into wares suitable for use or which gives new shapes, new qualities or new combinations to matter which already has gone through some artificial process by the use of machinery, tools, appliances and other similar equipment. Property used in the production of goods shall include machinery, equipment or other tangible property which is principally used in the repair and service of other machinery, equipment or other tangible property used principally in the production of goods and shall include all facilities used in the manufacturing operation, including storage of material to be used in manufacturing and of the products that are manufactured. At the option of the taxpayer, air and water pollution control facilities which qualify for elective deductions under subdivision (h) of this section may be treated, for purposes of this paragraph, as tangible property principally used in the production of goods by manufacturing; processing; assembling; refining; mining; extracting; farming; agriculture; horticulture; floriculture; viticulture; or commercial fishing, in which event, a deduction shall not be allowed under such subdivision (h). However, for any taxable year beginning on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-eight, a taxpayer shall not be allowed a modification under paragraph one of this subdivision with respect to tangible personal property leased to any other person or corporation. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any contract or agreement to lease or rent or for a license to use such property shall be considered a lease. With respect to property which a taxpayer uses for purposes other than leasing for part of a taxable year and leases for a part of a taxable year, a modification under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be allowed in proportion to the part of the year such property is used by the taxpayer.

   (5) If the modifications allowable for any taxable year pursuant to this subdivision exceed the taxpayer's city adjusted gross income, determined without the allowance of such modifications, the excess may be carried over to the following taxable year or years and may be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income for such year or years.

   (6) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a modification has been allowed pursuant to paragraph one or two of this subdivision, the basis of such property shall be adjusted to reflect the modifications so allowed, and if the basis as so adjusted is lower than the adjusted basis of the same property for federal income tax purposes, there shall be added to federal adjusted gross income the amount of the difference between such adjusted bases.

(h) Optional modification for waste treatment facility expenditures. For taxable years commencing prior to January first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine, at the election of the taxpayer, there shall also be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income expenditures paid or incurred during the taxable year for the construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of industrial waste treatment facilities and air pollution control facilities.

   (1) (A) The term "industrial waste treatment facilities" shall mean facilities for the treatment, neutralization, or stabilization of industrial waste (as the term "industrial waste" is defined in section 17-0105 of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately preceding the point of such treatment, neutralization or stabilization to the point of disposal, including the necessary pumping and transmitting facilities, but excluding such facilities installed for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable.

      (B) The term "air pollution control facilities" shall mean facilities which remove, reduce, or render less noxious air contaminants emitted from an air contamination source (as the terms "air contaminant" and "air contamination source" are defined in section 19-0107 of the environmental conservation law) from a point immediately preceding the point of such removal, reduction or rendering to the point of discharge of air, meeting emission standards as established by the air pollution control board, but excluding such facilities installed for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable and excluding those facilities which rely for their efficacy on dilution, dispersion or assimilation of air contaminants in the ambient air after emission.

   (2) Such modifications shall be allowed only:

      (A) with respect to tangible property which is depreciable, pursuant to section one hundred sixty-seven of the internal revenue code, having a situs in this state and used in the taxpayer's trade or business, the construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of which, in the case of industrial waste treatment facilities, is initiated on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-five, or which, in the case of air pollution control facilities, is initiated on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and

      (B) on condition that such facilities have been certified by the commissioner of environmental conservation or his or her designated representative, in the same manner as provided for in section 17-0707 or 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, as applicable, as complying with the provisions of such environmental conservation law, the state sanitary code and regulations, permits or orders promulgated pursuant thereto, and

      (C) on condition that for the taxable year and all succeeding taxable years, any deductions allowed for federal income tax purposes for such expenditures or for depreciation or amortization of the same property, except to the extent that its basis may be attributable to factors other than such expenditures, be added to federal adjusted gross income pursuant to paragraph five of subdivision (b) of this section, or in case a modification is allowable pursuant to this paragraph for only a part of such expenditures, on condition that a proportionate amount of any such deductions allowed for federal income tax purposes be added to federal adjusted gross income, and

      (D) where the election provided for in subdivision (g) of this section has not been exercised in respect to the same property.

   (3) (A) If expenditures in respect to an industrial waste treatment facility or an air pollution control facility have been allowed as a modification as provided herein and if within ten years from the end of the taxable year in which such modification was allowed such property or any part thereof is used for the primary purpose of salvaging materials which are usable in the manufacturing process or are marketable, the taxpayer shall report such change of use in its return for the first taxable year during which it occurs, and the tax commission may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such modification was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.

      (B) If a modification is allowed as herein provided for expenditures paid or incurred during any taxable year on the basis of a temporary certificate of compliance issued pursuant to the environmental conservation law, and if the taxpayer fails to obtain a permanent certificate of compliance upon completion of the facilities with respect to which such temporary certificate was issued, the taxpayer shall report such failure in its report for the taxable year during which such facilities are completed, and the tax commission may recompute the tax for the year or years for which such modification was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.

      (C) If a modification is allowed as herein provided for expenditures paid or incurred during any taxable year in respect to an air pollution control facility on the basis of a certificate of compliance issued pursuant to the environmental conservation law and the certificate is revoked pursuant to section 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, the tax commission may recompute the tax for the year or years for which the facility is not or was not in compliance with the applicable provisions of the environmental conservation law, the state sanitary code or codes, rules, regulations, permits or orders issued pursuant thereto, and for which a modification was allowed, and may assess any additional tax resulting from such recomputation within the time fixed by paragraph eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783.

   (4) In any taxable year when property is sold or otherwise disposed of, with respect to which a modification has been allowed pursuant to this paragraph, such modification shall be disregarded in computing gain or loss, and the gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of such property shall be the gain or loss entering into the computation of federal adjusted gross income for such taxable year.

(i) In the case of mines, oil and gas wells and other natural deposits, any allowance for percentage depletion pursuant to section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A of the internal revenue code shall be added to federal adjusted gross income. However, with respect to the property as to which such addition to federal adjusted gross income is required, an allowance for depletion shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income in the amount that would be deductible under section six hundred eleven of such code if the deduction for an allowance for depletion were computed without reference to such section six hundred thirteen or section six hundred thirteen A. With respect to the computation of depletion pursuant to this subdivision, the basis for such computation shall be the basis for state income tax purposes provided for in subsection (i) of section six hundred twelve of the tax law. The portion of any gain from the sale or other disposition of such property having a higher adjusted basis for city income tax purposes than for federal income tax purposes, that does not exceed such difference in basis, shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income.

(j) Modification for nonpublic school tuition.

   (1) General. An individual shall be entitled to subtract from his or her federal adjusted gross income an amount shown in the table set forth in this paragraph for his or her city adjusted gross income for the taxable year, computed without the benefit of this modification, multiplied by the number of his or her dependents, not exceeding three, attending a nonpublic school on a full-time basis for at least four months during the regular school year for the education of such dependent in grades one through twelve, provided such individual is allowed an exemption under section 11-1716 for such dependent.

** Editor's note: this second version of division (o)1.(B)(v)(2) applies to taxable years beginning on or after 1/1/2018; see L.L. 2014/59.

      (C) "New business investment" means and includes the following investments issued before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight by a new business pursuant to a plan described in clause (i) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph for money or other property (other than stock or securities) on or before the expiration of the third taxable year of such new business (excluding any short period immediately preceding such taxable year because the new business was not in existence for an entire taxable year) or forty-two months from the adoption of such plan, whichever is sooner: (i) original issuance capital stock as part of a new issue, (ii) other original issuance securities of a new issue of a like nature as stocks which are designed as a means of investment and issued for the purpose of financing corporate enterprises and providing for a distribution of rights in such enterprises, (iii) debt obligations such as bonds and debentures for a term of at least one year, whether secured or unsecured, and (iv) certificates and other instruments representing proprietary interests, whether limited or otherwise, in and assumption of general liabilities, whether limited or otherwise, of a partnership enterprise.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - If new business investment held for:
      - The modification is equal to the following proportion of the gain includible in federal adjusted gross income:
    * - At least four years, but less than five years
      - twenty-five percent 
    * - At least five years, but less than six years
      - fifty percent 
    * - At least six years
      - one hundred percent 
~



 

   3. Where, within six months of the realization of a new business investment gain allowable as the basis of a modification under paragraph two of this subdivision, such modification is equal to less than one hundred percent of the portion of the gain includible in federal adjusted gross income and the taxpayer purchases a new business investment which is then held for a period of at least six months, the taxpayer may subtract from his or her federal adjusted gross income ten percent (but not an amount that will reduce the portion of such gain included in his or her New York income below zero) of the amount of such gain where the purchase price of the new business investment is equal to or greater than the proceeds of the sale giving rise to such gain. Where the purchase price of the new business investment is less than an amount equal to the proceeds of such sale, the modification allowable under this paragraph shall be equal to ten percent of an amount equal to the product of: (A) the amount of the gain and (B) a fraction the numerator of which is the purchase price of the new investment and the denominator of which is an amount equal to the proceeds of such sale. The modification allowable under this paragraph may be utilized, at the option of the taxpayer, with respect to the taxable year in which the new business investment gain is realized or the year containing the last day of the six-month retention period described in this paragraph.

   4. The tax commission may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subdivision.

(p) New business investment deferral. For taxable years beginning before January first, nineteen hundred eighty-eight, at the option of the taxpayer, there may be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income a reinvested amount of long-term capital gain realized in a taxable year from the sale of a capital asset, as such term is defined in section twelve hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code, which is not a new business investment. A reinvested amount of long-term capital gain shall mean an amount which bears the same ratio to the long-term capital gain realized from the sale of a capital asset which was includible in New York adjusted gross income as that portion of the sale proceeds which is reinvested, within one year from date of sale, in a New York new business bears to the total sale proceeds. For the purposes of this subdivision, a New York new business is a business enterprise which:

   (1) has been a taxpayer under article nine-A, twenty-two, thirty-two or thirty-three of the tax law for no more than three taxable years (including short taxable years),

   (2) over fifty percent of the number of shares of stock that entitle the holders thereof to vote for the election of directors or trustees is not owned, directly or indirectly, by a taxpayer subject to tax under section one hundred eighty-three, one hundred eighty-four, one hundred eighty-five or one hundred eighty-six of article nine of the tax law, or under article nine-A, thirty-two or thirty-three of the tax law,

   (3) is not substantially similar in operation or ownership, directly or indirectly, to a business entity (or entities) taxable, or previously taxable, under such sections, such articles, article twenty-three of the tax law or which would have been subject to tax under article twenty-three (as such article was in effect on January first, nineteen hundred eighty) or the income (or losses) of which is (or was) includible under article twenty-two of the tax law whereby the intent and purpose of this subdivision would be evaded,

   (4) locates and employs at least ninety percent of its assets in the state.

   (5) employs principally in the state eighty percent of its employees (as ascertained within the meaning and intent of subparagraph three of paragraph (a) of subdivision three of section two hundred ten of the tax law and, in addition, in the case of a partnership, excluding partners), and

   (6) derives less than forty percent of its gross income from dividends, interest, royalties (other than mineral, oil, or gas royalties or copyright royalties), annuities and

   (7) reports at least twenty-five hundred dollars in gross income in any taxable year. The reinvested amount must qualify as a capital asset as defined pursuant to section twelve hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code and must be retained by the taxpayer for at least twelve months. The modification allowable under this subdivision shall be utilized with respect to the taxable year in which the twelve month retention period ends.

(q) An amount deferred under subdivision (p) hereof shall be added to federal adjusted gross income when the reinvestment in the New York new business which qualified a taxpayer for such deferral is sold.

(r) In the case of a sale or other disposition of property acquired from a decedent and valued by the executor of the estate of such decedent for the purposes of the tax under article twenty-six of the tax law (i) pursuant to paragraph two of subsection (b) of section nine hundred fifty-four of the tax law, or (ii) pursuant to section nine hundred fifty-four-a of the tax law, where such estate was insufficient to require the filing of a federal estate tax return, the amount necessary to properly reflect the gain or loss from such sale or other disposition which would have been realized under this chapter, had, in the case of clause (i) of this subdivision, a federal estate tax return been filed similarly valuing such property pursuant to section two thousand thirty-two of the internal revenue code, or in the case of clause (ii) of this subdivision, pursuant to section two thousand thirty-two-A of such code.

(s) New York S termination year. 

   (1) General. In the case of a New York S termination year, the amount of any item of S corporation income, loss and deduction included in the shareholder's federal adjusted gross income and any reductions for taxes (as described in paragraphs two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code) shall be adjusted in accordance with the treatment provided in paragraph two or three of this subdivision.

   (2) Pro rata allocation. Unless paragraph three of this subdivision applies, an equal portion of each S corporation item shall be assigned to each day of the S corporation's taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The portion of each such item thereby assigned to the S short year shall be treated as an item of a New York S corporation, and the portion of each such item thereby assigned to the C short year shall be treated as an item of an S corporation which is a New York C corporation.

   (3) Normal tax accounting. The portion of each S corporation item assigned to the S short year and the C short year shall be determined using normal tax accounting rules if:

      (A) there is a sale or exchange of fifty percent or more of the stock in such corporation during the New York S termination year or

      (B) the corporation so elects, as provided in subparagraph (B) of paragraph two of subsection (s) of section six hundred twelve of the tax law.

(t) Related members expense add back.

   (1) Definitions. 

      (A) Related member. "Related member" means a related person as defined in subparagraph (c) of paragraph three of subsection (b) of section four hundred sixty-five of the internal revenue code, except that "fifty percent" shall be substituted for "ten percent".

      (B) Effective rate of tax. "Effective rate of tax" means, as to any city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by the city on or measured by a related member's net income multiplied by the apportionment percentage, if any, applicable to the related member under the laws of said jurisdiction. For purposes of this definition, the effective rate of tax as to any city is zero where the related member's net income tax liability in said city is reported on a combined or consolidated return including both the taxpayer and the related member where the reported transactions between the taxpayer and the related member are eliminated or offset. Also, for purposes of this definition, when computing the effective rate of tax for a city in which a related member's net income is eliminated or offset by a credit or similar adjustment that is dependent upon the related member either maintaining or managing intangible property or collecting interest income in that city, the maximum statutory rate of tax imposed by said city shall be decreased to reflect the statutory rate of tax that applies to the related member as effectively reduced by such credit or similar adjustment.

      (C) Royalty payments. Royalty payments are payments directly connected to the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange, or any other disposition of licenses, trademarks, copyrights, trade names, trade dress, service marks, mask works, trade secrets, patents and any other similar types of intangible assets as determined by the state commissioner of taxation and finance, and include amounts allowable as interest deductions under section one hundred sixty-three of the internal revenue code to the extent such amounts are directly or indirectly for, related to or in connection with the acquisition, use, maintenance or management, ownership, sale, exchange or disposition of such intangible assets.

      (D) Valid business purpose. A valid business purpose is one or more business purposes, other than the avoidance or reduction of taxation, which alone or in combination constitute the primary motivation for some business activity or transaction, which activity or transaction changes in a meaningful way, apart from tax effects, the economic position of the taxpayer. The economic position of the taxpayer includes an increase in the market share of the taxpayer, or the entry by the taxpayer into new business markets.

   (2) Royalty expense add backs. 

      (A) For the purpose of computing city adjusted gross income, a taxpayer must add back royalty payments directly or indirectly paid, accrued, or incurred in connection with one or more direct or indirect transactions with one or more related members during the taxable year to the extent deductible in calculating federal taxable income.

      (B) Exceptions. 

         (i) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply to the portion of the royalty payment that the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, meets all of the following requirements:

            (I) the related member was subject to tax in this city or another city within the United States or a foreign nation or some combination thereof on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer;

            (II) the related member during the same taxable year directly or indirectly paid, accrued or incurred such portion to a person that is not a related member; and (III) the transaction giving rise to the royalty payment between the taxpayer and the related member was undertaken for a valid business purpose.

         (ii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that:

            (I) the related member was subject to tax on or measured by its net income in this city or another city within the United States, or some combination thereof;

            (II) the tax base for said tax included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer; and

            (III) the aggregate effective rate of tax applied to the related member in those jurisdictions is no less than eighty percent of the statutory rate of tax that applied to the taxpayer under section 11-1701 of this chapter for the taxable year.

         (iii) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer establishes, by clear and convincing evidence of the type and in the form specified by the commissioner of finance, that:

            (I) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred to a related member organized under the laws of a country other than the United States;

            (II) the related member's income from the transaction was subject to a comprehensive income tax treaty between such country and the United States;

            (III) the related member was subject to tax in a foreign nation on a tax base that included the royalty payment paid, accrued or incurred by the taxpayer;

            (IV) the related member's income from the transaction was taxed in such country at an effective rate of tax at least equal to that imposed by this city; and

            (V) the royalty payment was paid, accrued or incurred pursuant to a transaction that was undertaken for a valid business purpose and using terms that reflect an arm's length relationship.

         (iv) The adjustment required in this subdivision shall not apply if the taxpayer and the commissioner of finance agree in writing to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations. The commissioner of finance may, in his or her discretion, agree to the application or use of alternative adjustments or computations when he or she concludes that in the absence of such agreement the income of the taxpayer would not be properly reflected.

(u) Alimony modifications.

   (1) In the case of applicable alimony or separate maintenance payments, the following modifications shall apply:

      (A) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income any applicable alimony or separate maintenance payments made by the taxpayer during the taxable year.

      (B) There shall be added to federal adjusted gross income any applicable alimony or separate maintenance payments received by the taxpayer during the taxable year.

   (2) (A) The term "alimony or separate maintenance payments" means payments as defined under section seventy-one of the internal revenue code in effect immediately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.

      (B) The term "applicable alimony or separate maintenance payments" means payments made under an alimony or separation instrument (as defined in section seventy-one of the internal revenue code in effect immediately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97) that was executed after December thirty-first, two thousand eighteen, and any divorce or separation instrument executed on or before such date and modified after such date if the modification expressly provides that the amendments made by this section apply to such modification.

(v) Qualified moving expense reimbursement and moving expenses.

   (1) In the case of applicable qualified moving expense reimbursement and moving expenses, the following modifications shall apply:

      (A) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income any applicable qualified moving expense reimbursement received by the taxpayer during the taxable year.

      (B) There shall be subtracted from federal adjusted gross income any applicable moving expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taxable year.

   (2) Applicable qualified moving expense reimbursement and moving expenses are those deductions as allowed by paragraph (g) of section one hundred thirty-two and section two hundred seventeen, respectfully, of the internal revenue code immediately prior to the enactment of Public Law 115-97.

(a) Partner's and shareholder's modifications. In determining city adjusted gross income and city taxable income of a city resident partner or a city resident shareholder of an S corporation (other than an S corporation which is a New York C corporation), any modification described in subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of section 11-1712, or subdivision (c) of section 11-1715 or paragraph two or three of subdivision (d) of such section, which relates to an item of partnership or S corporation income, gain, loss or deduction shall be made in accordance with the partner's distributive share or the shareholder's pro rata share, for federal income tax purposes, of the item to which the modification relates.

(2) There shall be subtracted the modifications described in paragraphs four and five of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712, with respect to gains from the sale or other disposition of property, to the extent such gains are excluded from federal distributable net income of the estate or trust.

(3) There shall be added or subtracted (as the case may be) the share of the estate or trust in the city fiduciary adjustment determined under section 11-1719.

(4) There shall be added or subtracted (as the case may be) the modifications described in paragraphs six, ten, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty-four and thirty-five of subdivision (b) and in paragraphs eleven, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six and twenty-eight of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712 of this subchapter.

(5) In the case of a trust, there shall be added the amount of any includible gain, reduced by any deductions properly allocable thereto, upon which tax is imposed for the taxable year pursuant to section six hundred forty-four of the internal revenue code.






*§ 11-1719 Share of a resident estate, trust or beneficiary in city fiduciary adjustment.* ::


(a) General. An adjustment shall be made in determining city taxable income of a city resident estate or trust under section 11-1718, or city adjusted gross income of a city resident beneficiary of any estate or trust under subdivision (d) of section 11-1712, in the amount of the share of each in the city fiduciary adjustment as determined in this section.

(b) Definition. The city fiduciary adjustment shall be the net amount of the modifications described in section 11-1712 (including subdivision (d) if the estate or trust is a beneficiary of another estate or trust), and in subdivision (c) and paragraphs two and three of subdivision (d) of section 11-1715, and in subdivision (e) of this section, which relate to items of income, gain, loss or deduction of an estate or trust. The net amount of such modifications shall not include:

   (1) Any modification described in paragraphs one and two of subdivision (b) and paragraphs one, two, four, five, six, and seven of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712 with respect to any amount which, pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument, is paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose during the taxable year, and

   (2) Any modification described in paragraph four or five of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712, with respect to gains from the sale or other disposition of property, to the extent such gains are excluded from federal distributable net income of the estate or trust.

(c) Shares of city fiduciary adjustment.

   (1) The respective shares of an estate or trust and its beneficiaries (including, solely for the purpose of this allocation, nonresident beneficiaries) in the city fiduciary adjustment shall be in proportion to their respective shares of federal distributable net income of the estate or trust.

   (2) If the estate or trust has no federal distributable net income for the taxable year, the share of each beneficiary in the city fiduciary adjustment shall be in proportion to his or her share of the estate or trust income for such year, under local law or the governing instrument, which is required to be distributed currently and any other amounts of such income distributed in such year. Any balance of the city fiduciary adjustment shall be allocated to the estate or trust.

(d) Alternate attribution of modifications. The tax commission may by regulation establish such other method or methods of determining to whom the items comprising the fiduciary adjustment shall be attributed, as may be appropriate and equitable. Such method may be used by the fiduciary in his or her discretion whenever the allocation of the fiduciary adjustment pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section would result in an inequity which is substantial both in amount and in relation to the amount of the fiduciary adjustment.

(e) Additional modifications.

   (1) For any taxable year beginning after December thirty-first, two thousand seventeen, and before January first, two thousand twenty-six, to the extent that the estate or trust claimed a deduction for taxes under section 164 of the internal revenue code that was limited to ten thousand dollars as provided in section 164(b)(6)(B) or was denied as a result of section 164(b)(6)(A), there shall be subtracted the taxes paid or accrued in that taxable year by an estate or trust that the estate or trust was not able to deduct for federal income tax purposes because of such limitation or denial, other than state and local sales taxes and income taxes described in paragraph one of subdivision (c) of section 11-1715 of this subchapter. In determining the makeup of the ten thousand dollars of deduction claimed by the estate or trust under section 164 of the internal revenue code, it shall be presumed that the ten thousand dollars of deduction first comprises the state and local sales taxes or income taxes the estate or trust accrued or paid during the taxable year.

   (2) For any taxable year beginning after December thirty-first, two thousand seventeen, and before January first, two thousand twenty-six, there shall be subtracted the miscellaneous itemized deductions as described in and limited by section 67 of the internal revenue code (but excluding the deductions described in subsection (e) of section 67), but determined without regard to subsection (g) of such section.

   (3) For any taxable year, there shall be added the amount of any deduction allowed pursuant to section 199A of the internal revenue code.

(b) Limitation. The credits under this section shall not reduce the tax otherwise due from the beneficiary under this chapter to an amount less than would have been due if the accumulation distribution or his or her part thereof were excluded from his or her city adjusted gross income.

*§ 11-1753 Signing of returns and other documents.* ::


(a) General. Any return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this chapter shall be signed in accordance with regulations or instructions prescribed by the tax commission.

*§ 11-1754 Change of resident status.* ::


(a) General. If an individual changes his or her status during his or her taxable year from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, such individual shall file one return as a resident for the portion of the year during which he or she is a city resident, and a return under chapter nineteen of this title, for the portion of the year during which he or she is a city nonresident, subject to such exceptions as the tax commission may prescribe by regulation.

(b) City taxable income as city resident. The city taxable income for the portion of the year during which he or she is a city resident shall be determined, except as provided in subdivision (c), as if his or her taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the period of his or her city resident status.

(c) Special accruals.

   (1) If an individual changes his or her status from city resident to city nonresident, he or she shall, regardless of his or her method of accounting, accrue to the period of residence any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status, if not otherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report on an installment basis) or allowable for city income tax purposes for the portion of the taxable year prior to the change of status or for a prior taxable year. The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined with the applicable modifications described in sections 11-1712 and 11-1715 as if such accrued items were includible or allowable for federal income tax purposes.

   (2) If an individual changes his or her status from city nonresident to city resident, he or she shall, regardless of his or her method of accounting, accrue to the period of nonresidence any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status, other than items derived from or connected with New York state sources, if not otherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report on an installment basis) or allowable for federal income tax purposes for the portion of the taxable year prior to the change of status or for a prior taxable year. The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined with the applicable modifications described in sections 11-1712 and 11-1715 as if such accrued items were includible or allowable for federal income tax purposes.

   (3) No item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is accrued under this subdivision shall be taken into account in determining city adjusted gross income or the city itemized deduction for any subsequent taxable period.

   (4) The accruals under this subdivision shall not be required if the individual files with the tax commission a bond or other security acceptable to the tax commission, conditioned upon the inclusion of amounts accruable under this subdivision in city adjusted gross income for one or more subsequent taxable years as if the individual had not changed his or her resident status.

   (5) The foregoing provisions of this section shall apply if an individual changes his status from a city resident to city nonresident or from a city nonresident to a city resident during a taxable year, or at the beginning of a taxable year, as a result of a change of domicile or as a result of becoming a city resident or city nonresident based on the definition contained in subparagraph (B) of paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section 11-1705 of this chapter.

   (6) Except as hereinafter provided, where an individual who is a member of a partnership or shareholder of an S corporation changes status from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the portion of the distributive or pro rata share of income, gain and loss (less deductions attributable thereto) from a partnership or S corporation shall be allocated to the resident and nonresident periods of the partner or shareholder on a proportionate basis throughout the taxable year of the partnership or S corporation. In such event, the portion of the distributive or pro rata share allocated to the period of residency shall be determined based on the number of days of residency within the reporting period of the partnership or S corporation over the total number of days in the reporting period of the partnership or S corporation. Provided, however, that the commissioner may require, or the individual may elect, to accrue to the period of residence, and the period of nonresidence, the portion of the distributive or pro rata share of partnership or S corporation income, gain and loss (less deductions attributable thereto) accruing during the individual's respective resident and nonresident periods in a manner that reflects the date of accrual of said income, gain and loss by the partnership or S corporation.

   (7) Except as hereinafter provided, where an individual who is a beneficiary of an estate or trust changes status from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the portion of any estate or trust income credited, distributable, payable or required to be distributed to such beneficiary shall be allocated to the resident and nonresident periods of the beneficiary on a proportionate basis throughout the taxable year of the estate or trust. In such event, the portion of such estate or trust income allocated to the period of residency shall be determined based on the number of days of residency within the reporting period of the estate or trust. Provided, however, that the commissioner may require, or the beneficiary may elect, to accrue to the period of residence, and the period of nonresidence, the portion of such estate or trust income accruing during the beneficiary's respective resident and nonresident periods in a manner that reflects the date of accrual of said estate or trust income by the estate or trust.

(d) City minimum tax. Where two returns are required under this section, the total of the taxes due thereon shall not be less than would be due if the city taxable incomes reportable on the two returns were included in one return.

(f) Standard deduction. Where a return is required under this section, the city standard deduction allowable on such return shall be the amount allowed pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1714, prorated according to the period covered by the return.

(g) Trusts. If the status of a trust changes during its taxable year from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the fiduciary shall file one return as a city resident trust for the portion of the year during which the trust is a city resident trust, and one return under chapter nineteen of this title for the portion of the year during which the trust is a city nonresident trust, subject to such exceptions as the tax commission may prescribe by regulations. The provisions of subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section shall apply for the purposes of this subdivision, except to the extent that any of such provisions may be inconsistent with the provisions of section 11-1718, and except that the term "individual" shall be read as "trust", the term "city adjusted gross income" shall be read as "city taxable income", reference to "gain" shall include any modification for includible gain under subdivision five of section 11-1718, and the phrase "personal exemptions allowable under section 11-1716" shall be read as "city exemptions allowable under section 11-1718."

(h) Lump sum distributions. If the status of a taxpayer changes from city resident to city nonresident, or from city nonresident to city resident, the taxpayer shall, regardless of his or her method of accounting, accrue the total taxable amount of a lump sum distribution accruing prior to the change of status, if the ordinary income portion thereof is not otherwise subject to tax under section 11-1703 for the portion of the taxable year prior to the change in status or for a prior taxable year. No ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution the total taxable amount of which is accrued under this subdivision shall be subject to tax under section 11-1703 for any subsequent taxable period. The accrual under this subdivision shall not be required if the taxpayer files with the tax commission a bond or other security acceptable to the tax commission, conditioned upon the payment of tax under section 11-1703, with respect to such amount accruable under this subdivision, for a subsequent taxable year as if the taxpayer had not changed its resident status.

(i) Deduction for two-earner married couples. Where a return is required under this section, the amount of deduction under paragraph twenty-nine of subdivision (c) of section 11-1712 shall be equal to ten percent of the lesser of:

         (iv) "Tax software" means any computer software program intended for tax return preparation purposes.






*§ 11-1759 Report of federal changes, corrections or disallowances.* ::


If the amount of a taxpayer's federal taxable income, total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution or includible gain of a trust reported on his federal income tax return for any taxable year, or the amount of any claim of right adjustment, is changed or corrected by the United States internal revenue service or other competent authority, or as the result of a renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the United States or the amount an employer is required to deduct and withhold from wages for federal income tax withholding purposes is changed or corrected by such service or authority or if a taxpayer's claim for credit or refund of federal income tax is disallowed in whole or in part, the taxpayer or employer shall report such change or correction or disallowance within ninety days after the final determination of such change, correction, renegotiation, or disallowance, or as otherwise required by the commissioner, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. The allowance of a tentative carryback adjustment based upon a net operating loss carryback pursuant to section sixty-four hundred eleven of the internal revenue code shall be treated as a final determination for purposes of this section. Any taxpayer filing an amended federal income tax return and any employer filing an amended federal return of income tax withheld shall also file within ninety days thereafter an amended return under this chapter, and shall give such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this section as he or she deems appropriate. For purposes of this section, (i) the term "taxpayer" shall include a partnership having a resident partner or having any income derived from New York sources, and a corporation with respect to which the taxable year of such change, correction, disallowance or amendment is a year with respect to which the election provided for in subsection (a) of section six hundred sixty of the tax law is in effect, and (ii) the term "federal income tax return" shall include the returns of income required under sections six thousand thirty-one and six thousand thirty-seven of the internal revenue code. In the case of such a corporation, such report shall also include any change or correction of the taxes described in paragraphs two and three of subsection (f) of section thirteen hundred sixty-six of the internal revenue code. Reports made under this section by a partnership or corporation shall indicate the portion of the change in each item of income, gain, loss or deduction (and, in the case of a corporation, of each change in, or disallowance of a claim for credit or refund of, a tax referred to in the preceding sentence) allocable to each partner or shareholder and shall set forth such identifying information with respect to such partner or shareholder as may be prescribed by the commissioner.






*§ 11-1761 Change of election.* ::


Any election expressly authorized by this chapter may be changed on such terms and conditions as the tax commission may prescribe by regulation.






*§ 11-1762 Computation of tax where taxpayer restores substantial amount held under claim of right.* ::


(a) General. If:

   (1) an item was included in city adjusted gross income for a prior taxable year (or years) because it appeared that the taxpayer had an unrestricted right to such item, and

   (2) for the current taxable year the provisions of paragraph five of subsection (a) of section thirteen hundred forty-one of the internal revenue code apply to such item, then the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year shall be an amount equal to

   (3) the tax for the taxable year computed without regard to this section, minus

   (4) the decrease in tax under this chapter for the prior taxable year (or years) which would result solely from the exclusion of such item (or portion thereof) from city adjusted gross income for such prior taxable year (or years).

(b) Special rules. If the decrease in tax ascertained under paragraph four of subdivision (a) of this section exceeds the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year, such excess shall be considered a payment of tax on the last day prescribed by law for the payment of tax for the taxable year, and shall be refunded or credited in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for such taxable year.







**Subchapter 4: Withholding of Tax**



*§ 11-1771 Requirement of withholding tax from wages.* ::


(a) General.

   (1) Every employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this city or state and making payment on and after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-seven of any wages taxable under this chapter, or under section two of chapter eight hundred eighty-two of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-five, as amended by chapter eight hundred eighty-six of the laws of nineteen hundred seventy-five, shall deduct and withhold from such wages for each payroll period a tax computed in such manner as to result, so far as practicable, in withholding from the employee's wages during each calendar year an amount substantially equivalent to the tax reasonably estimated to be due under this chapter or such section two resulting from the inclusion in the employee's city adjusted gross income of his or her wages received during such calendar year. The method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be prescribed by regulations of the tax commission, with due regard to the city withholding exemptions of the employee and the sum of any credits allowable against his or her tax. The section shall not apply to payments by the United States for service in the armed forces of the United States so long as the right to require deduction and withholding of tax from such payments is prohibited by the laws of the United States. Service in the armed forces of the United States shall have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to withholding of city income taxes.

   (2) The tax commission may provide, by regulations, for withholding:

      (A) from remuneration for services performed by an employee for his or her employer which does not constitute wages, and

      (B) from any other type of payment, with respect to which the tax commission finds that withholding would be appropriate under the provisions of this chapter, if the employer and the employee, or in the case of any other type of payment the person making and the person receiving the payment, agree to such withholding. Such agreement shall be made in such form and manner as the tax commission may by regulations provide. For purposes of this chapter, remuneration or other payments with respect to which such agreement is made shall be treated as if they were wages paid by an employer to an employee to the extent that such remuneration is paid or other payments are made during the period for which the agreement is in effect.

   (3) The tax commission shall provide by regulation for an exemption from withholding for: (i) employees under eighteen years of age, (ii) employees under twenty-five years of age who are full-time students and (iii) employees over sixty-five years of age, provided such employees had no income tax liability in the prior year and can reasonably anticipate none in the current year.

(b)*   Extension of withholding to certain periodic payments and gambling winnings.

* Editor's note: there are two divisions designated (b) in this section.

   (1) For purposes of this chapter, any payment subject to withholding, within the meaning of paragraph two of this subdivision, shall be treated as if it were wages paid by an employer to an employee.

   (2) Payments subject to withholding. For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a payment subject to withholding means:

      (A) Any supplemental unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual to the extent includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income.

      (B) Any member or employee contributions to a retirement system or pension fund picked up by the employer pursuant to subdivision f of section five hundred seventeen or subdivision d of section six hundred thirteen of the retirement and social security law or section 13-225.1, 13-327.1, 13-125.1, 13-125.2 or 13-521.1 of the administrative code of the city of New York or subdivision nineteen of section twenty-five hundred seventy-five of the education law.

      (C) Any payment of an annuity to an individual to the extent includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income, if at the time the payment is made a request that such annuity be subject to withholding under this chapter is in effect.

      (D) Any payment of winnings from a wager placed in a lottery conducted by the division of the lottery, if the proceeds from such wager exceed five thousand dollars and such proceeds are payable pursuant to a prize claim made by an individual who was a resident of the city at the time of the selection of the prize winning lottery ticket.

      (E) [Repealed.]

      (F) Any amount deducted or deferred from an employee's salary under a flexible benefits program established pursuant to section twenty-three of the general municipal law or section one thousand two hundred ten-a of the public authorities law.

      (G) Any amount by which an employee's salary is reduced pursuant to the provisions of subdivision b of section 12-126.1 and subdivision b of section 12-126.2 of the code.

   (3) Additional provisions applicable to this subdivision.

      (A) Request for annuity withholding. A request that an annuity be subject to withholding under this chapter shall be made by the payee in writing to the person making the annuity payments. Such a request may, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be terminated by furnishing to the person making the payments a written statement of termination. Such a request for withholding or statement of termination shall take effect in such manner as the commissioner of taxation and finance shall prescribe.

      (B) Withholding on lottery winnings upon change of residence. If a payee of lottery winnings subject to the provisions of subparagraph (D) of paragraph two of this subdivision changes status from resident to nonresident, withholding in accordance with such subparagraph shall constitute other security acceptable to the commissioner of taxation and finance within the meaning of paragraph four of subdivision (c) of section 11-1754, unless such payee elects, in such manner as the commissioner of taxation and finance shall prescribe, to apply the provisions of paragraph one of such subdivision (c) to the proceeds, in which case withholding under this subdivision shall no longer apply to such proceeds.

      (C) Proceeds. For purposes of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph two of this subdivision, proceeds from a wager shall be determined by reducing the amount received by the amount of the wager.

      (D) Taxes withheld at maximum rate. The tax withheld on any payment subject to withholding under subparagraph (D) or (E) of paragraph two of this subdivision shall be withheld at the highest rate of tax on city taxable income, without any allowance for deductions or exemptions, in effect under this chapter for the taxable year in which the payment is made.

      (E) Determination of residence. For purposes of applying the provisions of subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph two of this subdivision, any payor of proceeds shall determine the residence of the payee of such proceeds in accordance with regulations or instructions of the commissioner of taxation and finance or, in the absence of any such regulations or instructions, in accordance with the address of the payee required under the provisions of paragraph six of subsection (q) of section thirty-four hundred two of the internal revenue code.

(b)*   Extension of withholding to unemployment compensation benefits, annuity payments, and lottery winnings.

* Editor's note: there are two divisions designated (b) in this section.

   (1) For purposes of this chapter:

      (A) any supplemental unemployment compensation benefit paid to an individual to the extent includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income,

      (B) any payment of an annuity to an individual to the extent includible in such individual's city adjusted gross income, if at the time the payment is made a request that such annuity be subject to withholding under this chapter is in effect, and

      (C) any periodic payment (but only where such payment is part of a series of payments extending over a period greater than one year), of lottery winnings by the division of the lottery, if at the time the payment is made a request that such lottery winnings be subject to withholding under this chapter is in effect, shall be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period.

      (D) any member or employee contributions to a retirement system or pension fund picked up or paid by the employer for members of the Manhattan and Bronx surface transportation authority pension plan and treated as employer contributions in determining income tax treatment under section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code.

   (2) Request for withholding. A request that an annuity be subject to withholding under this chapter shall be made by the payee in writing to the person making the annuity payments, and a request that lottery winnings be subject to withholding under this chapter shall be made by the payee in writing to the division of the lottery, in the manner prescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance.

   A request that an annuity be subject to withholding may, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, be terminated by furnishing to the person making the payments a written statement of termination. A request that lottery winnings be subject to withholding under this chapter shall not be revocable while the payee is a nonresident, and shall constitute other security acceptable to the tax commission within the meaning of paragraph four of subdivision (c) of section 11-1754 of this chapter. Such a request for withholding or statement of termination shall take effect in such manner as the commissioner of taxation and finance shall provide by regulation.

(c) Withholding exemptions. For purposes of this section:

   (1) The number of city withholding exemptions which an employee receiving wages taxable under this chapter may claim shall not exceed the number of city exemptions allowed pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1716 and such additional city withholding exemptions as may be prescribed by regulations or instructions of the commissioner of taxation and finance, taking into account the applicable standard deduction and such other factors as he finds appropriate.

   (2) The amount of each city withholding exemption shall be the amount of the city exemption allowed pursuant to the provisions of section 11-1716.

   (3) Withholding exemption certificate. An employee shall be required to file with his employer a withholding exemption certificate in accordance with regulations or instructions prescribed by the commissioner of taxation and finance.






*§ 11-1772 Information statement for employee.* ::


Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter from the wages of an employee, or who would have been required so to deduct and withhold tax if the employee had claimed no more than one withholding exemption, shall furnish to each such employee in respect of the wages paid by such employer to such employee during the calendar year on or before February fifteenth of the succeeding year, or, if his or her employment is terminated before the close of such calendar year, within thirty days from the date on which the last payment of the wages is made, a written statement as prescribed by the tax commission showing the amount of wages paid by the employer to the employee, the amount deducted and withheld as tax, and such other information as the tax commission shall prescribe. The written statement required herein may be furnished to such employee in an electronic format.






*§ 11-1773 Credit for tax withheld.* ::


Wages upon which tax is required to be withheld shall be taxable under this chapter as if no withholding were required, but any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under this chapter in any calendar year shall be deemed to have been paid to the tax commission on behalf of the person from whom withheld, and such person shall be credited with having paid that amount of tax for the taxable year beginning in such calendar year. For a taxable year of less than twelve months, the credit shall be made under regulations of the tax commission.






*§ 11-1774 Employer's return and payment of withheld taxes.* ::


(a) General. Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter shall file a withholding return and pay over to the tax commission or to a depository designated by the tax commission, the taxes so required to be deducted and withheld, as hereafter prescribed.

   (1) If, after having made a payroll, an employer has been required to deduct and withhold, but has not paid over, a cumulative aggregate amount of seven hundred dollars or more of tax during a calendar quarter, such employer shall file a return and pay over the tax. If an employer was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount of less than fifteen thousand dollars in withholding tax during the calendar year which precedes the previous calendar year, the tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the date of making such a payroll. If an employer was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount more than or equal to fifteen thousand dollars in withholding tax during the calendar year which precedes the previous calendar year, the tax shall be paid over on or before the third business day following the date of making such a payroll. In the case of an "educational organization" as defined in paragraph two of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax law or a "health care provider" as defined in paragraph four of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax law, the tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the date of making such a payroll.

   (2) If, at the close of any calendar quarter, an employer has been required to deduct and withhold, but has not paid over, a cumulative aggregate amount of less than seven hundred dollars of tax during such calendar quarter, such employer shall pay over the tax with the quarterly combined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return required to be filed for such quarter by paragraph four of this subdivision, on or before the last date prescribed by such paragraph for filing such return.

   (3) If an employer makes more than one payroll per week, then such employer shall determine the applicability of the rules described in paragraphs one and two of this subdivision measured by the last payroll made within the week by such employer; provided, however, that in any week in which the end of a quarter occurs between the making of payrolls by an employer, any tax required to be deducted and withheld in a payroll or payrolls made during such week prior to or on the end of the quarter shall be paid over. If an employer was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount of less than fifteen thousand dollars in withholding tax during the calendar year preceding the previous calendar year, the tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the date of making the last payroll in such quarter. If an employer was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount more than or equal to fifteen thousand dollars in withholding tax during the calendar year preceding the previous calendar year, the tax shall be paid over on or before the third business day following the date of making the last payroll in such quarter. In the case of an "educational organization" as defined in paragraph two of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax law or a "health care provider" as defined in paragraph four of subsection (a) of section nine of the tax law, the tax shall be paid over on or before the fifth business day following the date of making such a payroll. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "week" shall mean the period Sunday through Saturday.

   (4) (A) All employers described in paragraph one of subdivision (a) of section 11-1771, including those whose wages paid are not sufficient to require the withholding of tax from the wages of any of their employees, all employers required to provide the wage reporting information for the employees described in subdivision one of section one hundred seventy-one-a of the tax law, and all employers liable for unemployment insurance contributions or for payments in lieu of such contributions pursuant to article eighteen of the labor law, shall file a quarterly combined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return with the department of taxation and finance detailing the preceding calendar quarter's withholding tax transactions, such quarter's wage reporting information, such quarter's unemployment insurance contributions, and such other related information as the commissioner of taxation and finance or the commissioner of labor, as applicable, may prescribe. In addition, the return covering the last calendar quarter of each year shall also include withholding reconciliation information for such calendar year. Such returns shall be filed no later than the last day of the month following the last day of each calendar quarter; provided, however, that an employer may provide the wage reporting information covering the last calendar quarter of each year, and the withholding reconciliation information for such year no later than February twenty-eighth of the succeeding year.

      (B) An employer shall, at the time prescribed by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for filing each quarterly combined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return, pay over, in a single remittance, the unemployment insurance contributions and aggregate withholding taxes required to be paid over with such return. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an overpayment of unemployment insurance contributions or of aggregate withholding taxes made by an employer with the quarterly combined withholding, wage reporting and unemployment insurance return for a calendar quarter may be only credited by such employer against such employer's liability for unemployment insurance contributions or aggregate withholding taxes, respectively.

   (5) The tax commission may, if it believes such action necessary for the protection of the revenues, require any employer to make such return and pay to it the tax deducted and withheld at any time, or from time to time.

   (6) "Aggregate amount" as used in paragraphs one, two and three of this subdivision means the aggregate of the aggregate amounts of New York state personal income tax, city personal income tax on residents and city earnings tax on nonresidents authorized pursuant to article two-E of the general city law required to be deducted and withheld.

(b) Deposit in trust for tax commission. Whenever any employer fails to collect, truthfully account for, pay over the tax, or make returns of the tax as required in this section, the tax commission may serve a notice requiring such employer to collect the taxes which become collectible after service of such notice, to deposit such taxes in a bank approved by the tax commission, in a separate account, in trust for and payable to the tax commission, and to keep the amount of such tax in such account until payment over to the tax commission. Such notice shall remain in effect until a notice of cancellation is served by the tax commission.






*§ 11-1775 Employer's liability for withheld taxes.* ::


Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter is hereby made liable for such tax. For purposes of assessment and collection, any amount required to be withheld and paid over to the tax commission, and any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto, shall be considered the tax of the employer. Any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the tax commission. No employee shall have any right of action against his or her employer in respect to any moneys deducted and withheld from his or her wages and paid over to the tax commission in compliance or in intended compliance with this chapter.






*§ 11-1776 Employer's failure to withhold.* ::


If an employer fails to deduct and withhold tax as required, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer, but the employer shall not be relieved from liability for any penalties, interest, or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.






*§ 11-1777 Designation of third parties to perform acts required of employers.* ::


In case a fiduciary, agent, or other person has the control, receipt, custody, or disposal of, or pays the wages of an employee or group of employees, employed by one or more employers, the tax commission, under regulations promulgated by it, is authorized to designate such fiduciary, agent, or other person to perform such acts as are required of employers under this chapter and as the tax commission may specify. Except as may be otherwise prescribed by the tax commission, all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of an employer shall be applicable to a fiduciary, agent, or other person so designated but, except as so provided, the employer for whom such fiduciary, agent, or other person acts shall remain subject to the provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers.






*§ 11-1778 Liability of third parties paying or providing for wages.* ::


(a) Direct payment by third party. If a lender, surety or other person, who is not an employer with respect to an employee or group of employees, pays wages directly to such an employee or group of employees, employed by one or more employers, or to an agent on behalf of such employee or employees, such lender, surety or other person shall be liable for the amount of taxes (together with interest) required to be deducted and withheld from such wages by the employer.

(b) Funds supplied to employer by third parties. If a lender, surety or other person supplies funds to or for the account of an employer for the specific purpose of paying wages of the employees of such employer, with actual notice or knowledge that such employer does not intend to or will not be able to make timely payment or deposit of the amounts of tax required by this chapter to be deducted and withheld by such employer from such wages, such lender, surety or other person shall be liable for the amount of the taxes (together with interest) which are not paid over to the tax commission by such employer with respect to such wages. However, the liability of such lender, surety or other person shall be limited to an amount equal to twenty-five percent of the amount so supplied to or for the account of such employer for such purpose.

(c) Effect of payment. Any amounts paid to the tax commission pursuant to this section shall be credited against the liability of the employer.

(a) General. If upon examination of a taxpayer's return under this chapter the tax commission determines that there is a deficiency of income tax, it may mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file an income tax return required under this chapter, the tax commission is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's city taxable income and tax thereon, from any information in its possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address in or out of this state. If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice of deficiency may be a single joint notice, except that if the tax commission has been notified by either spouse that separate residences have been established, then, in lieu of the single joint notice, a duplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse at his or her last known address in or out of this state. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of this state, unless the tax commission has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. After ninety days from the mailing of a notice of deficiency, such notice shall be an assessment of the amount of tax specified in such notice, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, except only for any such tax or other amounts as to which the taxpayer has within such ninety day period filed with the tax commission a petition under section 11-1789. If the notice of deficiency is addressed to a person outside of the United States, such period shall be one hundred fifty days instead of ninety days.

(c) Restrictions on assessment and levy. No assessment of a deficiency in tax and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun or prosecuted, except as otherwise provided in section 11-1794, until a notice of deficiency has been mailed to the taxpayer, nor until the expiration of the time for filing a petition contesting such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to the taxable year has been filed with the tax commission, until the decision of the tax commission has become final. For exception in the case of judicial review of the decision of the tax commission, see subdivision (c) of section 11-1790.

(d) Exceptions for mathematical errors. If a mathematical error appears on a return (including an overstatement of the credit for income tax withheld at the source, or of the amount paid as estimated income tax), the tax commission shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1787 (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax commission), or subdivision (b) of section 11-1789 (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax commission based on a notice of deficiency) nor shall such assessment or collection be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

(e) Exceptions where federal changes, corrections or disallowances are not reported. 

   (1) If the taxpayer or employer fails to comply with section 11-1759, instead of the mode and time of assessment provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, the tax commission may assess a deficiency based upon such federal change, correction or disallowance by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal change, correction or disallowance or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-1759, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.

   (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1787 (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the tax commission), or subdivision (b) of section 11-1789 (authorizing the filing of a petition with the tax commission based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall such assessment or the collection thereof be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

   (3) If a husband and wife are jointly liable for tax, a notice of additional tax due may be a single joint notice, except that if the tax commission has been notified by either spouse that separate residences have been established, then, in lieu of the joint notice, a duplicate original of the joint notice shall be mailed to each spouse at his or her last known address in or out of this state. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of this state, unless the tax commission has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time (whether or not a notice of deficiency has been issued) have the right to waive the restrictions on assessment and collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency by a signed notice in writing filed with the tax commission.

(g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of this chapter, a deficiency means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (i) the amount shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made or the tax computed by such taxpayer or by the tax commission), and less (ii) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency and plus (iii) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to payments on account of estimated tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a rebate means so much of an abatement, credit, refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.






*§ 11-1782 Assessment.* ::


(a) Assessment date. The amount of tax which a return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return would have shown to be due but for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing of the return (including any amended return showing an increase of tax). In the case of a return properly filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by the tax commission shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment is due. If a notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in subdivision (b) of section 11-1781 if no petition to the tax commission is filed, or if a petition is filed, then upon the date when a decision of the tax commission establishing the amount of the deficiency becomes final. If an amended return or report filed pursuant to section 11-1759 concedes the accuracy of a federal change or correction, any deficiency in tax under this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended return, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding section 11-1783. If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of section 11-1781, has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-1759, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date of receipt of payment, notwithstanding any other provisions.

(b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of any tax under this chapter (including interest, additions to tax and assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the tax commission may establish the same by regulations.

(c) Estimated income tax. No unpaid amount of estimated tax shall be assessed.

(d) Supplemental assessment. The tax commission may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental assessment, subject to the provisions of section 11-1781 where applicable, whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.

(e) Cross-reference. For assessment in case of jeopardy, see section 11-1794.






*§ 11-1783 Limitations on assessment.* ::


(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed).

(b) Time return deemed filed.

   (1) Early return. For purposes of this section a return of income tax, except withholding tax, filed before the last day prescribed by law or by regulations promulgated pursuant to law for the filing thereof, shall be deemed to be filed on such last day.

   (2) Return of withholding tax. For purposes of this section, if a return of withholding tax for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be deemed to be filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.

(c) Exceptions.

   (1)Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if:

      (A) no return is filed,

      (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or

      (C) the taxpayer or employer fails to comply with section 11-1759.

   (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of tax, both the tax commission and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

   (3) Report of federal changes, corrections or disallowances. If the taxpayer or employer complies with section 11-1759, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report or amended return) may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax attributable to such federal change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made.

   (4) Deficiency attributable to net operating loss carryback. If a deficiency is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback, it may be assessed at any time that a deficiency for the taxable year of the loss may be assessed.

   (5) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time within two years from the making of the refund, except that the assessment may be made within five years from the making of the refund if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.

   (6) Request for prompt assessment. If a return is required for a decedent or for a decedent's estate during the period of administration, the tax shall be assessed within eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more than three years after the return was filed, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section.

   (7) Report on use of certain property. Under the circumstances described in paragraph two of subdivision (g) of section 11-1712, the tax may be assessed within three years after the filing of a return reporting that property has been used for purposes other than research and development to a greater extent than originally reported.

   (8) Report concerning waste treatment facility, air pollution control facility or eligible business facility. Under the circumstances described in paragraph three of subdivision (h) of section 11-1712 or in paragraph five of subsection (c) of section seven hundred one of the tax law, the tax may be assessed within three years after filing of the return containing the information required by such paragraph, or, if a certificate of compliance in respect to an air pollution control facility shall be revoked, within three years after the tax commission shall receive notice of such revocation from the taxpayer or as required by section 19-0309 of the environmental conservation law, whichever notice is received earlier.

   (9) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph three of this subdivision, or as otherwise provided in this section where a longer period of time may apply, if a taxpayer files an amended return, an assessment of tax (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the amended return), including recovery of a previously paid refund, attributable to a change or correction on the amended return from a prior return may be made at any time within one year after such amended return is filed.

(d) Omission of income, total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution on return. The tax may be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed if:

   (1) an individual omits from his city adjusted gross income the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount of city adjusted gross income or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution stated in the return, or

   (2) an estate or trust omits from its city adjusted gross income, or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five percent of the amount stated in the return of city adjusted gross income, or the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution, respectively. For purposes of this paragraph, city adjusted gross income means New York adjusted gross income as determined under paragraph four of subsection (e) of section six hundred one of the tax law.

For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and amount of the item of income, the total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution.

(e) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the period of limitations on assessment or collection of tax or other amount (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the tax commission is prohibited under subdivision (c) of section 11-1781 from making the assessment or from collecting by levy.








*§ 11-1784 Interest on underpayment.* ::


(a) General. If any amount of income tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in this chapter for payment, interest on such amount at the underpayment rate set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to section 11-1797 of this subchapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. If the time for filing of a return of tax withheld by an employer is extended, the employer shall pay interest for the period for which the extension is granted and may not charge such interest to the employee.

(b) Exception as to estimated tax. This section shall not apply to any failure to pay estimated tax.

(c) Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer files a return within the time prescribed in this chapter (including any extension of time) and pays the amount of underpayment within three months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended.

(d) Suspension of interest on deficiencies. If a waiver of restrictions on assessment of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, and if notice and demand by the tax commission for payment of such deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of such waiver, interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the date of notice and demand.

(e) Tax reduced by carryback. If the amount of tax for any taxable year is reduced by reason of a carryback of a net operating loss, such reduction in tax shall not affect the computation of interest under this section for the period ending with the filing date for the taxable year in which the net operating loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file.

(f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as income tax. Any reference in this chapter to the tax imposed by this chapter shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax.

(g) Interest on penalties or additions to tax. Interest shall be imposed under subdivision (a) of this section in respect of any assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or addition to tax is not paid within twenty-one calendar days from the date of the notice and demand therefor under subdivision (b) of section 11-1792 of this title (ten business days if the amount for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars), and in such case interest shall be imposed only for the period from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.

(h) Payment within specified period after notice and demand. If notice and demand is made for payment of any amount under subdivision (b) of section 11-1792 of this title, and if such amount is paid within twenty-one calendar days (ten business days if the amount for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars) after the date of such notice and demand, interest under this sectiuon on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and demand.

(i) Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under this section may be assessed and collected, at any time during the period within which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates may be assessed and collected, respectively.

(j) Interest on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount which has been erroneously refunded, and which is recoverable by the commissioner of taxation and finance, shall bear interest at the underpayment rate set by such commissioner pursuant to section 11-1797 of this subchapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or a misrepresentation of a material fact.

(k) Satisfaction by credits. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this section on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period during which, if the credit had not been made, interest would have been allowable with respect to such overpayment.






*§ 11-1785 Additions to tax and civil penalties.* ::


(a) (1) Failure to file tax return.

      (A) In case of failure to file a tax return under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.

      (B) In the case of a failure to file a return of tax within sixty days of the date prescribed for filing of such return (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the addition to tax hereunder shall not be less than the lesser of one hundred dollars or one hundred percent of the amount required to be shown as tax on such return.

      (C) For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amounts shown as tax on any return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

   (3) Failure to pay tax required to be shown on return. In case of failure to pay any amount in respect of any tax required to be shown on a return required to be filed under this chapter which is not so shown (including an assessment made pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-1782 of this title) within twenty-one calendar days of the date of a notice and demand therefor (ten business days if the amount for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount of tax stated in such notice and demand one-half of one percent of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.

   (4) Limitations on additions.

      (A) With respect to any return, the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two of this subdivision. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph one shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(b) Deficiency due to negligence.

   (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or rules or regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under section 11-1784 with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which is attributable to the negligence or intentional disregard referred to in such paragraph, for the period beginning on the last date prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (3) If any payment is shown on a return made by a payor with respect to dividends, patronage dividends and interest under subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-two, subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-four or subsection (a) of section six thousand forty-nine of the internal revenue code, respectively, and the payee fails to include any portion of such payment in city adjusted gross income, any portion of an underpayment attributable to such failure shall be treated, for purposes of this subdivision, as due to negligence in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. If any penalty is imposed under this subdivision by reason of the preceding sentence, the amount of the penalty imposed by paragraph one of this subdivision shall be five percent of the portion of the underpayment which is attributable to the failure described in the preceding sentence.

(c) Failure by individual to pay estimated income tax. 

   (1) Addition to the tax. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section, in the case of any underpayment of estimated tax by an individual, there shall be added to the tax under this chapter for the taxable year an amount determined by applying the underpayment rate established under section 11-1797 of this subchapter, or if no rate is set, at the rate of seven and one-half percent per annum, to the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment. Such period shall run from the due date for the required installment to the earlier of the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year or, with respect to any portion of the underpayment, the date on which such portion is paid. For purposes of determining such date, a payment of estimated tax shall be credited against unpaid required installments in the order in which such installments are required to be paid. There shall be four required installments for each taxable year, due on April fifteenth, June fifteenth and September fifteenth of such taxable year and on January fifteenth of the following taxable year.

   (2) Amount of underpayment. For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, the amount of the underpayment shall be the excess of the required installment over the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the due date for the installment.

   (3) Required installment.

      (A) Except as provided in paragraph four of this subdivision, the amount of any required installment shall be twenty-five percent of the required annual payment.

      (B) The required annual payment is the lesser of

         (i) ninety percent of the tax shown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, ninety percent of the tax for such year), or

         (ii) one hundred percent of the tax shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year. Provided, however, that the tax shown on such return for taxable years beginning in two thousand eight shall be calculated as if paragraph three of subdivision (f) of section 11-1715 of this chapter was in effect for taxable years beginning in two thousand eight. Provided, however, that the tax shown on such return for taxable years beginning in two thousand nine shall be calculated as if paragraph two of subdivision (g) of section 11-1715 of this chapter was in effect for taxable years beginning in two thousand nine. Clause (ii) of this subparagraph shall not apply if the preceding taxable year was not a taxable year of twelve months or if the individual did not file a return for such preceding taxable year.

      (C) Limitation on use of preceding year's tax.

         (i) General. If the city adjusted gross income shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year exceeds one hundred fifty thousand dollars, clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be applied by substituting "one hundred ten percent" for "one hundred percent".

         (ii) Separate returns. In the case of a husband and wife who file separate returns pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 11-1751 for the taxable year for which the amount of the installment is being determined, clause (i) of this subparagraph shall be applied by substituting "seventy-five thousand dollars" for "one hundred fifty thousand dollars".

   (4) Annualized income installment.

      (A) In general. In the case of any required installment, if the individual establishes that the annualized income installment determined under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph is less than the amount determined under paragraph three of this subdivision, the annualized income installment shall be the required installment. Any reduction in a required installment resulting from the application of this subparagraph shall be recaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment determined under paragraph three of this subdivision by the amount of such reduction, and by increasing successive required installments as necessary to effect full recapture.

      (B) Determination of annualized income installment. In the case of any required installment, the annualized income installment is the excess, if any, of an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable income for months in the taxable year ending before the due date for the installment, over the aggregate amount of any prior required installments for the taxable year. The applicable percentage of the tax shall be twenty-two and one-half percent in the case of the first installment, forty-five percent in the case of the second installment, sixty-seven and one-half percent in the case of the third installment and ninety percent in the case of the fourth installment, and shall be computed without regard to any increase in the rates applicable to the taxable year unless such increase was enacted at least thirty days prior to the due date of the installment.

   (5) Definitions and special rules. 

      (A) Definition of the term tax and application of credits against tax. For purposes of this subdivision and subdivision (d) of this section, the term "tax" means the tax imposed under this chapter minus the credits against tax allowed under this chapter, other than the credit under section 11-1773, relating to tax withheld on wages. The credit allowed under section 11-1773 for the taxable year shall be deemed a payment of estimated tax, and an equal part of such amount shall be deemed paid on each installment due date for such taxable year, unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in which case the amounts so withheld shall be deemed payments of estimated tax on the dates on which such amounts were actually withheld.

      (B) Special rule where return filed on or before January thirty-first. If, on or before January thirty-first of the following taxable year, the taxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount computed on the return as payable, then no addition to tax shall be imposed under pargraph one of this subdivision with respect to any underpayment of the fourth required installment for the taxable year.

      (C) Special rules for farmers and fishermen. For purposes of this subdivision, if an individual is a farmer or fisherman for any taxable year there shall be only one required installment for the taxable year, due on January fifteenth of the following taxable year in an amount equal to the required annual payment determined under paragraph three of this subdivision by substituting sixty-six and two-thirds percent for ninety percent and without regard to subparagraph (C) of paragraph three of this subdivision. Subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be applied by substituting March first for January thirty-first and by treating the required installment under this subparagraph as the fourth required installment. An individual is a farmer or fisherman for any taxable year if the individual's federal gross income from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) for the taxable year is at least two-thirds of the total federal gross income from all sources for the taxable year or if such individual's federal gross income from farming or fishing (including oyster farming) shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year is at least two-thirds of the total federal gross income from all sources shown on such return.

      (D) Fiscal years. In applying this subdivision to a taxable year beginning on any date other than January first, there shall be substituted, for the months specified in this subdivision, the months which correspond thereto.

      (E) Short taxable year. This subdivision shall be applied to taxable years of less than twelve months in accordance with regulations prescribed by the tax commission.

      (F) Joint estimated tax of husband and wife. A husband and wife may make the required annual payment determined under paragraph three of this subdivision as if they were one taxpayer, in which case the liability under paragraph one of this subdivision with respect to the estimated tax shall be joint and several. No such joint payment may be made if husband and wife are separated under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, or if they have different taxable years. If a joint payment is made but husband and wife determine their taxes under this chapter separately, the estimated tax for such year may be treated as the estimated tax of either husband or wife, or may be divided between them, as they may elect.

   (6) Trusts and certain estates.

      (A) General. This subdivision shall apply to any trust or estate except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of this paragraph.

      (B) Exception for estates and certain trusts. This subdivision shall not apply with respect to any taxable year ending before the date two years after the date of the decedent's death to (i) the estate of such decedent or (ii) any trust all of which was treated (under subpart E of part 1 of subchapter J of chapter one of the internal revenue code) as owned by the decedent and to which the residue of the decedent's estate will pass under his will (or, if no will is admitted to probate, which is the trust primarily responsible for paying debts, taxes and expenses of administration).

      (C) Special rule for annualizations. In the case of any estate or trust, subparagraph (B) of paragraph four of this subdivision shall be applied by substituting "ending before the date one month before the due date for the installment" for "ending before the due date for the installment".

      (D) In the case of a trust, the trustee may elect to treat any portion of a payment of estimated tax made by such trust for any taxable year of the trust as a payment made by a beneficiary of such trust. Any amount so treated shall be treated as paid or credited to the beneficiary on the last day of such taxable year, and for purposes of this subdivision, the amount so treated shall not be treated as a payment of estimated tax made by the trust, but shall be treated as a payment of estimated tax made by such beneficiary on the January fifteenth following the end of the trust's taxable year.

      (E) An election under subparagraph (D) of this paragraph shall be made on or before the sixty-fifth day after the close of the taxable year and in such manner as the commissioner of taxation and finance may prescribe.

      (F) Extension to last year of estate. In the case of a taxable year reasonably expected to be the last taxable year of an estate, any reference in subparagraph (D) of this paragraph to a trust shall be treated as including a reference to an estate, and the fiduciary of the estate shall be treated as the trustee.

(d) Exceptions to addition to tax for failure to pay estimated income tax.

   (1) Where tax is small amount. No addition to tax shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section for any taxable year if the tax shown on the return for such taxable year (or, if no return is filed, the tax), reduced by the credit allowable under section 11-1773, is less than three hundred dollars.

   (2) Where no tax liability for preceding taxable year. No addition to tax shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section for any taxable year if the preceding taxable year was a taxable year of twelve months, the individual did not have any liability for tax under this chapter for the preceding taxable year and throughout the preceding taxable year the individual was a resident of this city or a nonresident who had city adjusted gross income.

   (3) Installment due on or after individual's death. No addition to tax shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section with respect to any installment due on or after the individual's death.

   (4) Waiver in certain cases.

      (A) In general. No addition to tax shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section with respect to any underpayment to the extent the tax commission determines that by reason of casualty, disaster or other unusual circumstances the imposition of such addition to tax would be against equity and good conscience.

      (B) Newly retired or disabled individuals. No addition to tax shall be imposed under subdivision (c) of this section with respect to any underpayment if the tax commission determines that in the taxable year for which estimated payments were required to be made or in the taxable year preceding such taxable year the taxpayer retired after having attained age sixty-two or became disabled, and that such underpayment was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.

(e) Deficiency due to fraud. 

   (1) If any part of a deficiency is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty percent of the deficiency.

   (2) There shall be added to the tax (in addition to the amount determined under paragraph one of this subdivision) an amount equal to fifty percent of the interest payable under section 11-1784 with respect to the portion of the underpayment described in such paragraph one which is attributable to fraud, for the period beginning on the last day prescribed by law for payment of such underpayment (determined without regard to any extension) and ending on the date of the assessment of the tax (or, if earlier, the date of the payment of the tax).

   (3) The addition to tax under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b) of this section.

   (4) In the case of a joint return under section 11-1751, this subdivision shall not apply with respect to the tax of a spouse unless some part of the underpayment is due to the fraud of such spouse.

(f) Non-willful failure to pay withholding tax. If any employer, without intent to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall fail to make a return and pay a tax withheld by him or her at the time required by or under the provisions of section 11-1774, such employer shall be liable for such tax and shall pay the same together with interest thereon and the addition to tax provided in subdivision (a) of this section, and such interest and addition to tax shall not be charged to or collected from the employee by the employer. The tax commission shall have the same rights and powers for the collection of such tax, interest and addition to tax against such employer as are now prescribed by this chapter for the collection of tax against an individual taxpayer.

(g) Willful failure to collect and pay over tax. Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax imposed by this chapter who willfully fails to collect such tax or truthfully account for and pay over such tax or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat the tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. No addition to tax under subdivision (b) or (e) of this section shall be imposed for any offense to which this subsection applies. The tax commission shall have the power, in its discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(h) Failure to file certain information returns. 

   (1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, in case of each failure to file a statement of a payment to another person, required under authority of subdivision (d) of section 11-1758 (relating to information at source, including the duplicate statement of tax withheld on wages) on the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, there shall, upon notice and demand by the tax commission and in the same manner as tax, be paid by the person so failing to file the statement, a penalty of fifty dollars for each statement not so filed, but the total amount imposed on the delinquent person for all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed ten thousand dollars.

   (2) If any partnership or S corporation required to file a return or report under subdivision (c) of section 11-1758 or under section 11-1759 for any taxable year fails to file such return or report at the time prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), or files a return or report which fails to show the information required under such subdivision (c) or section 11-1759, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall, upon notice and demand by the commissioner and in the same manner as tax, be paid by the partnership or S corporation a penalty for each month (or fraction thereof) during which such failure continues (but not to exceed five months). The amount of such penalty for any month is the product of fifty dollars, multiplied by the number of partners in the partnership or shareholders in the S corporation during any part of the taxable year who were subject to tax under this chapter during any part of such taxable year.

   (3) [Repealed.]

(i) Additional penalty. Any person who with fraudulent intent shall fail to pay, or to deduct or withhold and pay, any tax, or to make, render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable to penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter, to be imposed, assessed and collected by the tax commission. The tax commission shall have the power, in its discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(j) Fraudulent statement or failure to furnish statement to employee. In addition to any criminal penalties provided by law, any person required under the provisions of section 11-1772 to furnish a statement to an employee, who willfully furnishes a false or fraudulent statement, or who willfully fails to furnish a statement in the manner, at the time, and showing the information required under section 11-1772, or regulations prescribed thereunder, shall for each such failure be subject to a penalty under this chapter of fifty dollars.

(k) Failure to supply identifying numbers. If any person who is required by regulations prescribed under subdivision (b) of section 11-1758:

   (1) to include his or her identifying number in any return, statement, or other document;

   (2) to furnish his or her identifying number to another person; or

   (3) to include in any return, statement or other document made with respect to another person the identifying number of such other person, fails to comply with such requirement at the time prescribed by such regulations, such person shall, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, pay a penalty of five dollars for each such failure described in paragraph one of this subdivision and fifty dollars for each such failure described in paragraph two of this subdivision, and this paragraph, except that the total amount imposed on such person for all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed ten thousand dollars; except that for failure to include his or her own identification number in any return, statement or other document, such penalty shall not be imposed unless such person shall have failed to supply his or her identification number to the tax commission within thirty days after demand therefor.

(l) Additions treated as tax. The additions to tax and penalties provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as taxes, and any reference in this chapter to income tax or tax imposed by this chapter, shall be deemed also to refer to the additions to tax and penalties provided by this section. For purposes of section 11-1781, this subdivision shall not apply to:

   (1) any addition to tax under subdivision (a) except as to that portion attributable to a deficiency;

   (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c);

   (3) any penalty under subdivision (h) and any additional penalty under subdivision (i); and

   (4) any penalties under subdivisions (j), (k), (q), (r), (s) and (t).

(m) Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b) and (e) of this section, the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his or her return shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the deficiency only if such return was filed on or before the last day prescribed for the filing of such return, determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing.

(n) Person defined. For purposes of subdivisions (g), (i), (o), (q) and (r) of this section, the term person includes an individual, corporation, partnership or limited liability company or an officer or employee of any corporation (including a dissolved corporation), or a member or employee of any partnership, or a member, manager or employee of a limited liability company, who as such officer, employee, manager or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.

(o) Failure to make deposits of taxes. In case of failure by any person required by this chapter, or by regulations of the tax commission under this chapter, to deposit on the date prescribed therefor any amount of tax imposed by this chapter in a depository authorized pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 11-1792 to receive such deposits, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be imposed on such person a penalty of five percent of the amount of the underpayment. For purposes of this subdivision the term "underpayment" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be so deposited over the amount, if any, thereof, deposited on or before the date prescribed therefor.

(p) Substantial understatement of liability. If there is a substantial understatement of income tax for any taxable year, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to ten percent of the amount of any underpayment attributable to such understatement. For purposes of this subdivision, there is a substantial understatement of income tax for any taxable year if the amount of the understatement for the taxable year exceeds the greater of ten percent of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year, or two thousand dollars. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "understatement" means the excess of the amount of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year, over the amount of the tax imposed which is shown on the return reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of subdivision (g) of section 11-1781). The amount of such understatement shall be reduced by that portion of the understatement which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by the taxpayer if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item with respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are adequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the return. The tax commission may waive all or any part of the addition to tax provided by this subdivision on a showing by the taxpayer that there was reasonable cause for the understatement, or part thereof, and that the taxpayer acted in good faith.

(q) Frivolous tax returns. If any individual files what purports to be a return of any tax imposed by this chapter but which does not contain information on which the substantial correctness of the self-assessment may be judged, or contains information that on its face indicates that the self-assessment is substantially incorrect; and such conduct is due to a position which is frivolous, or an intent (which appears on the purported return) to delay or impede the administration of this chapter, then such individual shall pay a penalty not exceeding five hundred dollars. This penalty shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

(r) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents. 

   (1) Any person who, with the intent that tax be evaded, shall, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident to the performance of other services for which such person receives compensation, aid or assist in, or procure, counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation under, or in connection with any matter arising under this chapter of any return, report, declaration, statement or other document which is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, or supply any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present such return, report, declaration, statement or other document shall pay a penalty not exceeding one thousand dollars.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, the term "procures" includes ordering (or otherwise causing) a subordinate to do an act, and knowing of, and not attempting to prevent, participation by a subordinate in an act. The term "subordinate" means any other person (whether or not a director, officer, employee, or agent of the taxpayer involved) over whose activities the person has direction, supervision or control.

   (3) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a person furnishing typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance with respect to a document shall not be treated as having aided or assisted in the preparation of such document by reason of such assistance.

   (4) The penalty imposed by this subdivision shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

(s) False information with respect to withholding. In addition to any criminal penalty provided by law, if any individual makes a statement under section 11-1771 which results in a decrease in the amounts deducted and withheld under this chapter, and as of the time such statement was made, there was no reasonable basis for such statement, such individual shall pay a penalty of five hundred dollars for such statement. The tax commission shall waive the penalty imposed under this subdivision if the taxes imposed with respect to the individual under this chapter for the taxable year are equal to or less than the sum of the credits against such taxes allowed by this chapter, and the payments of estimated tax which are considered payments on account of such taxes.

(t) Failure of tax return preparer to conform to certain requirements.

   (1) Failure to sign return or claim for refund. Any individual who is a tax return preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund, who is required pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 to sign such return or claim for refund, and who fails to comply with such requirement with respect to such return or claim for refund, shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under this paragraph on any person with respect to returns or claims for refund filed during any calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.

   (2) Failure to furnish identifying number. If any identifying number required to be included on any return or claim for refund pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 is not so included, the person who is the tax return preparer with respect to such return or claim for refund shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars with respect to such return or claim for refund unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. For purposes of this paragraph, where an employer and one or more employees of such employer are tax return preparers with respect to the same return or claim for refund or where a partnership and one or more partners in such partnership are tax return preparers with respect to the same return or claim for refund, such employer or such partnership shall be deemed to be the sole tax return preparer with respect to such return or claim for refund. The maximum penalty imposed under this paragraph on any person with respect to returns or claims for refund filed during any calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.

   (3) Failure to furnish copy to taxpayer. Any person who is a tax return preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund, who is required under paragraph three of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 to furnish a copy of such return or claim for refund to the taxpayer, and who fails to comply with such provision with respect to such return or claim for refund shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under this paragraph on any person with respect to returns or claims for refund filed during any calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.

   (4) Failure to retain copy or list. Any person who is a tax return preparer with respect to any return or claim for refund, who is required under paragraph four of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758 to: (i) retain a copy of such return or claim for refund or retain on a list the name and taxpayer identifying number of the taxpayer for whom such return or claim for refund was prepared and (ii) make such copy or list available for inspection upon request by the commissioner of taxation and finance, and who fails to comply with the retention requirement or who complies with the retention requirement but fails to comply with such request by the commissioner, shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such failure, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. The maximum penalty imposed under this paragraph on any person with respect to any calendar year shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars.

   (5) Failure to electronically file. If a tax return preparer is required to file returns electronically pursuant to paragraph ten of subdivision (g) of section 11-1758, and such preparer fails to file one or more of such returns electronically, then such preparer shall be subject to a penalty of fifty dollars for each such failure to electronically file a return, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.*

*§ 11-1786 Overpayment.* ::


(a) General. The state commissioner of taxation and finance, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment of income tax and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any tax imposed by this chapter or by chapter nineteen of this title on the person who made the overpayment or any other tax imposed on such person pursuant to the authority of the tax law or any other law if such tax is administered by the state commissioner of taxation and finance, against any liability in respect of any tax imposed on such person by the tax law and, as provided in sections one hundred seventy-one-c, one hundred seventy-one-d, one hundred seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f and one hundred seventy-one-l of the tax law, against past-due support, against a past-due legally enforceable debt, against a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt and against the amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan. The balance shall be refunded by the state comptroller out of the proceeds of the tax retained by him or her for such general purpose. Any refund under this section shall be made only upon the filing of a return and upon a certificate of the state commissioner of taxation and finance approved by the state comptroller. The state comptroller, as a condition precedent to the approval of such a certificate, may examine into the facts as disclosed by the return of the person who made the overpayment and other information and data available in the files of the state commissioner of taxation and finance.

(b) Excessive withholding. If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds his or her tax to which the credit relates, the excess shall be considered an overpayment.

(c) Overpayment by employer. If there has been an overpayment of tax required to be deducted and withheld under section 11-1771, refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.

(d) Overpayment by a deceased person. Notwithstanding section thirteen hundred ten of the surrogate's court procedure act, any overpayment by a decedent not in excess of one thousand dollars may be refunded to the decedent's surviving spouse unless the return for the decedent was filed by his or her executor or administrator.

(e) Credits against estimated tax. The commissioner of taxation and finance may prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated income tax for any taxable year of the amount determined to be an overpayment of the income tax for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of income tax is so claimed as a credit against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year, such amount shall be considered as a payment of the income tax for the succeeding taxable year, and no claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for the taxable year for which the overpayment arises, except upon request to the commissioner of taxation and finance on or before the last day prescribed for the filing of the return for the succeeding taxable year, determined with regard to any extension of time granted. If good cause is shown for reversing the credit, the commissioner of taxation and finance may, in his or her discretion, credit the overpayment against a liability or refund the overpayment without interest. Provided, the person who made the overpayment will not be relieved of liability for any penalty imposed for a consequent underpayment of estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year. The decision of the commissioner of taxation and finance to grant or deny the request is final and not subject to further administrative or judicial review.

(f) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax liability for a period in respect of which an amount is paid as income tax, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(g) Assessment and collection after limitation period. If any amount of income tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(h) Cross-reference. For provision barring application of article fifty-two of the civil practice law and rules to any amount to be refunded or credited to a taxpayer, see section seven of the tax law.






*§ 11-1787 Limitations on credit or refund.* ::


(a) General. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of income tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be allowable if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.

(b) Extension of time by agreement. If an agreement under the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (c) of section 11-1783 (extending the period for assessment of income tax) is made within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a claim for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund, or for making credit or refund if no claim is filed, shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a) of this section if a claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed.

(c) Notice of federal change or correction. A claim for credit or refund of any overpayment of tax attributable to a federal change or correction required to be reported pursuant to section 11-1759 shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such change or correction or such amended return was required to be filed with the commissioner of taxation and finance. If the report or amended return required by section 11-1759 is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, no interest shall be payable on any claim for credit or refund of the overpayment attributable to the federal change or correction. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer's amended federal income tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision.

(d) Overpayment attributable to net operating loss carryback. A claim for credit or refund of so much of an overpayment as is attributable to the application to the taxpayer of a net operating loss carryback shall be filed within three years from the time the return was due (including extensions thereof) for the taxable year of the loss, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (b) of this section in respect of such taxable year, or within the period prescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, where applicable, in respect of the taxable year to which the net operating loss is carried back, whichever expires the latest.

(e) Failure to file claim within prescribed period. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section or subdivision (d) of section 11-1790, after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this chapter, unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect of taxes under this chapter.

(f) Effect of petition to tax commission. If a notice of deficiency for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 11-1781 and if the taxpayer files a timely petition with the tax commission under section 11-1789, it may determine that the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not it also determines a deficiency for such a year). No separate claim for credit or refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be allowed or made, except:

   (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become final; and

   (2) as to any amount collected in excess of an amount computed in accordance with the decision of the tax commission which has become final; and

   (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy for collection has expired; and

   (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of a change or correction described in subdivision (c) of this section.

(g) Limit on amount of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment determined under subdivision (f) of this section shall, when the decision of the tax commission has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of section 11-1786 and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the tax commission determines as part of its decision was paid:

   (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or

   (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim had been filed (whether or not filed) stating the grounds upon which the tax commission finds that there is an overpayment.

(h) Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day, determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer.

(i) Prepaid income tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any income tax withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated income tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid by him or her on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment.

(j) Return and payment of withholding tax. Notwithstanding subdivision (h) of this section, for purposes of this section with respect to any withholding tax:

   (1) if a return for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be considered filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year; and

   (2) if a tax with respect to remuneration paid during any period ending with or within a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.

(k) Running of periods of limitation suspended while taxpayer is unable to manage financial affairs due to disability. 

   (1) In the case of an individual taxpayer, the running of the periods specified in subdivisions (a), (b), and (c) of this section shall be suspended during any period of such individual's life that such individual is financially disabled. For purposes of this subdivision, an individual taxpayer is an individual who is subject to the tax imposed under this chapter.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, an individual taxpayer is financially disabled if such individual is unable to manage his or her financial affairs by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment of that individual which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months. An individual shall not be considered to have such impairment unless proof of the existence thereof is furnished in such form and manner as the commissioner of taxation and finance may require.

   (3) An individual taxpayer shall not be treated as financially disabled during any period that such individual's spouse or any other person is authorized to act on behalf of such individual in financial matters.

(l) Cross-reference. For provision barring refund of overpayment credited against tax of a succeeding year, except for good cause shown, see subdivision (e) of section 11-1786.






*§ 11-1788 Interest on overpayment.* ::


(a) General. Notwithstanding the provisions of section sixteen of the state finance law, interest shall be allowed and paid as follows at the overpayment rate set by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to section 11-1797, or if no rate is set, at the rate of six percent per annum upon any overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:

   (1) from the date of the overpayment to the due date of an amount against which a credit is taken;

   (2) from the date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by the commissioner of taxation and finance) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than thirty days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon.

   (3) Late and amended returns and claims for credit or refund. Notwithstanding paragraph one or two of this subdivision, in the case of an overpayment claimed on a return of tax which is filed after the last date prescribed for filing such return (determined with regard to extensions), or claimed on an amended return of tax or claimed on a claim for credit or refund, no interest shall be allowed or paid for any day before the date on which such return or claim is filed.

   (4) Interest on certain refunds. To the extent provided for in regulations promulgated by the commissioner of taxation and finance, if an item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit is changed from the taxable year or period in which it is reported to the taxable year or period in which it belongs and the change results in an underpayment in a taxable year or period and an overpayment in some other taxable year or period, the provisions of paragraph three of this subdivision with respect to an overpayment shall not be applicable to the extent that the limitation in such paragraph on the right to interest would result in a taxpayer not being allowed interest for a length of time with respect to an overpayment while being required to pay interest on an equivalent amount of the related underpayment. However, this paragraph shall not be construed as limiting or mitigating the effect of any statute of limitations or any other provision of law relating to the authority of such commissioner to issue a notice of deficiency or to allow a credit or refund on an overpayment.

   (5) Amounts of less than one dollar. No interest shall be allowed or paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.

(b) Advance payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for income tax withholding. The provisions of subdivisions (h) and (i) of section 11-1787 applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitations on credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment for purposes of this section.

(c) Income tax refund within forty-five days of claim for overpayment. If any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter is credited or refunded within forty-five days after the last date prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for filing the return of such tax on which such overpayment was claimed or within forty-five days after such return was filed, whichever is later, or within forty-five days after an amended return was filed claiming such overpayment or within forty-five days after a claim for credit or refund was filed on which such overpayment was claimed, or within six months after a demand is filed pursuant to paragraph six of subsection (b) of section six hundred fifty-one of the tax law, no interest shall be allowed under this section on any such overpayment. For purposes of this subdivision, any amended return or claim for credit or refund filed before the last day prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for the filing of the return of tax for such year shall be considered as filed on such last day.

(d) Refund of income tax caused by carryback. For purposes of this section, if any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter results from a carryback of a net operating loss, such overpayment shall be deemed not to have been made prior to the filing date for the taxable year in which such net operating loss arises. Such filing date shall be determined without regard to extensions of time to file. For purposes of subdivision (c) of this section any overpayment described herein shall be treated as an overpayment for the loss year and such subdivision shall be applied with respect to such overpayment by treating the return for the loss year as not filed before claim for such overpayment is filed. The term "loss year" means the taxable year in which such loss arises.

(e) No interest until return in processible form.

   (1) For purposes of subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section, a return shall not be treated as filed until it is filed in processible form.

   (2) For purposes of paragraph one of this subdivision, a return is in a processible form if:

      (A) such return is filed on a permitted form, and

      (B) such return contains:

         (i) the taxpayer's name, address, and identifying number and the required signatures, and

         (ii) sufficient required information (whether on the return or on required attachments) to permit the mathematical verification of tax liability shown on the return.

(f) Overpayment credited against past-due support, or against a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or defaulted guaranteed student, state university or city university loans. If interest is payable pursuant to this section on that portion of an overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter which is certified by the state commissioner of taxation and finance to the state comptroller as the amount to be credited against past-due support, or against a past-due legally enforceable debt, or a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt, or the amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, state university or city university loan, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions of section one hundred seventy-one-c, section one hundred seventy-one-d, section one hundred seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f or one hundred seventy-one-l of the tax law, such portion of such an overpayment shall cease to bear interest on the date of such certification.

(g) Cross-reference. For provision with respect to interest after failure to file notice of federal change under section 11-1759, see subdivision (c) of section 11-1787.






*§ 11-1789 Petition to tax commission.* ::


(a) General. The form of a petition to the tax commission, and further proceedings before the tax commission in any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be governed by such rules as the tax commission shall prescribe. No petition shall be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by one or more members of the tax commission, or by a hearing officer designated by the tax commission to take evidence and report to the tax commission. The tax commissioners shall, acting as a body, jointly decide the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision shall be mailed promptly to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail at his or her last known address, and such notice shall set forth the tax commission's findings of fact and a brief statement of the grounds of decision in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to the taxpayer.

(b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety days, or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside of the United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency authorized by section 11-1781, the taxpayer may file a petition with the tax commission for a redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision (g) of section 11-1787.

(c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition with the tax commission for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:

   (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim for refund with the tax commission,

   (2) the taxpayer has not previously filed with the tax commission a timely petition under subdivision (b) of this section for the same taxable year unless the petition under this subdivision relates to a separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (f) of section 11-1787, and

   (3) either: (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or (B) the tax commission has mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than two years after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to the expiration of such two year period it has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the tax commission. If a taxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that he or she be mailed a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this subdivision for filing a petition for refund shall begin on the date such waiver is filed.

(d) Assertion of deficiency after filing petition.

   (1) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files with the tax commission, a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, the tax commission shall have power to determine a greater deficiency than asserted in the notice of deficiency and to determine if there should be assessed any addition to tax or penalty provided in section 11-1785, if claim therefor is asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission.

   (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with the tax commission a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the tax commission may:

      (A) determine a deficiency for such year as to any amount of deficiency asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission, and within the period in which an assessment would be timely under section 11-1783, or

      (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in the petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the same taxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the tax commission.

   (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the tax commission under this subdivision.

   (4) Restriction on further notices of deficiency. If the taxpayer files a petition with the tax commission under this section, no notice of deficiency under section 11-1781 may thereafter be issued by the tax commission for the same taxable year, except in case of fraud or with respect to a change or correction required to be reported under section 11-1759.

(e) Burden of proof. In any case before the tax commission under this chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the tax commission:

   (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax;

   (2) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer, but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax;

   (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency where such increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase in deficiency is the result of a change or correction required to be reported under section 11-1759, and of which change or correction the tax commission had no notice at the time it mailed the notice of deficiency; and

   (4) whether any person is liable for a penalty under subdivision (q) or (r) of section 11-1785.

(f) Evidence of related federal determination. Evidence of a federal determination relating to issues raised in a case before the tax commission under this section shall be admissible, under rules established by the tax commission.

(g) Jurisdiction over other years. The tax commission shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.






*§ 11-1790 Review of tax commission decision.* ::


(a) General. A decision of the tax commission shall be subject to judicial review at the instance of any taxpayer effected thereby in the manner provided by law for the review of a final decision or action of administrative agencies of the state. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.

(b) Judicial review exclusive remedy of taxpayer. The review of a decision of the tax commission provided by this section shall be the exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this chapter.

(c) Assessment pending review; review bond. Irrespective of any restrictions on the assessment and collection of deficiencies, the tax commission may assess a deficiency after the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section, notwithstanding that an application for judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his or her application for review is made, has paid the deficiency, has deposited with the tax commission the amount of the deficiency, or has filed with the tax commission a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under subdivision (h) of section 11-1794) in the amount of the portion of the deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in respect of which the application for review is made and all costs and charges which may accrue against him or her in the prosecution of the proceeding, including costs of all appeals, and with surety approved by a justice of the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned upon the payment of the deficiency (including interest and other amounts) as finally determined and such costs and charges. If as a result of a waiver of the restrictions on the assessment and collection of a deficiency any part of the amount determined by the tax commission is paid after the filing of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

(d) Credit, refund or abatement after review. If the amount of a deficiency determined by the tax commission is disallowed in whole or in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.

(e) Date of finality of tax commission decision. A decision of the tax commission shall become final upon the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section for making an application for review, if no such application has been duly made within such time, or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by the tax commission of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an application for review, the decision of the tax commission shall be deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.






*§ 11-1791 Mailing rules; holidays; miscellaneous.* ::


(a) (1) Timely mailing. If any return, claim, statement, notice, petition, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the tax commission, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the tax commission, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document or payment is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document or payment was delivered to the tax commission, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that the tax commission shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used in lieu of registered mail under this section. This subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States post office only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the tax commission.

   (2) (A) Any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the Internal Revenue Code and any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to a postmark by the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the Internal Revenue Code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the state, such commissioner may withdraw such designation for purposes of this article. Such commissioner may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the Internal Revenue Code for purposes of this article, or may withdraw any such designation if such commissioner finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the state. Any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by such commissioner and any reference in paragraph one of this subdivision to a postmark by the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the Internal Revenue Code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner.

      (B) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of taxation and finance pursuant to the same criteria used by the secretary for such designation pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the Internal Revenue Code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in paragraph one of this subdivision. If such commissioner finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or such commissioner is inadequate for the needs of the state, such commissioner may withdraw such designation for purposes of this article.

(b) Last known address. For purposes of this chapter, a taxpayer's last known address shall be the address given in the last return filed by such taxpayer, unless subsequent to the filing of such return the taxpayer shall have notified the tax commission of a change of address.

(c) Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.

(d) Certificate; unfiled return. For purposes of this chapter, the certificate of the tax commission to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required by or under the provisions of this chapter, shall be prima facie evidence that such tax has not been paid, that such return has not been filed, or that such information has not been supplied.

(e) Attorney general; jurisdiction. The attorney general shall have concurrent jurisdiction with any district attorney in the prosecution of any offenses arising under article thirty-seven of the tax law with respect to the tax imposed under this chapter.






*§ 11-1792 Collection, levy and liens.* ::


(a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the tax commission, and it may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due it under this chapter if not otherwise specified. The tax commission shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The tax commission may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositaries or financial agents of the state to receive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the tax commission may prescribe; and the tax commission shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the tax commission.

(b) Notice and demand for tax. The tax commission shall as soon as practicable give notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person's last known address. Except where the tax commission determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.

(c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within twenty-one calendar days after notice and demand therefor is given to such person under subdivision (b) of this section (ten business days if the amount for which such notice and demand is made equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars), the commissioner of taxation and finance may within six years after the date of such assessment issue a warrant under such commissioner's official seal directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell such person's real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to such commissioner and pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If such commissioner finds that the collection of the tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by such commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount such commissioner may issue a warrant without regard to the twenty-one day period (or ten-day period if applicable) provided in this subdivision.

(d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a lien upon the title to and interest in real, personal and other property of the taxpayer. Such lien shall not apply to personal property unless such warrant is filed in the department of state.

(e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the tax commission shall, in the right of the city, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.

(f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the warrant in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for his or her services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.

(g) Taxpayer not a resident. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) of this section shall have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a resident, and it appears to the tax commission that it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident, the tax commission may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance, a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section 11-1781. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in Albany county, and he or she shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the tax commission may authorize the institution of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure that a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The tax commission may also, in its discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not residents of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as the tax commission shall deem proper and sufficient.

(h) Action by state for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the attorney general at the instance of the tax commission in the name of the city or both to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced.

(i) Release of lien. The tax commission, if it finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as it may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.






*§ 11-1793 Transferees.* ::


(a) General. The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax, penalty or interest due under this chapter, shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax to which the liability relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive transfer, in order, from the original taxpayer to the transferee involved, but not by more than three years in the aggregate. The term transferee includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee.

(b) Exceptions.

   (1) If before the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the tax commission in any court against the original taxpayer or the last preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original taxpayer, then the period of limitation for assessment of liability of the transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after such claim has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.

   (2) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision (a) or the immediately preceding paragraph of this subdivision for the assessment of the liability, the tax commission and the transferee have both consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of tax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or refund, such agreement and any extension thereof shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof referred to in subdivision (b) of section 11-1787. If the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subdivision (b) of section 11-1787 on the amount of the credit or refund, the periods specified in subdivision (a) of section 11-1787 shall be increased by the period from the date of such expiration to the date of the agreement.

(c) Deceased transferor. If any person is deceased, the period of limitation for assessment against such person shall be the period that would be in effect if he or she had lived.

(d) Evidence. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (e) of section 11-1797 the tax commission shall use its powers to make available to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the transferee to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship to the original taxpayer or preceding transferee. See subdivision (e) of section 11-1789 for rule as to burden of proof.






*§ 11-1794 Jeopardy assessment.* ::


(a) Authority for making. If the tax commission believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, it shall, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11-1781 and 11-1796, immediately assess such deficiency (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the tax commission for the payment thereof.

(b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made before any notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under section 11-1781, then the tax commission shall mail a notice under such section within sixty days after the making of the assessment.

(c) Amount assessable before decision of tax commission. The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or not the taxpayer has theretofore filed a petition with the tax commission. The tax commission may, at any time before rendering its decision, abate such assessment, or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that it believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The tax commission may in its decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.

(d) Amount assessable after decision of tax commission. If the jeopardy assessment is made after the decision of the tax commission is rendered, such assessment may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the tax commission in its decision.

(e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy assessment may not be made after the decision of the tax commission has become final or after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of the tax commission.

(f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed with the tax commission and when the amount which should have been assessed has been determined by a decision of the tax commission which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the tax commission, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 11-1786 without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the tax commission.

(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The tax commission may abate the jeopardy assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the tax commission in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the tax commission, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of assessments and levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated had not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy assessment until the expiration of the tenth day after the day on which such jeopardy assessment is abated.

(h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount of any jeopardy assessment may be stayed by filing with the tax commission, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired, conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of the bond the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond, and if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under section 11-1781 is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

(i) Petition to tax commission. If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his or her petition under section 11-1789, the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the tax commission which has become final. If the tax commission determines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced when the decision of the tax commission is rendered.

(j) Stay of sale of seized property pending tax commission decision. Where a jeopardy assessment is made, the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold:

   (1) if subdivision (b) of this section is applicable, prior to the issuance of the notice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section 11-1789 for filing a petition with the tax commission, and

   (2) if a petition is filed with the tax commission (whether before or after the making of such jeopardy assessment), prior to the expiration of the period during which the assessment of the deficiency would be prohibited if subdivision (a) of this section were not applicable. Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if the tax commission determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.

(k) Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-1784, the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without regard to any notice and demand for payment issued under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.

(l) Early termination of taxable year. If the tax commission finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove his or her property therefrom, or to conceal himself or herself or his or her property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the city personal income tax for the current or the preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the tax commission shall declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of the tax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the finding of the tax commission made as herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.

(m) Reopening of taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of the taxable period of the taxpayer by the tax commission, as provided in subdivision (1), the tax commission may reopen such taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the tax commission to have received income, within the current taxable year, since the termination of such period. A taxable period so terminated by the tax commission may be reopened by the taxpayer if he or she files with the tax commission a true and accurate return of taxable income and credits allowed under this chapter for such taxable period, together with such other information as the tax commission may by regulations prescribe.

(n) Furnishing of bond where taxable year is closed by the tax commission. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings under the provisions of subdivision (1) of this section prior to the expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the tax commission, a bond to insure the timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes or any city personal income taxes for prior years.






*§ 11-1795 Criminal penalties; cross-reference.* ::


For criminal penalties, see article thirty-seven of the tax law.






*§ 11-1796 Income taxes of members of armed forces and victims of certain terrorist attacks.* ::


(a) Time to be disregarded. In the case of an individual serving in the armed forces of the United States, or serving in support of such armed forces, in an area designated by the president of the United States by executive order as a "combat zone" at any time during the period designated by the president by executive order as the period of combatant activities in such zone, or hospitalized inside or outside the state as a result of injury received while serving in such an area during such time, the period of service in such area, plus the period of continuous hospitalization inside or outside the state attributable to such injury, and the next one hundred eighty days thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this chapter, in respect of the city personal income tax liability (including any interest, penalty, or addition to the tax) of such individual:

   (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed within the time prescribed therefor:

      (A) filing any return of income tax (except withholding tax);

      (B) payment of any income tax (except withholding tax) or any installment thereof or of any other liability in respect thereof;

      (C) filing a petition with the tax commission for credit or refund or for redetermination of a deficiency, or application for review of a decision rendered by the tax commission;

*§ 11-1797 General powers of tax commission.* ::


(a) General. The tax commission shall administer and enforce the tax imposed by this chapter and it is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require such facts and information to be reported, as it may deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter.

(b) Examination of books and witnesses. 

   (1) The tax commission for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for the purpose of making an estimate of taxable income of any person, shall have power to examine or to cause to have examined, by any agent or representative designated by it for that purpose, any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return, and may require the attendance of the person rendering the return or any officer or employee of such person, or the attendance of any other person having knowledge in the premises, and may take testimony and require proof material for its information, with power to administer oaths to such person or persons.

   (2) The tax commission may take any action under paragraph one of this subdivision to inquire into the commission of any offense connected with the administration or enforcement of this chapter, provided, however, that notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-1774 no such action shall be taken after a referral by the department or the tax commission to the attorney general, a district attorney or any other prosecutorial agency is in effect.

(c) Abatement authority. The tax commission, of its own motion, may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment of city personal income tax, or any liability in respect thereof, if the tax commission determines under uniform rules prescribed by it that the administration and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due. It may also abate, of its own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in respect thereof, which is excessive in amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No claim for abatement under this subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.

(d) Special refund authority. Where no questions of fact or law are involved and it appears from the records of the tax commission that any moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under a mistake of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the tax commission at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the power, upon making a record of its reasons therefor in writing, to cause such moneys so paid and being erroneously and illegally held to be refunded and to issue therefor its certificate to the comptroller.

(e) Secrecy requirement and penalties for violation. 

   (1) Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the tax commission, any tax commissioner, any officer or employee of the department of taxation and finance, any person engaged or retained by such department on an independent contract basis, any depositary to which any return may be delivered as provided in subdivision (h) or (i) of this section, any officer or employee of such depositary, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any report or return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any report or return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any report or return required under this chapter.

   (2) The officers charged with the custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the tax commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, the tax law or in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter or such tax law to which the city, state or the tax commission is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. The tax commission may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered after the hearing required under section 11-1789.

   (3) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery by the state commissioner of taxation and finance to the county clerk of a county within the city of New York of a mailing list of individuals to whom income tax forms are mailed by the state commissioner of taxation and finance for the sole purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors as provided in article sixteen of the judiciary law. Provided, however, such delivery shall only be made pursuant to an order of the chief administrator of the courts, appointed pursuant to section two hundred ten of such law. No such order may be issued unless such chief administrator is satisfied that such mailing list is needed to compile a proper list of prospective jurors for the county for which such order is sought and that, in view of the responsibilities imposed by the various laws of the state on the department of taxation and finance, it is reasonable to require the state commissioner of taxation and finance to furnish such list. Such order shall provide that such list shall be used for the sole purpose of compiling a list of prospective jurors and that such county clerk shall take all necessary steps to insure that the list is kept confidential and that there is no unauthorized use or disclosure of such list. Furthermore, nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or his or her duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with his or her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the attorney general or other legal representatives of the state or city of the report or return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter has been recommended by the commissioner of taxation and finance, the corporation counsel or the attorney general or has been instituted, or the inspection of the reports or returns required under this chapter by the comptroller or duly designated officer or employee of the state department of audit and control, for purposes of the audit of a refund of any tax paid by a taxpayer under this chapter, or the furnishing to the state department of social services of the amount of an overpayment of tax and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against past-due support pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-c of the tax law and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such overpayment or the furnishing to the New York state higher education services corporation of the amount of an overpayment of tax and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against the amount of a default in repayment of a guaranteed student loan pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-d of the tax law and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such overpayment or the furnishing to the state university of New York or the city university of New York or the attorney general on behalf of such state or city university the amount of an overpayment of tax and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against the amount of a default in repayment of a state university loan or city university loan pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-e of the tax law and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such overpayment, or the disclosing to a state agency, pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-f of the tax law, of the amount of an overpayment and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to such agency and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such overpayment, or the disclosing to the commissioner of finance of the city of New York, pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-l of the tax law, of the amount of an overpayment and interest thereon certified to the comptroller to be credited against a city of New York tax warrant judgment debt and of the name and social security number of the taxpayer who made such overpayment.

The state comptroller shall require adequate security from all such depositories of such revenue collected by the state commissioner of taxation and finance. The state comptroller shall retain in his or her hands such amounts as the commissioner of taxation and finance may determine to be necessary for refunds in respect to the taxes imposed by this chapter and such chapter nineteen and for reasonable costs of the state commissioner of taxation and finance in administering, collecting and distributing such taxes, out of which the comptroller shall pay any refunds of such taxes to which taxpayers shall be entitled under this chapter and such chapter nineteen and except further that he shall pay to a non-obligated spouse that amount of overpayment of tax imposed pursuant to the authority of article thirty of the New York state tax law or former article two-E of the general city law and the interest on such amount which has been credited pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-c, one hundred seventy-one-d, one hundred seventy-one-e, one hundred seventy-one-f or one hundred seventy-one-l of the New York state tax law and which is certified to him by the commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount due such non-obligated spouse pursuant to paragraph six of subsection (b) of section six hundred fifty-one of the New York state tax law, and he shall deduct a like amount which he shall pay into the treasury to the credit of the general fund from amounts subsequently payable to the department of social services, the state university of New York, the city university of New York, the higher education services corporation, or to the revenue arrearage account or special offset fiduciary account pursuant to section ninety-one-a or ninety-one-c of the state finance law, as the case may be, whichever had been credited the amount originally withheld from such overpayment and, with respect to amounts originally withheld from such overpayment pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-l of the tax law and paid to the city of New York, the comptroller shall collect a like amount from the city of New York. The state comptroller, after reserving such refund fund and such costs shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, pay to the chief fiscal officer of the city the balance of such taxes collected, to be paid into the treasury of the city to the credit of the general fund except that he shall pay to the state department of social services that amount of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter nineteen of this title and the interest on such amount which is certified to him by the state commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited against past-due support pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-c of the New York state tax law and except that he shall pay to the New York state higher education services corporation that amount of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter nineteen of this title and the interest on such amount which is certified to him by the state commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited against the amount of defaults in repayment of guaranteed student loans pursuant to subdivision five of section one hundred seventy-one-d of the New York state tax law and except that he shall pay to the state university of New York or the city university of New York, respectively, that amount of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter nineteen of this title and the interest on such amount which is certified to him by the state commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited against the amount of defaults in repayment of state university or city university loans pursuant to subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-e of the New York state tax law, and except further that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, he shall credit to the revenue arrearage account, pursuant to section ninety-one-a of the state finance law, that amount of overpayments of the taxes imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter nineteen of this title and the interest on such amount which is certified to him by the state commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited against a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to a state agency pursuant to paragraph (a) of subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-f of the New York state tax law, provided, however, he shall credit to the special offset fiduciary account, pursuant to section ninety-one-c of the state finance law, any such amount creditable as a liability as set forth in paragraph (b) of subdivision six of section one hundred seventy-one-f of the tax law, and except further that he shall pay to the city of New York that amount of overpayments of tax imposed pursuant to this chapter or chapter nineteen of this title and the interest on such amount which is certified to him by the state commissioner of taxation and finance as the amount to be credited against city of New York tax warrant judgment debt pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one-l of the New York state tax law.

The amount of overpayment or underpayment shall be so certified to the state comptroller as soon after the discovery of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible and subsequent payments by the state comptroller to such chief fiscal officer shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from, or by adding the amount of any such underpayment to such number of subsequent payments and distributions as the state comptroller and the state commissioner of taxation and finance shall consider reasonable in view of the amount of the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts and circumstances.

*§ 11-1903 Taxable years to which tax imposed by this chapter applies; tax for taxable years beginning prior to and ending after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.* ::


(a) General. The tax imposed by this chapter is imposed for each taxable year beginning with taxable years ending on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six.

(b) Alternate methods for determining tax for taxable years ending on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six. 

   (1) The tax for any taxable year ending on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, shall be the same part of the tax which would have been imposed had this chapter been in effect for the entire taxable year as the number of months (or major portions thereof) of the taxable year occurring after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six is of the number of months (or major portions thereof) in the taxable year.

   (2) (i) In lieu of the method of computation of tax prescribed in paragraph one of this subdivision, if the taxpayer maintains adequate records for any taxable year ending on or after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, the tax for such taxable year, at the election of the taxpayer, may be computed on the basis of the wages which the taxpayer would have reported had he or she filed a federal income tax return for a taxable year beginning July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and ending with the close of such taxable year ending on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, and the net earnings from self-employment which the taxpayer would have reported for federal income tax purposes had he or she filed a self-employment tax return for a taxable year beginning July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six and ending with the close of such taxable year ending on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven.

      (ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the exclusions allowable under section 11-1902 of this subchapter shall be reduced by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months (or major portions thereof) of the taxable year occurring before July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, and the denominator of which is the number of months (or major portions thereof) in the taxable year. Except as provided in this paragraph, the tax for such period ending on or before June thirtieth, nineteen hundred sixty-seven, shall be computed in accordance with the other provisions of this chapter.






*§ 11-1904 Allocation to the city.* ::


(a) General. If net earnings from self-employment are derived from services performed, or from sources, within and without the city, there shall be allocated to the city a fair and equitable portion of such earnings.

(b) Allocation of net earnings from self-employment.

   (1) Place of business. If a taxpayer has no regular place of business outside the city all of his or her net earnings from self-employment shall be allocated to the city.

   (2) Allocation by taxpayer's books. The portion of net earnings from self-employment allocable to the city may be determined from the books and records of a taxpayer's trade or business, if the methods used in keeping such books and the accuracy thereof are approved by the commissioner as fairly and equitably reflecting net earnings from selfemployment within the city.

   (3) Allocation by formula. If paragraph two of this subdivision does not apply to the taxpayer, the portion of net earnings from self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined by multiplying (A) net earnings from self-employment within and without the city, by (B) the average of the following three percentages:

      (i) Property percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of real and tangible personal property connected with net earnings from self-employment and located within the city, by (B) the average of the value, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all real and tangible personal property connected with the net earnings from selfemployment and located both within and without the city. For this purpose, real property shall include real property whether owned or rented.

      (ii) Payroll percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the total wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the net earnings from self-employment derived from a trade or business carried on within the city, by (B) the total of all wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid or incurred during the taxable year to employees in connection with the net earnings from self-employment derived from a trade or business carried on both within and without the city.

      (iii) Gross income percentage. The percentage computed by dividing (A) the gross sales or charges for services performed by or through an agency located within the city, by (B) the total of all gross sales or charges for services performed within and without the city. The sales or charges to be allocated to the city shall include all sales negotiated or consummated, and charges for services performed, by an employee, agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly situated at, connected by contract or otherwise with, or sent out from, offices or other agencies of the trade or business from which a taxpayer is deriving net earnings from self-employment, situated within the city.

(c) Other allocation methods. The portion of net earnings from self-employment allocable to the city shall be determined in accordance with rules and regulations of the commissioner if it shall appear to the commissioner that the net earnings from self-employment are not fairly and equitably reflected under the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section.

(d) Special rules for real estate. Income and deductions from the rental of real property and gain and loss from the sale, exchange or other disposition of real property, shall not be subject to allocation under subdivision (b) or (c) of this section, but shall be considered as entirely derived from or connected with the place in which such property is located.






*§ 11-1905 Accounting periods and methods.* ::


(a) Accounting periods. A taxpayer's taxable year under this chapter shall be the same as his or her taxable year for federal income tax purposes.

(b) Change of accounting periods. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax purposes, his or her taxable year for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed. If a taxable period of less than twelve months results from a change of taxable year, the exclusion allowable under section 11-1902 of this subchapter shall be prorated under regulations of the commissioner.

(c) Accounting methods. A taxpayer's method of accounting under this chapter shall be the same as his or her method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. In the absence of any method of accounting for federal income tax purposes, net earnings from self-employment within the city shall be computed under such method as in the opinion of the commissioner clearly reflects net earnings from self-employment within the city.

(d) Change of accounting methods.

   (1) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed for federal income tax purposes, his or her method of accounting for purposes of this chapter shall be similarly changed.

   (2) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed, other than from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax which results from adjustments determined to be necessary solely by reason of the change shall not be greater than if such adjustments were ratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the preceding taxable years, beginning after July first, nineteen hundred sixty-six, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting from which the change is made.

   (3) If a taxpayer's method of accounting is changed from an accrual to an installment method, any additional tax for the year of such change of method and for any subsequent year which is attributable to the receipt of installment payments properly accrued in a prior year, shall be reduced by the portion of tax for any prior taxable year attributable to the accrual of such installment payments, in accordance with regulations of the commissioner.






*§ 11-1908 Withholding of tax on wages.* ::


On or after the first payroll period beginning August twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred sixty-six, every employer maintaining an office or transacting business within this state and making payment of any wages taxable under this chapter shall deduct and withhold from such wages for each payroll period a tax computed in such manner as to result, so far as practicable, in withholding from the employee's wages during each calendar year an amount substantially equivalent to the tax reasonably estimated to be due from the employee under this chapter. The method of determining the amount to be withheld shall be prescribed by regulations of the commissioner.






*§ 11-1909 Withholding of tax on wages for taxable periods commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-six.* ::


The provisions contained in sections 11-1908, 11-1910, 11-1911, 11-1912, 11-1913 and 11-1914 of this subchapter shall not be applicable to taxes imposed for taxable periods commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-six provided however, with respect to such periods, the provisions contained in part V of article twenty-two of the tax law shall be applicable with the same force and effect as if those provisions had been incorporated in full in this section except where inconsistent with the provisions of article two-E of the general city law, except that the term "aggregate amount" contained in paragraphs one, two and three of subsection (a) of section six hundred seventy-four of the tax law shall mean the aggregate amounts of New York state personal income tax, city earnings tax on nonresidents and city personal income tax on residents authorized pursuant to article thirty of the tax law required to be deducted and withheld and provided, however, that the provisions of such paragraphs shall not be applicable to employer's returns required to be filed with respect to taxes required to be deducted and withheld during the calendar year nineteen hundred seventy-six, but such returns shall be required to be filed with the tax commission at the times and in the manner provided for in subdivision (a) of section 11-1912 of this chapter, except the term "commission" in such subdivision shall be read as "tax commission." This section shall not apply to payments by the United States for service in the armed forces of the United States so long as the right to require deduction and withholding of tax from such payments is prohibited by the laws of the United States. Service in the armed forces of the United States shall have the same meaning as when used in a comparable context in the laws of the United States relating to withholding of city income taxes.






*§ 11-1910 Information statement for employee.* ::


Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter from the wages of an employee, shall furnish to each such employee in respect of the wages paid by such employer to such employee during the calendar year on or before February fifteenth of the succeeding year, or, if his or her employment is terminated before the close of such calendar year, within thirty days from the date on which the last payment of the wages is made, a written statement as prescribed by the commissioner showing the total amount of wages paid by the employer to the employee, the amount of wages paid for services performed within the city, the amount deducted and withheld as tax, and such other information as the commissioner may prescribe. The written statement required herein may be furnished to such employee in an electronic format.






*§ 11-1911 Credit for tax withheld.* ::


Wages upon which tax is required to be withheld shall be taxable under this chapter as if no withholding were required, but any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under this chapter in any calendar year shall be deemed to have been paid on behalf of the employee from whom withheld, and such employee shall be credited with having paid that amount of tax in such calendar year. For a taxable year of less than twelve months, the credit shall be made under regulations of the commissioner.






*§ 11-1912 Employer's return and payment of withheld taxes.* ::


(a) General. On or after the first payroll period beginning August twenty-seventh, nineteen hundred sixty-six, every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this chapter shall, for each calendar month, on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the close of such calendar month file a withholding return as prescribed by the commissioner and pay over to the commissioner or to the depository designated by the commissioner, the taxes so required to be deducted and withheld, except that for the month of December in any year the returns shall be filed and the taxes paid on or before January thirty-first of the succeeding year. Where the aggregate amount required to be deducted and withheld by any employer under this chapter and under chapter seventeen of this title is less than twenty-five dollars in a calendar month and the aggregate of such taxes for the semi-annual period ending on June thirtieth and December thirty-first can reasonably be expected to be less than one hundred fifty dollars, the commissioner may, by regulation, permit an employer to file a return on or before July thirty-first for the semi-annual period ending on June thirtieth and on or before January thirty-first for the semi-annual period ending on December thirty-first. The commissioner may, if he or she believes such action necessary for the protection of the revenues, require any employer to make a return and pay to him or her the tax deducted and withheld at any time, or from time to time. Where the amount of wages paid by an employer is not sufficient under this chapter and under chapter seventeen of this title to require the withholding of tax from the wages of any of his or her employees, the commissioner may, by regulation, permit such employer to file an annual return on or before February twenty-eighth of the following calendar year.

(b) Combined returns. The commissioner may by regulation provide for the filing of one return which shall include the return required to be filed under this section, together with the employer's return required to be filed under chapter seventeen of this title.

(c) Deposit in trust for city. Whenever any employer fails to collect, truthfully account for, pay over the tax, or make returns of the tax as required in this section, the commissioner may serve a notice requiring such employer to collect the taxes which become collectible after service of such notice, to deposit such taxes in a bank approved by the commissioner, in a separate account, in trust for the city and payable to the commissioner, and to keep the amount of such tax in such account until payment over to the commissioner. Such notice shall remain in effect until a notice of cancellation is served by the commissioner.






*§ 11-1913 Employer's liability for withheld taxes.* ::


Every employer required to deduct and withhold the tax under this chapter is hereby made liable for such tax. For purposes of assessment and collection, any amount required to be withheld and paid over to the commissioner, and any additions to tax, penalties and interest with respect thereto shall be considered the tax of the employer. Any amount of tax actually deducted and withheld under this chapter shall be held to be a special fund in trust for the city. No employee shall have any right of action against his or her employer in respect to any monies deducted and withheld from his or her wages and paid over to the commissioner in compliance or in intended compliance with this chapter.






*§ 11-1914 Employer's failure to withhold.* ::


If an employer fails to deduct and withhold the tax, as required, and thereafter the tax against which such tax may be credited is paid, the tax so required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the employer, but the employer shall not be relieved from liability for any penalties, interest or additions to the tax otherwise applicable in respect of such failure to deduct and withhold.






*§ 11-1915 Combined returns, employer's returns and payments.* ::


The state tax commission may require:

(1) The filing of any or all of the following:

   (B) A combined employer's return which in addition to the employer's return provided for by this chapter may also include employer's returns required to be filed under a law authorized by article thirty of the tax law and under article twenty-two of the tax law.

(2) Where a combined return or employer's return is required, and with respect to the payment of estimated tax, the state tax commission may also require payment of a single amount which shall be the total of the amounts (total taxes less any credits or refunds) required to be paid with the returns or employer's returns or in payment of estimated tax pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, a law authorized by article thirty of the tax law and pursuant to the provisions of article twenty-two of the tax law.







**Subchapter 2: Returns and Payment of Tax**



*§ 11-1916 Returns and payment of tax.* ::


(a) General. On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year, every person subject to the tax shall make and file a return and any balance of the tax shown due on the face of such return shall be paid therewith. The commissioner may, by regulation, provide for the filing of returns and payment of the tax at such other times as he or she deems necessary for the proper enforcement of this chapter. The commissioner may also provide by regulation that any return otherwise required to be made and filed under this chapter by any nonresident individual need not be made and filed if such nonresident individual had, during the taxable year to which the return would relate, no net earnings from self-employment within the city. Any regulation allowing such waiver of return may provide for additional limitations on and conditions and prerequisites to the privilege of not filing a return.

(b) Decedents. The return for any deceased individual shall be made and filed by his or her executor, administrator, or other person charged with his or her property. If a final return of a decedent is for a fractional part of a year, the due date of such return shall be the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the twelve-month period which began with the first day of such fractional part of the year.

(c) Individuals under a disability. The return for an individual who is unable to make a return by reason of minority or other disability shall be made and filed by his or her guardian, committee, fiduciary or other person charged with the care of his or her person or property (other than a receiver in possession of only a part of his or her property), or by his or her duly authorized agent.

(d) Estates and trust. The return for an estate trust shall be made and filed by the fiduciary.

(e) Joint fiduciaries. If two or more fiduciaries are acting jointly, the return may be made by any one of them.

(f) Cross-reference. For provisions as to information returns by partnerships, employers and other persons, see section 11-1921 of this subchapter.






*§ 11-1917 Time and place for filing returns and paying tax.* ::


A person required to make and file a return under this chapter shall, without assessment, notice or demand, pay any tax due thereon to the commissioner on or before the date fixed for filing such return (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing the return). The commissioner shall prescribe by regulation the place for filing any return, statement, or other document required pursuant to this chapter and for payment of any tax.






*§ 11-1918 Signing of returns and other documents.* ::


(a) General. Any return, statement or other document required to be made pursuant to this chapter shall be signed in accordance with regulations or instructions prescribed by the commissioner. The fact that an individual's name is signed to a return, statement, or other document, shall be prima facie evidence for all purposes that the return, statement or other document was actually signed by such individual.

(b) Partnerships. Any return, statement or other document required of a partnership shall be signed by one or more partners. The fact that a partner's name is signed to a return, statement, or other document, shall be prima facie evidence for all purposes that such partner is authorized to sign on behalf of the partnership.

(c) Certifications. The making or filing of any return, statement or other document or copy thereof required to be made or filed pursuant to this chapter, including a copy of a federal return, shall constitute a certification by the person making or filing such return, statement or other document or copy thereof that the statements contained therein are true and that any copy filed is a true copy.






*§ 11-1919 Change of residence status during year.* ::


(a) General. If an individual changes his or her status during his or her taxable year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident, he or she shall file a return as a nonresident for the portion of the year during which he or she is a nonresident if he or she is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter or, if not subject to such tax, an information return for the portion of the year during which he or she is a nonresident, subject to such exceptions as the commissioner may prescribe by regulation. Such information return shall be due at the same time as the return required by chapter seventeen of this title for the portion of the year during which such individual is a resident.

(b) City taxable wages and net earnings from self-employment for portion of year individual is a nonresident. The city taxable wages and net earnings from self-employment for the portion of the year during which he or she is a nonresident shall be determined, except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, under this chapter as if his or her taxable year for federal income tax purposes were limited to the period of his or her nonresident status.

(c) Special accruals.

   (1) If an individual changes his or her status from resident to nonresident, he or she shall, regardless of his or her method of accounting, accrue for the portion of the taxable year prior to such change of status any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status, if not otherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report on an installment basis) or allowable for city earnings tax purposes for such portion of the taxable year for a prior taxable year. The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined as if such accrued items were includible or allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes.

   (2) If an individual changes his or her status from nonresident to resident, he or she shall, regardless of his or her method of accounting, accrue for the portion of the taxable year prior to such change of status any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of status, if not otherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report on an installment basis) or allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes for such portion of the taxable year or for prior taxable year. The amounts of such accrued items shall be determined if such accrued items were includible or allowable for federal self-employment tax purposes.

   (3) No item of income, gain, loss or deduction which is accrued under this subdivision shall be taken into account in determining city adjusted wages earned, or net earnings from self-employment, within the city, for any subsequent taxable period.

   (4) Where an individual changes his or her status from resident to nonresident, the accruals under this subdivision shall not be required if the individual files with the commissioner a bond or other security acceptable to the commissioner, conditioned upon the inclusion of amounts accruable under this subdivision in city adjusted gross income under chapter seventeen of this title for one or more subsequent taxable years as if the individual has not changed his or her resident status. In such event, the tax under this chapter shall not apply to such amounts.

(d) Prorations. Where an individual changes his or her status during his or her taxable year from resident to nonresident or from nonresident to resident, the exclusion allowable under subdivision (b) of section 11-1902 of this chapter shall be prorated, under regulations of the commissioner, to reflect the portions of the entire taxable year during which the individual was a resident and a nonresident.






*§ 11-1920 Extension of time.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner may grant a reasonable extension of time for payment of tax or estimated tax (or any installment), or for filing any return, statement, or other document required pursuant to this chapter, on such terms and conditions as he or she may require. Except for a taxpayer who is outside the United States or who intends to claim nonresident status pursuant to subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of paragraph one of subdivision (h) of section 111901 of this chapter, no such extension for filing any return, statement or other document, shall exceed six months.

(b) Furnishing of security. If any extension of time is granted for payment of any amount of tax, the commissioner may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or other security in an amount not exceeding twice the amount for which the extension of time for payment is granted, on such terms and conditions as the commissioner may require.






*§ 11-1921 Requirements concerning returns, notices, records and statements.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner may prescribe regulations as to the keeping of records, the content and form of returns and statements, and the filing of copies of federal income tax returns and determinations. The commissioner may require any person, by regulation or notice served upon such person, to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such records, as the commissioner may deem sufficient to show whether or not such person is liable under this chapter for tax or for collection of tax.

(b) Partnerships. Every partnership doing business in the city and having no partners who are residents shall make a return for the taxable year setting forth all items of income, gain, loss and deduction and such other pertinent information as the commissioner may by regulations and instructions prescribe. Such return shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of each taxable year. For purposes of this subdivision, "taxable year" means year or period which would be a taxable year of the partnership if it were subject to tax under this chapter.

(c) Information at source. The commissioner may prescribe regulations and instructions requiring returns of information to be made and filed on or before February twenty-eighth of each year as to the payment or crediting in any calendar year of amounts of six hundred dollars or more to any taxpayer under this chapter. Such returns may be required of any person, including lessees or mortgagors of real or personal property, fiduciaries, employers, and all officers and employees of this state, or any municipal corporation or political subdivision of this state, having the control, receipt, custody, disposal or payment of interest, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments or other fixed or determinable gains, profits or income, except interest coupons payable to bearer. A duplicate of the statement as to tax withheld on wages, required to be furnished by an employer to an employee, shall constitute the return of information required to be made under this section with respect to such wages.

(d) Notice of qualification as receiver, etc. Every receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, assignee for benefit of creditors, or other like fiduciary shall give notice of his or her qualifications as such to the commissioner, as may be required by regulation.






*§ 11-1922 Report of change in federal or New York state taxable income.* ::


If the amount of a taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income reported on his or her federal or New York state tax return for any taxable year is changed or corrected by the United States internal revenue service or the New York state commissioner of taxation and finance or other competent authority, or as the result of a renegotiation of a contract or subcontract with the United States or New York state or if a taxpayer, pursuant to subsection (d) of section six thousand two hundred thirteen of the internal revenue code, executes a notice of waiver of the restrictions provided in subsection (a) of said section or if a taxpayer, pursuant to subdivision (f) of section six hundred eighty-one of the tax law executes a notice of waiver of the restrictions provided in subdivision (c) of said section, or if any tax on self-employment income in addition to that shown on his or her return is assessed, the taxpayer shall report such change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income or such execution of such notice of waiver or such assessment and the changes or corrections of his or her federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income on which it is based, within ninety days after the final determination of such change, correction, or renegotiation, or such execution of such notice of waiver or the making of such assessment as otherwise required by the commissioner, and shall concede the accuracy of such determination or state wherein it is erroneous. Any taxpayer filing an amended federal or New York state income or self-employment income tax return shall also file within ninety days thereafter an amended return under this chapter, and shall give such information as the commissioner may require. The commissioner may by regulation prescribe such exceptions to the requirements of this section as he or she deems appropriate. For purposes of this section, (i) the term "taxpayer" shall include a partnership having any income derived from city sources, and (ii) the term "federal income tax return" shall include the returns of income required under section six thousand thirty-one of the internal revenue code. Reports made under this section by a partnership shall indicate the portion of the change in each item of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to each partner and shall set forth such identifying information with respect to such partner as may be prescribed by the commissioner.







**Subchapter 3: Procedure and Administration**



*§ 11-1923 Notice of deficiency.* ::


(a) General. If upon examination of a taxpayer's return under this chapter the commissioner determines that there is a deficiency of tax, he or she may mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. If a taxpayer fails to file a return required under this chapter, the commissioner is authorized to estimate the taxpayer's wages and net earnings from self-employment or the wages from which taxes are required to be deducted and withheld and the tax thereon, from any information in the commissioner's possession, and to mail a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer. A notice of deficiency shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at such taxpayer's last known address in or out of the city. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of deficiency may be mailed to or her last know address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(b) Notice of deficiency as assessment. The notice of deficiency shall be an assessment of the amount of tax specified in such notice, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice.

(c) Restrictions on collection and levy. No notice and demand for payment of an assessment of a deficiency in tax made by a notice of deficiency and no levy or proceeding in court for its collection shall be made, begun or prosecuted, except as otherwise provided in section 11-1937 of this subchapter, until the expiration of the time for filing a petition contesting such notice, nor, if a petition with respect to the taxable year has been filed with the commissioner, until the decision of the commissioner has become final. After a petition has been filed the restriction provided herein shall not apply to such part of the deficiency as is not contested by the petition. For exception in the case of judicial review of the decision of the commissioner, see subdivision (c) of section 11-1932 of this subchapter.

(d) Exceptions for mathematical errors. If a mathematical error appears on a return (including an overstatement of the credit for tax withheld at the source or of the amount paid as estimated tax), the commissioner shall notify the taxpayer that an amount of tax in excess of that shown upon the return is due, and that such excess has been assessed. Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the commissioner), or subdivision (b) of section 11-1931 of this subchapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the commissioner based on a notice of deficiency) nor shall collection of such assessment be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section.

(e) Exception where change in federal or New York state taxable income is not reported.

    (1) If the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-1922 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing his or her federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income as reported on such taxpayer's federal or New York state tax return or in not reporting a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state tax purposes or in not filing an amended return or in not reporting the execution of a notice of waiver or an assessment described in such section, instead of the mode and time of assessment and collection provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner may assess a deficiency based upon such changed or corrected federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income by mailing to the taxpayer a notice of additional tax due specifying the amount of the deficiency, and such deficiency, together with the interest, additions to tax and penalties stated in such notice, shall be deemed assessed and subject to collection procedures on the date such notice is mailed unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-1922 of this chapter is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal or New York state determination of such notice of additional tax due are erroneous.

   (2) Such notice shall not be considered as a notice of deficiency for the purposes of this section, subdivision (f) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter (limiting credits or refunds after petition to the commissioner), or subdivision (b) of section 11-1931 of this subchapter (authorizing the filing of a petition with the commissioner based on a notice of deficiency), nor shall the collection of such assessment be prohibited by the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section. If the taxpayer is deceased or under a legal disability, a notice of additional tax due may be mailed to his or her last known address in or out of the city, unless the commissioner has received notice of the existence of a fiduciary relationship with respect to the taxpayer.

(f) Waiver of restrictions. The taxpayer shall at any time have the right to waive the mailing of a notice of deficiency or restriction on collection of the whole or any part of the deficiency, or both, by a signed notice in writing filed with the commissioner.

(g) Deficiency defined. For purposes of this chapter, a deficiency means the amount of the tax imposed by this chapter, less (1) the amount shown as the tax upon the taxpayer's return (whether the return was made or the tax computed by the taxpayer or by the commissioner), and less, (2) the amounts previously assessed (or collected without assessment) as a deficiency and plus (3) the amount of any rebates. For the purpose of this definition, the tax imposed by this chapter and the tax shown on the return shall both be determined without regard to payments on account of estimated tax or the credit for withholding tax; and a rebate means so much of an abatement, refund or other repayment (whether or not erroneous) made on the ground that the amounts entering into the definition of a deficiency showed a balance in favor of the taxpayer.

(h) Cross-reference. For provisions permitting a notice of deficiency under chapter seventeen of this title to be treated as a notice of deficiency under this chapter and permitting a notice of deficiency or a payment for which credit or refund is sought under chapter seventeen of this title to be treated as though made under this chapter where the taxpayer has filed a petition under such chapter seventeen for either a redetermination of deficiency or for credit or refund, see subdivision (h) of section 11-1736 of this title and subdivision (h) of section 11-1744 of this title.






*§ 11-1924 Assessment.* ::


(a) Assessment date. The amount of tax which a return shows to be due, or the amount of tax which a return would have shown to be due but for a mathematical error, shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing of the return (including any amended return showing an increase of tax). In the case of a return properly filed without computation of tax, the tax computed by the commissioner shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which payment is due. If a notice of deficiency has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date on which it is mailed. If an amended return or report filed pursuant to section 11-1922 of this chapter concedes the accuracy of a federal or New York state adjustment, change or correction, any deficiency in tax under this chapter resulting therefrom shall be deemed to be assessed on the date of filing such report or amended return, and such assessment shall be timely notwithstanding section 11-1925 of this subchapter. If a notice of additional tax due, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of section 11-1923 of this subchapter, has been mailed, the amount of the deficiency shall be deemed to be assessed on the date specified in such subdivision unless within thirty days after the mailing of such notice a report of the federal or New York state change or correction or an amended return, where such return was required by section 11-1922 of this chapter, is filed accompanied by a statement showing wherein such federal or New York state determination and such notice of additional tax due are erroneous. Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a tax, other than amounts withheld at the source or paid as estimated income tax, shall be deemed to be assessed upon the date of receipt of payment, notwithstanding any other provisions.

(b) Other assessment powers. If the mode or time for the assessment of any tax under this chapter (including interest, additions to tax and assessable penalties) is not otherwise provided for, the commissioner may establish the same by regulations.

(d) Supplemental assessment. The commissioner may, at any time within the period prescribed for assessment, make a supplemental assessment, subject to the provisions of section 11-1923 of this subchapter where applicable, whenever it is ascertained that any assessment is imperfect or incomplete in any material respect.

(e) Cross-reference. For assessment in case of jeopardy, see section 11-1937 of this subchapter.






*§ 11-1925 Limitations on assessment.* ::


(a) General. Except as otherwise provided in this section, any tax under this chapter shall be assessed within three years after the return was filed (whether or not such return was filed on or after the date prescribed).

(b) Exceptions.

   (1) Assessment at any time. The tax may be assessed at any time if:

      (A) no return is filed,

      (B) a false or fraudulent return is filed with intent to evade tax, or

      (C) the taxpayer fails to comply with section 11-1922 of this chapter in not reporting a change or correction increasing his or her federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income as reported on the taxpayer's federal or New York state tax return, or the execution of a notice of waiver and the changes or corrections on which it is based or in not reporting an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, or in not filing an amended return.

   (2) Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the assessment of tax, both the commissioner and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the tax may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon.

   (3) Report of changed or corrected federal or New York state income. If the taxpayer shall, pursuant to section 11-1922 of this chapter, report a change or correction or file an amended return increasing the taxpayer's federal or New York state taxable income or earnings from self-employment or report an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were a deficiency for federal or New York state income tax purposes, the assessment (if not deemed to have been made upon the filing of the report or amended return) may be made at any time within two years after such report or amended return was filed. The amount of such assessment of tax shall not exceed the amount of the increase in city tax on earnings attributable to such federal or New York state change or correction. The provisions of this paragraph shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which an assessment may otherwise be made.

   (4) Recovery of erroneous refund. An erroneous refund shall be considered an underpayment of tax on the date made, and an assessment of a deficiency arising out of an erroneous refund may be made at any time within two years from the making of the refund, except that the assessment may be made within five years from the making of the refund if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.

   (5) Request for prompt assessment. If a return is required for a decedent or for the decedent's estate during the period of administration, the tax shall be assessed within eighteen months after written request therefor (made after the return is filed) by the executor, administrator or other person representing the estate of such decedent, but not more than three years after the return was filed, except as otherwise provided in this subdivision and subdivision (c) of this section.

(c) Omission of income on return. The tax may be assessed at any time within six years after the return was filed if a taxpayer omits from a return an amount properly includible therein which is in excess of twenty-five per centum of the amount of the gross income derived by the taxpayer from any trade or business. For purposes of this subdivision there shall not be taken into account any amount which is omitted in the return if such amount is disclosed in the return, or in a statement attached to the return, in a manner adequate to apprise the commissioner of the nature and amount of such item.

(d) Suspension of running of period of limitation. The running of the period of limitations on or collection of tax or other amount (or of a transferee's liability) shall, after the mailing of a notice of deficiency, be suspended for the period during which the commissioner is prohibited under subdivision (c) of section 11-1923 of this subchapter collecting by levy or proceeding in court.






*§ 11-1926 Interest on underpayment.* ::


(a) General. If any amount of tax is not paid on or before the last date prescribed in this chapter for payment, interest on such amount at the appropriate rates prescribed for underpayments of tax under chapter seventeen of this title shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid, whether or not any extension of time for payment was granted. Interest under this subdivision shall not be paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar. If the time for filing a return of tax withheld by an employer is extended, the employer shall pay interest for the period for which the extension is granted and may not charge such interest to the employee. (c) Exception for mathematical error. No interest shall be imposed on any underpayment of tax due solely to mathematical error if the taxpayer files a return within the time prescribed in this chapter (including any extension of time) and pays the amount of underpayment within three months after the due date of such return, as it may be extended.

(d) No interest on interest. No interest under this chapter shall be imposed on any interest provided by this chapter.

(e) Suspension of interest on deficiencies. If a waiver of restrictions on collection of an assessment of a deficiency has been filed by the taxpayer, and if notice and demand by the commissioner for payment of such assessed deficiency is not made within thirty days after the filing of such waiver, interest shall not be imposed on such deficiency for the period beginning immediately after such thirtieth day and ending with the date of notice and demand.

(f) Interest treated as tax. Interest under this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as tax. Any reference in this chapter to the tax imposed by this chapter shall be deemed also to refer to interest imposed by this section on such tax.

(g) Interest on penalties or additions to tax. Interest shall be imposed under subdivision (a) of this section in respect of any assessable penalty or addition to tax only if such assessable penalty or addition to tax is not paid within ten days from the date of the notice and demand therefor under subdivision (b) of section 11-1934 of this subchapter, and in such case interest shall be imposed only for the period from such date of the notice and demand to the date of payment.

(h) Payment prior to notice of deficiency. If, prior to the mailing to the taxpayer of a notice of deficiency under subdivision (b) of section 11-1923 of this subchapter, the commissioner mails to the taxpayer a notice of proposed increase of tax and within thirty days after the date of the notice of proposed increase the taxpayer pays all amounts shown on the notice to be due to the commissioner, no interest under this section on the amount so paid shall be imposed for the period after the date of such notice of proposed increase.

(i) Payment within ninety days after notice of deficiency. If a notice of deficiency under section 11-1923 of this subchapter is mailed to the taxpayer, and the total amount specified in such notice is paid on or before the ninetieth day after the date of mailing, interest under this section shall not be imposed for the period after the date of the notice.

(j) Payment within ten days after notice and demand. If notice and demand is made for payment of any amount under subdivision (b) of section 11-1934 of this subchapter, and if such amount is paid within ten days after the date of such notice and demand, interest under this section on the amount so paid shall not be imposed for the period after the date of such notice and demand.

(k)Limitation on assessment and collection. Interest prescribed under this section may be assessed and collected at any time during the period within which the tax or other amount to which such interest relates may be assessed and collected, respectively.

(l) Interest on erroneous refund. Any portion of tax or other amount which has been erroneously refunded, and which is recoverable by the commissioner, shall bear interest at the rate of six per centum per annum from the date of the payment of the refund, but only if it appears that any part of the refund was induced by fraud or a misrepresentation of a material fact.

(m) Satisfaction by credits. If any portion of a tax is satisfied by credit of an overpayment, then no interest shall be imposed under this section on the portion of the tax so satisfied for any period during which, if the credit had not been made, interest would have been allowable with respect to such overpayment.






*§ 11-1927 Additions to tax and civil penalties.* ::


(a) Failure to file tax return. In case of failure to file a tax return under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount required to be shown as tax on such return five percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is for not more than one month, with an additional five percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate. For this purpose, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return.

(b) Deficiency due to negligence. If any part of a deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this chapter or rules or regulations hereunder (but without intent to defraud), there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to five percent of the deficiency.

(c) Failure to file declaration or underpayment of estimated tax. If any taxpayer fails to file a declaration of estimated tax or fails to pay all or any part of an installment of estimated tax, the taxpayer shall be deemed to have made an underpayment of estimated tax. There shall be added to the tax for the taxable year an amount at the rate of six per centum upon the amount of the underpayment for the period of the underpayment but not beyond the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. The amount of underpayment shall be the excess of the amount of the installment which would be required to be paid if the estimated tax were equal to seventy percent of the tax attributable to net earnings from self employment shown on the tax return for the taxable year (or if no return was filed, of the tax so attributable for such year) over the amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the last day prescribed for such payment. No underpayment shall be deemed to exist with respect to a declaration or installment otherwise due on or after the taxpayer's death.

(d) Exception to addition for underpayment of estimated tax. The addition to tax under subdivision (c) of this section with respect to any underpayment of any installment shall not be imposed if the total amount of all payments of estimated tax made on or before the last date prescribed for the payment of such installment equals or exceeds whichever of the following is the lesser:

   (1) The amount which would have been required to be paid on or before such date if the estimated tax were whichever of the following is the lesser:

      (A) The tax attributable to net earnings from self-employment shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year, if a return showing a liability for tax was filed by the individual for the preceding taxable year and such preceding year was a taxable year of twelve months, or

      (B) An amount equal to seventy percent of the tax so attributable for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized basis the taxable net earnings from self-employment for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid. For purposes of this subparagraph, the taxable net earnings from self-employment shall be placed on an annualized basis by:

         (i) multiplying by twelve (or, in the case of a taxable year of less than twelve months, the number of months in the taxable year) the taxable net earnings from self-employment for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid,

         (ii) dividing the resulting amount by the number of months in the taxable year ending before the month in which such installment date falls, and

         (iii) deducting from such amount the proper proportion of the exclusion allowable for the taxable year by subdivision (b) of section 11-1902 of this chapter; or

   (2) An amount equal to ninety percent of the tax computed, at the rates applicable to the taxable year, on the basis of the actual taxable net earnings from self-employment for the months in the taxable year ending before the month in which the installment is required to be paid.

(e) Deficiency due to fraud. If any part of a deficiency is due to fraud, there shall be added to the tax an amount equal to fifty percent of the deficiency. This amount shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (a) or (b) of this section.

(f) Non-willful failure to pay withholding tax. If any employer, without intent to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall fail to make a return and pay a tax withheld by him or her at the time required by or under provisions of section 11-1912 of this chapter, such employer shall be liable for such tax and shall pay the same together with interest thereon and the addition to tax provided in subdivision (a) of this section, and such interest and addition to tax shall not be charged to or collected from the employee by the employer. The commissioner shall have the same rights and powers for the collection of such tax, interest and addition to tax against such employer as are now prescribed by this chapter for the collection of tax against an individual taxpayer.

(g) Willful failure to collect and pay over tax. Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over the tax imposed by this chapter who willfully fails to collect such tax or truthfully account for and pay over such tax or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat the tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over. No addition to tax under subdivision (b) or (e) of this section shall be imposed for any offense to which this subdivision applies.

(h) Failure to file certain information returns. In case of each failure to file a statement of a payment to another person, required under authority of subdivision (c) of section 11-1921 of this chapter (relating to information at source, including the duplicate statement of tax withheld on wages) on the date prescribed therefor (determined with regard to any extension of time for filing), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, there shall, upon notice and demand by the commissioner and in the same manner as tax, be paid by the person so failing to file the statement, a penalty of one dollar for each statement not so filed, but the total amount imposed on the delinquent person for all such failures during any calendar year shall not exceed one thousand dollars.

(i) Additional penalty. Any person who with fraudulent intent shall fail to pay, or to deduct or withhold and pay, any tax, or to make, render, sign or certify any return or declaration of estimated tax, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable to a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter, to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner. The commissioner shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(j) Additions treated as tax. The additions to tax and penalties provided by this section shall be paid upon notice and demand and shall be assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as taxes, and any reference in this chapter to tax or tax imposed by this chapter, shall be deemed also to refer to the additions to tax and penalties provided by this section. For purposes of section 11-1923 of this subchapter, this subdivision shall not apply to:

   (1) any addition to tax under subdivision (a) except as to that portion attributable to a deficiency;

   (2) any addition to tax under subdivision (c); and

   (3) any additional penalty under subdivision (i).

(k) Determination of deficiency. For purposes of subdivisions (b) and (e), the amount shown as the tax by the taxpayer upon his or her return shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the deficiency only if such return was filed on or before the last day prescribed for the filing of such return, determined with regard to any extension of time for such filing.

(l) Person defined. For purposes of subdivisions (g) and (i), the term "person" includes an individual, corporation or partnership or an officer or employee of any corporation (including a dissolved corporation), or a member or employee of any partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under a duty to perform the act in respect of which the violation occurs.






*§ 11-1928 Overpayment.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner, within the applicable period of limitations, may credit an overpayment of tax and interest on such overpayment against any liability in respect of any tax imposed by this chapter or by another chapter or chapters of this title on the person who made the overpayment, and the balance shall be refunded. Any refund under this section shall be made only upon the filing of a return.

(b) Excessive withholding. If the amount allowable as a credit for tax withheld from the taxpayer exceeds his or her tax to which the credit relates, the excess shall be considered an overpayment.

(c) Overpayment by employer. If there has been an overpayment of tax required to be deducted and withheld under section 11-1908 of this chapter, refund shall be made to the employer only to the extent that the amount of the overpayment was not deducted and withheld by the employer.

(d) Credits against estimated tax. The commissioner may prescribe regulations providing for the crediting against the estimated tax for any taxable year of the amount determined to be an overpayment of the tax for a preceding taxable year. If any overpayment of tax is so claimed as a credit against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year, such amount shall be considered as a payment of the tax for the succeeding taxable year (whether or not claimed as a credit in the declaration of estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year), and no claim for credit or refund of such overpayment shall be allowed for the taxable year for which the overpayment arises.

(e) Rule where no tax liability. If there is no tax liability for a period in respect of which an amount is paid as tax, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(f) Assessment and collection after limitation period. If any amount of tax is assessed or collected after the expiration of the period of limitations properly applicable thereto, such amount shall be considered an overpayment.

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of law in article fifty-two of the civil practice law and rules to the contrary, the procedures for the enforcement of money judgments shall not apply to the department of finance, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance, as a garnishee, with respect to any amount of money to be refunded or credited to a taxpayer under this chapter.






*§ 11-1929 Limitations on credit or refund.* ::


(a) General. Claim for credit or refund of an overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within three years from the time the return was filed or two years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of such periods expires the later, or if no return was filed, within two years from the time the tax was paid. If the claim is filed within the three year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid within the three years immediately preceding the filing of the claim plus the period of any extension of time for filing the return. If the claim is not filed within the three year period, but is filed within the two year period, the amount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the claim. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no claim is filed, the amount of a credit or refund shall not exceed the amount which would be allowable if a claim had been filed on the date the credit or refund is allowed.

(b) Extension of time by agreement. If an agreement under the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (b) of section 11-1925 of this subchapter (extending the period for assessment of tax) is made within the period prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section for the filing of a claim for credit or refund, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund, or for making credit or refund if no claim is filed, shall not expire prior to six months after the expiration of the period within which an assessment may be made pursuant to the agreement or any extension thereof. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the tax paid after the execution of the agreement and before the filing of the claim or the making of the credit or refund, as the case may be, plus the portion of the tax paid within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a) if a claim had been filed on the date the agreement was executed.

(c) Notice of change or correction of federal or New York state income. If a taxpayer is required by section 11-1922 of this chapter to report a change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income reported on his or her federal or New York state tax return, or to report an assessment or a change or correction which is treated in the same manner as if it were an overpayment for federal or New York state income tax purposes, or to file an amended return with the commissioner, claim for credit or refund of any resulting overpayment of tax shall be filed by the taxpayer within two years from the time the notice of such change or correction or such amended return was required to be filed with the commissioner. If the report or amended return required by section 11-1922 of this chapter is not filed within the ninety day period therein specified, interest on any resulting refund or credit shall cease to accrue after such ninetieth day. The amount of such credit or refund shall not exceed the amount of the reduction in tax attributable to such federal or New York state change, correction or items amended on the taxpayer's amended federal or New York state income tax or self-employment tax return. This subdivision shall not affect the time within which or the amount for which a claim for credit or refund may be filed apart from this subdivision.

(d) Failure to file claim within prescribed period. No credit or refund shall be allowed or made, except as provided in subdivision (e) of this section or subdivision (d) of section 11-1932 of this subchapter after the expiration of the applicable period of limitation specified in this chapter unless a claim for credit or refund is filed by the taxpayer within such period. Any later credit shall be void and any later refund erroneous. No period of limitations specified in any other law shall apply to the recovery by a taxpayer of moneys paid in respect of taxes under this chapter.

(e) Effect of petition to commissioner. If a notice of deficiency for a taxable year has been mailed to the taxpayer under section 11-1923 of this subchapter and if the taxpayer files a timely petition with the commissioner under section 11-1931 of this subchapter, the commissioner may determine that the taxpayer has made an overpayment for such year (whether or not the commissioner also determines a deficiency for such year). No separate claim for credit or refund for such year shall be filed, and no credit or refund for such year shall be allowed or made, except:

   (1) as to overpayments determined by a decision of the commissioner which has become final;

   (2) as to any amount collected in excess of an amount computed in accordance with the decision of the commissioner which has become final;

   (3) as to any amount collected after the period of limitation upon the making of levy for collection has expired; and

   (4) as to any amount claimed as a result of a change or correction described in subdivision (c) of this section.

(f) Limit on amount of credit or refund. The amount of overpayment determined under subdivision (e) of this section shall, when the decision of the commissioner has become final, be credited or refunded in accordance with subdivision (a) of section 11-1928 of this subchapter and shall not exceed the amount of tax which the commissioner determines as part of his or her decision was paid:

   (1) after the mailing of the notice of deficiency, or

   (2) within the period which would be applicable under subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this section, if on the date of the mailing of the notice of deficiency a claim has been filed (whether or not filed) stating the grounds upon which the commissioner finds that there is an overpayment.

(g) Early return. For purposes of this section, any return filed before the last day prescribed for the filing thereof shall be considered as filed on such last day, determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer.

(h) Prepaid tax. For purposes of this section, any tax paid by the taxpayer before the last day prescribed for its payment, any tax withheld from the taxpayer during any calendar year, and any amount paid by the taxpayer as estimated tax for a taxable year shall be deemed to have been paid by the taxpayer on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of his or her taxable year with respect to which such amount constitutes a credit or payment.

(i) Return and payment of withholding tax. Notwithstanding subdivision (g) of this section, for purposes of this section with respect to any withholding tax:

   (1) if a return for any period ending with or within a calendar year is filed before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such return shall be considered filed on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year; and

   (2) if a tax with respect to remuneration paid during any period ending with or within a calendar year is paid before April fifteenth of the succeeding calendar year, such tax shall be considered paid on April fifteenth of such succeeding calendar year.

(j) Cross-reference. For provision barring refund of overpayment credited against tax of a succeeding year, see subdivision (d) of section 11-1928 of this subchapter.






*§ 11-1930 Interest on overpayment.* ::


(a) General. Notwithstanding the provisions of section three-a of the general municipal law, interest shall be allowed and paid as follows at the appropriate rates prescribed for overpayments of tax under chapter seventeen of this title upon any overpayment in respect of the tax imposed by this chapter:

   (1) from the date of the overpayment to the due date of an amount against which a credit is taken; or

   (2) from the date of the overpayment to a date (to be determined by the commissioner) preceding the date of a refund check by not more than thirty days, whether or not such refund check is accepted by the taxpayer after tender of such check to the taxpayer. The acceptance of such check shall be without prejudice to any right of the taxpayer to claim any additional overpayment and interest thereon. No interest shall be allowed or paid if the amount thereof is less than one dollar.

(b) Advance payment of tax, payment of estimated tax, and credit for tax withholding. The provisions of subdivisions (g), (h) and (i) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter applicable in determining the date of payment of tax for purposes of determining the period of limitations on credit or refund, shall be applicable in determining the date of payment for purposes of this section.

(c) Refund within three months of due date of tax. If any overpayment of tax imposed by this chapter is refunded within three months after the last date prescribed (or permitted by extension of time) for filing the return of such tax or within three months after the return was filed, whichever is later, no interest shall be allowed under this section on such overpayment.

(d) Cross-reference. For provision terminating interest after failure to file notice of federal or New York state change under section 11-1922 of this chapter, see subdivision (c) of 11-1929 of this subchapter.






*§ 11-1931 Petition to commissioner.* ::


(a) General. The form of a petition to the commissioner, and further proceedings before the commissioner in any case initiated by the filing of a petition, shall be governed by such rules as the commissioner shall prescribe. No petition shall be denied in whole or in part without opportunity for a hearing on reasonable prior notice. Such hearing shall be conducted by the commissioner, or by a hearing officer designated by the commissioner to take evidence and report to the commissioner. The commissioner shall decide the case as quickly as practicable. Notice of the decision shall be mailed promptly to the taxpayer by certified or registered mail at his or her last known address and such notice shall set forth the commissioner's findings of fact and a brief statement of the grounds of decision in each case decided in whole or in part adversely to the taxpayer. Any portion of an assessment of a deficiency disallowed by the commissioner's decision, shall be forthwith abated, or if paid, credited or refunded to the taxpayer without the making of a claim therefor.

(b) Petition for redetermination of a deficiency. Within ninety days, or one hundred fifty days if the notice is addressed to a person outside of the United States, after the mailing of the notice of deficiency authorized by section 11-1923 of this subchapter, the taxpayer may file a petition with the commissioner for a redetermination of the deficiency. Such petition may also assert a claim for refund for the same taxable year or years, subject to the limitations of subdivision (f) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter.

(c) Petition for refund. A taxpayer may file a petition with the commissioner for the amounts asserted in a claim for refund if:

   (1) the taxpayer has filed a timely claim for refund with the commissioner,

   (2) the taxpayer has not previously filed with the commissioner a timely petition under subdivision (b) of this section for the same taxable year unless the petition under this subdivision relates to a separate claim for credit or refund properly filed under subdivision (e) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter, and

   (3) either:

      (A) six months have expired since the claim was filed, or

      (B) the commissioner has mailed to the taxpayer, by registered or certified mail, a notice of disallowance of such claim in whole or in part. No petition under this subdivision shall be filed more than two years after the date of mailing of a notice of disallowance, unless prior to the expiration of such a two-year period it has been extended by written agreement between the taxpayer and the commissioner. If a taxpayer files a written waiver of the requirement that he or she be mailed a notice of disallowance, the two year period prescribed by this subdivision for filing a petition for refund shall begin on the date such waiver is filed.

(d) Assertion and assessment of deficiency after filing petition.

   (1) Petition for redetermination of deficiency. If a taxpayer files with the commissioner a petition for redetermination of a deficiency, the commissioner shall have power to determine and assess a greater deficiency than asserted in the notice of deficiency and to determine and assess any addition to tax or penalty provided in section 11-1927 of this subchapter, if claim therefor is asserted at or before the hearing and within the period in which an assessment would be timely under section 11-1925 of this subchapter under the rules of the commissioner.

   (2) Petition for refund. If the taxpayer files with the commissioner a petition for credit or refund for a taxable year, the commissioner may:

      (A) determine and assess a deficiency for such year as to any amount of deficiency claim (which shall be an assessment) for which is asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the commissioner, and within the period in which an assessment would be timely under section 11-1925 of this subchapter, or

      (B) deny so much of the amount for which credit or refund is sought in the petition, as is offset by other issues pertaining to the same taxable year which are asserted at or before the hearing under rules of the commissioner.

   (3) Opportunity to respond. A taxpayer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond to any matters asserted by the commissioner under this subdivision.

   (4) Restriction on further notices of deficiency. If the taxpayer files a petition with the commissioner under this section, no notice of deficiency under section 11-1923 of this subchapter may thereafter be issued by the commissioner for the same taxable year, except in case of fraud or with respect to a change or correction in federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income required to be reported under section 11-1922 of this chapter.

(e) Burden of proof. In any case before the commissioner under this chapter, the burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner except for the following issues, as to which the burden of proof shall be upon the commissioner:

   (1) whether the petitioner has been guilty of fraud with intent to evade tax;

   (2) whether the petitioner is liable as the transferee of property of a taxpayer (except where the petitioner's liability arises by reason of section 11-1936 of this subchapter), but not to show that the taxpayer was liable for the tax; and

   (3) whether the petitioner is liable for any increase in a deficiency where such increase is asserted initially after a notice of deficiency was mailed and a petition under this section filed, unless such increase in deficiency is the result of a change or correction of federal or New York state taxable income or self-employment income required to be reported under section 11-1922 of this chapter, and of which change or correction the commissioner had no notice at the time he or she mailed the notice of deficiency.

(f) Evidence of related federal determination. Evidence of a federal determination relating to issues raised in a case before the commissioner under this section shall be admissible, under rules established by the commissioner.

(g) Jurisdiction over other years. The commissioner shall consider such facts with relation to the taxes for other years as may be necessary correctly to determine the tax for the taxable year, but in so doing shall have no jurisdiction to determine whether or not the tax for any other year has been overpaid or underpaid.






*§ 11-1932 Review of commissioner's decision.* ::


(a) General. A decision of the commissioner shall be subject to judicial review for error, illegality or unconstitutionality at the instance of any taxpayer affected thereby in the manner provided by law for the review of a final decision or action of administrative agencies of the city. An application by a taxpayer for such review must be made within four months after notice of the decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.

(b) Judicial review exclusive remedy of taxpayer. The review of a decision of the commissioner provided by this section shall be exclusive remedy available to any taxpayer for the judicial determination of the liability of the taxpayer for the taxes imposed by this chapter.

(c) Collection pending review; review bond. Irrespective of any restrictions on the collection of assessments for deficiencies, the commissioner may collect by levy or, otherwise any assessment of a deficiency after the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section, nothwithstanding that an application for judicial review in respect of such deficiency has been duly made by the taxpayer, unless the taxpayer, at or before the time his or her application for review is made, has paid the assessed deficiency, has deposited with the commissioner the amount of the assessed deficiency, or has filed with the commissioner a bond (which may be a jeopardy bond under subdivision (h) of section 11-1937 of this subchapter) in the amount of the portion of the assessed deficiency (including interest and other amounts) in respect of which the application for review is made with surety approved by a justice of the supreme court of the state of New York, conditioned upon the payment of the assessed deficiency (including interest and other amounts) as finally determined. If as a result of a waiver of the restrictions on the collection of a deficiency any part of the amount determined by the commissioner is paid after the filing of the review bond, such bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. A similar bond for all costs and charges which may accrue against the taxpayer in the prosecution of such judicial review proceeding must be filed with the commissioner before any such proceeding is instituted.

(d) Credit, refund or abatement after review. If the amount of a deficiency assessed and determined by the commissioner is disallowed in whole or in part by the court of review, the amount so disallowed shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer, without the making of claim therefor, or, if payment has not been made, shall be abated.

(e) Date of finality of commissioner's decision. A decision of the commissioner shall become final upon the expiration of the period specified in subdivision (a) of this section for making an application for review, if no such application has been duly made within such time, or if such application has been duly made, upon expiration of the time for all further judicial review, or upon the rendering by the commissioner of a decision in accordance with the mandate of the court on review. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the purpose of making an application for review, the decision of the commissioner shall be deemed final on the date the notice of decision is sent by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer.






*§ 11-1933 Mailing rules; holidays.* ::


(a) Timely mailing. If any claim, statement, notice, petition, or other document (including to the extent authorized by the commissioner, a return or declaration of estimated tax) required to be filed within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by the United States mail to the commissioner, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, determined with regard to any extension granted for such filing, and only if such document was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed. To the extent that the commissioner shall prescribe by regulation, certified mail may be used in lieu of registered mail under this section. This subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States post office only if and to the extent provided by regulations of the commissioner.

(b) Last known address. For purposes of this chapter, a taxpayer's last known address shall be the address given in the last return filed by the taxpayer, unless subsequent to the filing of such return the taxpayer shall have notified the commissioner of a change of address.

(c) Last day a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday in the state of New York, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday.






*§ 11-1934 Collection, levy and liens.* ::


(a) Collection procedures. The taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collected by the commissioner, and he or she may establish the mode or time for the collection of any amount due the commissioner under this chapter if not otherwise specified. The commissioner shall, upon request, give a receipt for any sum collected under this chapter. The commissioner may authorize banks or trust companies which are depositories or financial agents of the city to receive and give a receipt for any tax imposed under this chapter in such manner, at such times, and under such conditions as the commissioner may prescribe; and the commissioner shall prescribe the manner, times and conditions under which the receipt of such tax by such banks and trust companies is to be treated as payment of such tax to the commissioner.

(b) Notice and demand for tax. The commissioner shall as soon as practicable and, in the case of an assessment the collection of which is restricted by the provisions of subdivision (c) of section 11-1923 of this subchapter, as soon as practicable after the expiration of such restrictions give notice to each person liable for any amount of tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest, which has been assessed but remains unpaid, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof. Such notice shall be left at the dwelling or usual place of business of such person or shall be sent by mail to such person's last known address. Except where the commissioner determines that collection would be jeopardized by delay, if any tax is assessed prior to the last date (including any date fixed by extension) prescribed for payment of such tax, payment of such tax shall not be demanded until after such date.

(c) Issuance of warrant after notice and demand. If any person liable under this chapter for the payment of any tax, addition to tax, penalty or interest neglects or refuses to pay the same within ten days after notice and demand therefor is given to such person under subdivision (b) of this section, the commissioner may within six years after the date of the expiration of the period of restriction on the collection of such assessment issue a warrant directed to the sheriff of any county of the state, or to any officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, commanding the sheriff or such officer or employee to levy upon and sell such person's real and personal property for the payment of the amount assessed, with the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner and pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of the warrant. If the commissioner finds that the collection of tax or other amount is in jeopardy, notice and demand for immediate payment of such tax may be made by the commissioner and upon failure or refusal to pay such tax or other amount the commissioner may issue a warrant without regard to the ten-day period provided in this subdivision.

(d) Copy of warrant to be filed and lien to be created. Any sheriff or officer or employee who receives a warrant under subdivision (c) of this section shall within five days thereafter file a copy with the clerk of the appropriate county. The clerk shall thereupon enter in the judgment docket, in the column for judgment debtors, the name of the taxpayer mentioned in the warrant, and in appropriate columns the tax or other amounts for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed; and such amount shall thereupon be a binding lien upon the real, personal and other property of the taxpayer.

(e) Judgment. When a warrant has been filed with the county clerk the commissioner shall, on behalf of the city, be deemed to have obtained judgment against the taxpayer for the tax or other amounts.

(f) Execution. The sheriff or officer or employee shall thereupon proceed upon the judgment in all respects, with like effect, and in the same manner prescribed by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and a sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees for such sheriff's services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. An officer or employee of the department of finance of the city may proceed in any county or counties of this state and shall have all the powers of execution conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of actual expenses paid in connection with the execution of the warrant.

(g) Taxpayer not then a resident. Where a notice and demand under subdivision (b) shall have been given to a taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, and it appears to the commissioner that it is not practicable to find in this state property of the taxpayer sufficient to pay the entire balance of tax or other amount owing by such taxpayer who is not then a resident of this state, the commissioner may, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section, issue a warrant directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance of the city a copy of which warrant shall be mailed by certified or registered mail to the taxpayer at his or her last known address, subject to the rules for mailing provided in subdivision (a) of section 11-1933 of this subchapter. Such warrant shall command the officer or employee to proceed in the city, and such officer or employee shall, within five days after receipt of the warrant, file the warrant and obtain a judgment in accordance with this section. Thereupon the commissioner may authorize the institution of any action or proceeding to collect or enforce the judgment in any place and by any procedure where and by which a civil judgment of the supreme court of the state of New York could be collected or enforced. The commissioner may also, in his or her discretion, designate agents or retain counsel for the purpose of collecting, outside the state of New York, any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter against taxpayers who are not then residents of this state, may fix the compensation of such agents and counsel to be paid out of money appropriated or otherwise lawfully available for payment thereof, and may require of them bonds or other security for the faithful performance of their duties, in such form and in such amount as the commissioner shall deem proper and sufficient.

(h) Action by the city for recovery of taxes. Action may be brought by the corporation counsel or other appropriate officer of the city at the insistance of the commissioner to recover the amount of any unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties or interest which have been assessed under this chapter within six years prior to the date the action is commenced. The period during which collection of any assessment is prohibited by subdivision (c) of section 11-1923 of this subchapter, shall be added to such six years.

(i) Release of lien. The commissioner, if he or she finds that the interest of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to this section, and such release may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed.






*§ 11-1935 Transferees.* ::


(a) General. The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer for any tax, additions to tax, penalty or interest due to the city under this chapter, shall be assessed, paid, and collected in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations as in the case of the tax to which liability relates, except that the period of limitations for assessment against the transferee shall be extended by one year for each successive transfer, in order, from the original taxpayer to the transferee involved, but not by more than three years in the aggregate. The term "transferee" includes donee, heir, legatee, devisee and distributee; and also includes a person liable for the amount of any tax, additions to tax, penalty or interest under the provisions of section 11-1936 of this subchapter.

(b) Exceptions. 

   (1) If before the expiration of the period of limitations for assessment of liability of the transferee, a claim has been filed by the commissioner in any court against the original taxpayer or the last preceding transferee based upon the liability of the original taxpayer, then the period of limitation for assessment of liability of the transferee shall in no event expire prior to one year after such claim has been finally allowed, disallowed or otherwise disposed of.

   (2) If, before the expiration of the time prescribed in subdivision (a) of this section or paragraph one of this subdivision for the assessment of the liability, the commissioner and the transferee have both consented in writing to its assessment after such time, the liability may be assessed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon may be extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. For the purpose of determining the period of limitation on credit or refund to the transferee of overpayments of tax made by such transferee or overpayments of tax made by the transferor as to which the transferee is legally entitled to credit or refund, such agreement and any extension thereof shall be deemed an agreement and extension thereof referred to in subdivision (b) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter. If the agreement is executed after the expiration of the period of limitation for assessment against the original taxpayer, then in applying the limitations under subdivision (b) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter on the amount of the credit or refund, the periods specified in subdivision (a) of section 11-1929 of this subchapter shall be increased by the period from the date of such expiration to the date of the agreement.

(c) Deceased transferor. If any person is deceased, the period of limitation for assessment against such person shall be the period that would be in effect if he or she had lived.

(d) Evidence. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-1942 of this subchapter, the commissioner shall use his or her powers to make available to the transferee evidence necessary to enable the transferee to determine the liability of the original taxpayer and of any preceding transferees, but without undue hardship to the original taxpayer or preceding transferee. See subdivision (e) of section 11-1931 of this subchapter for rule as to burden of proof.






*§ 11-1936 Liability of bulk transferees.* ::


Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof, whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee, that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether or not any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give the notice to the commissioner required by this section, or whenever the commissioner shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes, theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax is imposed under this chapter.






*§ 11-1937 Jeopardy determination or assessment.* ::


(a) Authority for making. If the commissioner believes that the assessment or collection of a deficiency will be jeopardized by delay, he or she shall, notwithstanding the provisions of sections 11-1923 and 11-1939 of this subchapter, immediately assess and/or proceed to collect such deficiency (together with all interest, penalties and additions to tax provided for by law), and notice and demand shall be made by the commissioner for the payment thereof.

(b) Notice of deficiency. If the jeopardy assessment is made before any notice in respect of the tax to which the jeopardy assessment relates has been mailed under section 11-1923 of this subchapter, then the commissioner shall mail a notice under such section within sixty days after making of the assessment.

(c) Amount assessable before decision of commissioner. The jeopardy assessment may be made in respect of a deficiency greater or less than that of which notice is mailed to the taxpayer and whether or not the taxpayer has therefor filed a petition with the commissioner. The commissioner may, at any time before rendering his or her decision, abate such assessment or any unpaid portion thereof, to the extent that he or she believes the assessment to be excessive in amount. The commissioner may in his or her decision redetermine the entire amount of the deficiency and of all amounts assessed at the same time in connection therewith.

(d) Amount assessable after decision of commissioner. If the jeopardy assessment of determination of jeopardy is made after the decision of the commissioner is rendered, such assessment or determination may be made only in respect of the deficiency determined by the commissioner in his or her decision.

(e) Expiration of right to assess. A jeopardy determination may not be made after the decision of the commissioner has become final or after the taxpayer has made an application for review of the decision of the commissioner.

(f) Collection of unpaid amounts. When a petition has been filed with the commissioner and when the amount which should have been assessed has been determined by a decision of the commissioner which has become final, then any unpaid portion, the collection of which has been stayed by bond, shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the commissioner, and any remaining portion of the assessment shall be abated. If the amount already collected exceeds the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed, such excess shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer as provided in section 11-1928 of this subchapter without the filing of claim therefor. If the amount determined as the amount which should have been assessed is greater than the amount actually assessed, then the difference shall be assessed and shall be collected as part of the tax upon notice and demand from the commissioner.

(g) Abatement if jeopardy does not exist. The commissioner may abate the jeopardy determination if he or she finds that jeopardy does not exist. Such abatement may not be made after a decision of the commissioner in respect of the deficiency has been rendered or, if no petition is filed with the commissioner, after the expiration of the period for filing such petition. The period of limitation on the making of a levy or a proceeding for collection, in respect of any deficiency, shall be determined as if the jeopardy assessment so abated has not been made, except that the running of such period shall in any event be suspended for the period from the date of such jeopardy determination until the expiration of the tenth day after the day on which such jeopardy determination is abated.

(h) Bond to stay collection. The collection of the whole or any amount of any assessment determined to be in jeopardy may be stayed by filing with the commissioner, within such time as may be fixed by regulation, a bond in an amount equal to the amount as to which the stay is desired conditioned upon the payment of the amount (together with interest thereon) the collection of which is stayed at the time at which, but for the making of the jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due. Upon the filing of the bond, the collection of so much of the amount assessed as is covered by the bond shall be stayed. The taxpayer shall have the right to waive such stay at any time in respect of the whole or any part of the amount covered by the bond and, if as a result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is paid, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced. If any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated, or if a notice of deficiency under section 11-1923 of this subchapter is mailed to the taxpayer in a lesser amount, the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced.

(i) Petition to commissioner. If the bond is given before the taxpayer has filed his or her petition under section 11-1931 of this subchapter, the bond shall contain a further condition that if a petition is not filed within the period provided in such section, then the amount, the collection of which is stayed by the bond, will be paid on notice and demand at any time after the expiration of such period, together with interest thereon from the date of the jeopardy notice and demand to the date of notice and demand under this subdivision. The bond shall be conditioned upon the payment of so much of such assessment (collection of which is stayed by the bond) as is not abated by a decision of the commissioner which has become final. If the commissioner determines that the amount assessed is greater than the amount which should have been assessed, then the bond shall, at the request of the taxpayer, be proportionately reduced when the decision of the commissioner is rendered.

(j) Stay of sale of seized property pending commissioner's decision. Where a jeopardy assessment or a determination of jeopardy is made, the property seized for the collection of the tax shall not be sold:

   (1) if subdivision (b) of this section is applicable, prior to the issuance of the notice of deficiency and the expiration of the time provided in section 11-1931 of this subchapter for filing a petition with the commissioner, and

   (2) if a petition is filed with the commissioner (whether before or after the making of such jeopardy assessment or determination), prior to the expiration of the period during which the collection of the deficiency assessed would be prohibited if subdivision (a) of this section were not applicable. Such property may be sold if the taxpayer consents to the sale, or if the commissioner determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will greatly reduce the net proceeds, or if the property is perishable.

(k) Interest. For the purpose of subdivision (a) of section 11-1926 of this subchapter, the last date prescribed for payment shall be determined without regard to any notice and demand for payment issued under this section prior to the last date otherwise prescribed for such payment.

(l) Early termination of taxable year. If the commissioner finds that a taxpayer designs quickly to depart from this state or to remove his or her property therefrom, or to conceal himself or herself or his or her property therein, or to do any other act tending to prejudice or to render wholly or partly ineffectual proceedings to collect the tax for the current or the preceding taxable year unless such proceedings be brought without delay, the commissioner shall declare the taxable period for such taxpayer immediately terminated, and shall cause notice of such finding and declaration to be given the taxpayer, together with a demand for immediate payment of the tax for the taxable period so declared terminated and of the tax for the preceding taxable year or so much of such tax as is unpaid, whether or not the time otherwise allowed by law for filing return and paying the tax has expired; and such taxes shall thereupon become immediately due and payable. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by virtue of the provisions of this subdivision, the finding of the commissioner made as herein provided, whether made after notice to the taxpayer or not, shall be for all purposes presumptive evidence of jeopardy.

(m) Reopening of taxable period. Notwithstanding the termination of the taxable period of the taxpayer by the commissioner as provided in subdivision (1), the commissioner may reopen such taxable period each time the taxpayer is found by the commissioner to have received wages or net earnings from self-employment, within the current taxable year, since the termination of such period. A taxable period so terminated by the commissioner may be reopened by the taxpayer if he or she files with the commissioner a true and accurate return of taxable wages and net earnings from self-employment under this chapter for such taxable period, together with such other information as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe.

(n) Furnishing of bond where taxable year is closed by the commissioner. Payment of taxes shall not be enforced by any proceedings under the provisions of subdivision (1) prior to the expiration of the time otherwise allowed for paying such taxes if the taxpayer furnishes, under regulations prescribed by the commissioner, a bond to insure the timely making of returns with respect to, and payment of, such taxes or any taxes for prior years.






*§ 11-1938 Criminal penalties.* ::


(a) Attempt to evade tax. Any individual, corporation or partnership or any officer or employee of any corporation, or member or employee of any partnership, who, with intent to evade any tax or any requirement of this chapter or any lawful requirement of the commissioner thereunder, shall fail to pay the tax, or to make, render, sign or certify any return or declaration of estimated tax, or to supply any information within the time required by or under the provisions of this chapter, or who, with like intent, shall make, render, sign or certify any false or fraudulent return, declaration or statement, or shall supply any false or fraudulent information, or who shall fail to comply with the provisions of subdivision (b) of section 11-1912 of this chapter after the service of a notice by the commissioner thereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall, upon conviction, be fined not to exceed five thousand dollars or be imprisoned not to exceed one year, or both, at the discretion of the court.

(b) Limitations. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 30.10 of the criminal procedure law or of any other law of this state, a prosecution for any offense under this section may be commenced at any time not later than three years after the commission of such offense provided that, if such offense is the failure to do an act required by or under any provision of this chapter to be done before a certain date, a prosecution for such offense may be commenced not later than three years after such date.

(c) Willful failure to withhold. Any individual, corporation or partnership or any officer or employee of any corporation (including a dissolved corporation), or member or employee of any partnership, who willfully fails to collect or pay over any withholding tax as required, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not to exceed five thousand dollars or imprisoned not to exceed one year, or both.

(d) Two or more charges. In the prosecution of offenses under this section, if there are two or more charges against any person or corporation, involving a violation or violations of any provision or provisions of this chapter, whether for the same or different taxable years, instead of returning several indictments or filing several informations, all of such charges may be joined in one indictment or information, in separate counts, and if two or more indictments are found, or two or more informations are filed, the court may order them to be consolidated. If a person or corporation shall be convicted of two or more offenses constituting different crimes set forth in different counts of one indictment or information, or in separate indictments or informations consolidated as hereinbefore provided, the court may impose a separate sentence for each offense, and if imprisonment is imposed, the court may order any of such sentences to be served concurrently or consecutively.

(e) Miscellaneous rules. Any prosecution under this section may be conducted in any county where the person or corporation to whose tax liability the proceeding relates resides, or has a place of business, or in any county in which any such crime is committed. The corporation counsel of the city shall have concurrent jurisdiction with any district attorney in the prosecution of any offense under this section. If the provisions of this section conflict with those contained in any other law, this section shall control. The certificate of the commissioner to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return or declaration of estimated tax has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied, as required by or under the provisions of this chapter, shall be prima facie evidence that such tax has not been paid, that such return or declaration has not been filed, or that such information has not been supplied. All fines levied under this section shall be paid to the commissioner and deposited in the same manner as revenues collected or received under this chapter.






*§ 11-1939 Armed forces relief provisions.* ::


(a) Time to be disregarded. In the case of an individual serving in the armed forces of the United States or serving in support of such armed forces, in an area designated by the president of the United States by executive order as a "combat zone" at any time during the period designated by the president by executive order as the period of combatant activities in such zone, or hospitalized outside the state as a result of injury received while serving in such an area during such time, the period of service in such area, plus the period of continuous hospitalized outside the state attributable to such injury, and the next one hundred eighty days thereafter, shall be disregarded in determining, under this chapter in respect of the tax liability (including any interest, penalty, or addition to the tax) of such individual:

   (1) Whether any of the following acts was performed within the time prescribed therefor:

      (A) filing any return of tax (except withholding tax);

      (B) payment of any tax (except withholding tax) or any installment thereof or of any other liability to the commissioner, in respect thereof;

      (C) filing a petition with the commissioner for credit or refund or for redetermination of a deficiency, or application for review of a decision rendered by the commissioner;

      (D) allowance of a credit or refund of tax;

      (E) filing a claim for credit or refund of tax;

      (H) bringing suit by the city, or any officer, on its behalf, in respect of any liability in respect of tax; and

      (I) any other act required or permitted under this chapter or specified in the regulations prescribed under this section by the commissioner.

   (2) The amount of any credit or refund (including interest).

(b) Action taken before ascertainment of right to benefits. The collection of the tax imposed by this chapter or of any liability to the commissioner in respect of such tax, or any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the commissioner in connection therewith, may be made, taken, begun, or prosecuted in accordance with law, without regard to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, unless prior to such collection, action, or proceeding it is ascertained that the person concerned is entitled to the benefit of subdivision (a).

(c) Members of armed forces dying in action. In the case of any person who dies while in active service as a member of the armed forces of the United States, if such death occurred while serving in a combat zone during a period of combatant activities in such zone, as described in subdivision (a) of this section, or as a result of wounds, disease or injury incurred while so serving, the tax imposed by this chapter shall not apply with respect to the taxable year in which falls the date of his or her death, or with respect to any prior taxable year ending on or after the first day so served in a combat zone, and no returns shall be required in behalf of such person or his or her estate for such year; and the tax for any such taxable year which is unpaid at the date of death, including interest, additions to tax and penalties, if any, shall not be assessed and, if assessed, the assessment shall be abated and, if collected, shall be refunded to the legal representative of such estate if one has been appointed and has qualified, or, if no legal representative has been appointed or has qualified, to the surviving spouse.






*§ 11-1940 General powers of commissioner.* ::


(a) General. The commissioner shall administer and enforce the tax imposed by this chapter and the commissioner is authorized to make such rules and regulations, and to require such facts and information to be reported, as the commissioner may deem necessary to enforce the provisions of this chapter and the commissioner may delegate his or her powers and functions under all subchapters of this chapter to one of his or her deputies or to any employee or employees of his or her department.

(b) Examination of books and witnesses. The commissioner for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return, or for the purpose of making an estimate of taxable wages and net earnings from self-employment of any person, shall have power to examine or to cause to have examined, by any agent or representative designated by him or her for that purpose, any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the matters required to be included in the return, and may require the attendance of the person rendering the return or any officer or employee of such person, or the attendance of any other person having knowledge in the premises, may take testimony and require proof material for the commissioner's information, with power to administer oaths to such person or persons and may issue commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of the state or unable to attend before the commissioner or excused from attendance, and for the production of books, papers, records or memoranda.

(c) Abatement authority. The commissioner, of his or her own motion, may abate any small unpaid balance of an assessment of tax, or any liability in respect thereof, if the commissioner determines under uniform rules prescribed by him or her that the administration and collection costs involved would not warrant collection of the amount due. The commissioner may also abate, of his or her own motion, the unpaid portion of the assessment of any tax or any liability in respect thereof, which is excessive in amount, or is assessed after the expiration of the period of limitation properly applicable thereto, or is erroneously or illegally assessed. No claim for abatement under this subdivision shall be filed by a taxpayer.

(d) Special refund authority. Where no questions of fact or law are involved and it appears from the records of the commissioner that any moneys have been erroneously or illegally collected from any taxpayer or other person, or paid by such taxpayer or other person under a mistake of facts, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, the commissioner at any time, without regard to any period of limitations, shall have the power, upon making a record of his or her reasons therefor in writing, to cause such moneys so paid and being erroneously and illegally held to be refunded.

(e) Cooperation with the United States and other states. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 11-1942 of this subchapter, the commissioner may permit the secretary of the treasury of the United States or such secretary's delegates, or the proper tax officer of any other state imposing an income tax upon the income of individuals, or the authorized representative of either such officer, to inspect any return filed under this chapter, or may furnish to such officer or his or her authorized representative an abstract of any such return or supply him or her with information concerning an item contained in any such return, or disclosed by any investigation of tax liability under this chapter, but such permission shall be granted or such information furnished to such officer or his or her representative only if the laws of the United States or of such state, as the case may be, grant substantially similar privileges to the commissioner and such information is to be used for tax purposes only; and provided further the commissioner may furnish to the commissioner of internal revenue or his or her authorized representative such returns filed under this chapter and other tax information as he or she may consider proper for the use in court actions or proceedings under the internal revenue code, whether civil or criminal, where a written request therefor has been made to the commissioner by the secretary of the treasury of the United States or by his or her delegates, provided the laws of the United States grant substantially similar powers to the secretary of the treasury of the United States or such secretary's delegates. Where the commissioner has so authorized use of returns and other information in such actions or proceedings, officers and employees of the department of taxation and finance may testify in such actions or proceedings in respect to such returns or other information.






*§ 11-1941 Joint enforcement.* ::


(1) If there is assessed a tax under this chapter and there is also assessed a tax or taxes against the same taxpayer pursuant to article twenty-two of the tax law and if the commissioner of the tax imposed by this chapter takes action under the tax law with respect to the enforcement and collection of the tax or taxes assessed under such tax law, the commissioner shall, wherever possible, accompany such action with a similar action under similar enforcement and collection provisions of this chapter.

(2) Any monies collected as a result of such joint action shall be deemed to have been collected in proportion in the amounts due, including tax, penalties, interest and additions to tax under article twenty-two of the tax law and under this chapter.

(3) Whenever the commissioner takes any action with respect to a deficiency of personal income tax, under article twenty-two of the tax law other than the action set forth in subdivision one of this section the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, accompany such action with a similar action under this chapter.






*§ 11-1942 Secrecy requirement and penalties for violation.* ::


1. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner or any other officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, any person engaged or retained by such commissioner or department on an independent contract basis, any depository to which any return may be delivered as provided in subdivision two of this section, any officer or employee of such depository, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any report or return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any report or return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any report or return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of wages or earnings or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any report or return required under this chapter. The commissioner or any other officer and employee charged with the custody of such reports and returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the city in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or in any other action or proceeding involving the collection of a tax due under this chapter to which the city is a party or a claimant, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the reports, returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in any of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said reports, returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more; except as provided in subdivision (e) of section 11-1940 of this subchapter. The commissioner may, nevertheless, publish a copy or a summary of any determination or decision rendered after the hearing required under section 11-1931 of this subchapter of this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayers's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return or report filed in connection with his or her tax or to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular reports or returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the legal representatives of the city of the report or return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter has been recommended by the commissioner. Reports and returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner orders them to be destroyed. Any violation of the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both, at the discretion of the court, and if the offender be the commissioner or any other officer or employee of the city, he or she shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in the city or the state for a period of five years thereafter.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one of this section, the commissioner of finance, in his or her discretion, may require or permit any or all individuals, estates or trusts, liable for any tax imposed by this chapter, to make payments on account of estimated tax and payment of any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter to banks, banking houses or trust companies designated by the commissioner of finance and to file declarations of estimated tax and reports and returns with such banks, banking houses or trust companies as agents of the commissioner of finance, in lieu of making any such payment directly to the commissioner of finance. However, the commissioner of finance shall designate only such banks, banking houses or trust companies as are depositories or financial agents of the city.






*§ 11-1943 Provisions not applicable.* ::


The provisions contained in this subchapter shall not be applicable with respect to taxes imposed for taxable periods commencing on or after January first, nineteen hundred seventy-six but, with respect to the tax imposed for such periods the provisions contained in part VI of article twenty-two of the tax law and sections six hundred fifty-three, six hundred fifty-eight, six hundred sixty-two and thirteen hundred eleven of the tax law including the provisions of judicial review by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall be applicable with the same force and effect as if those provisions had been incorporated in full in this section except where inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter.






*§ 11-1944 Deposit and disposition of revenues by commissioner.* ::


All taxes, penalties and interest imposed under this chapter which are paid to or collected by the commissioner of finance shall be deposited by the commissioner of finance in the general fund of the city.






*§ 11-1945 Effect of invalidity in part; inconsistencies with other laws.* ::


(a) If any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, provision or other portion of this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be held to be invalid, such holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this chapter or the application of such portion held invalid, to any other person or circumstances, but shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section, provision or other portion thereof directly involved in such holding or to the person and circumstances therein involved.

(b) If any provision of this chapter is inconsistent with, in conflict with, or contrary to any other provision of law, such provision of this chapter shall prevail over such other provision and such other provision shall be deemed to have been amended, superseded or repealed to the extent of such inconsistency, conflict or contrariety.

Such deposits shall be kept in trust and separate and apart from all other monies in the possession of the comptroller. The comptroller shall require adequate security from all such depositories of such revenues collected by the tax commission. The comptroller shall retain in his or her hands such amount as the commissioner of taxation and finance may determine to be necessary for refunds in respect of the taxes imposed by this subchapter, and for reasonable costs of the state tax commission in administering, collecting and distributing such taxes, out of which the comptroller shall pay any refunds of such taxes to which taxpayers shall be entitled under the provisions of this subchapter. The comptroller, after reserving such refund and such costs shall, on or before the twelfth day of each month, pay to the commissioner of finance the taxes penalties and interest imposed by this subchapter, collected by the state tax commission pursuant to this subchapter during the next preceding calendar month. The amount so payable shall be certified to the comptroller by the president of the state tax commission or his or her delegate, who shall not be held liable for any inaccuracy in such certificate.

The amount of the overpayment or underpayment shall be so certified to the comptroller as soon after the discovery of the overpayment or underpayment as reasonably possible and subsequent payments and distributions by the comptroller to the city shall be adjusted by subtracting the amount of any such overpayment from or by adding the amount of any such underpayment to such number of subsequent payments and distributions as the comptroller and the president of the state tax commission shall consider reasonable in view of the amount of the overpayment or underpayment and all other facts or circumstances.

Where any real property is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries of the city of New York the consideration and net consideration subject to tax shall be such part of the total consideration and total net consideration attributable to that portion of such real property situated within the city of New York or to the interest in such portion.

b. (1) In addition to the taxes imposed by subdivision a, there is hereby imposed a tax on each instrument or transaction (unless evidenced by a deed subject to tax under subdivision a), at the time of the transfer, whereby any economic interest in real property is transferred by a grantor to a grantee, where the consideration exceeds twenty-five thousand dollars.

      (A) With respect to such transfers made on or after July thirteenth, nineteen hundred eighty-six and before August first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine, the tax shall be (i) at the rate of one percent of the consideration where the real property the economic interest in which is transferred is a one, two or three-family house, an individual cooperative apartment, an individual residential condominium unit or an individual dwelling unit in a dwelling which is to be occupied or is occupied as the residence or home of four or more families living independently of each other, or where the consideration for the transfer is less than five hundred thousand dollars; and (ii) at the rate of two percent of the consideration with respect to all other transfers.

      (B) With respect to such transfers made on or after August first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine, the tax shall be at the following rates:

         (i) at the rate of one percent of the consideration where the real property, the economic interest in which is transferred, is a one, two or three-family house, an individual cooperative apartment, an individual residential condominium unit or an individual dwelling unit in a dwelling which is to be occupied or is occupied as the residence or home of four or more families living independently of each other and where the consideration for such transfer of an economic interest in such real property is five hundred thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of one and four hundred twenty-five thousandths of one percent of the consideration where the consideration for such transfer of an economic interest in such property is more than five hundred thousand dollars, and

         (ii) at the rate of one and four hundred twenty-five thousandths of one percent of the consideration with respect to all other transfers of an economic interest in real property where the consideration is five hundred thousand dollars or less, and at the rate of two and six hundred twenty-five thousandths of one percent of the consideration where the consideration for such transfers is more than five hundred thousand dollars.

      (C) Where any real property, the economic interest in which is transferred, is situated partly within and partly without the boundaries of the city of New York, the consideration subject to tax shall be such part of the consideration as is attributable to that portion of such real property which is situated within the city of New York.

   (2) Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling interest" contained in paragraph eight of section 11-2101 or anything to the contrary contained in paragraph seven of that section, in the case of any transfer of stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold, the tax imposed by this subdivision shall apply to (i) the original transfer of such shares of stock by the cooperative corporation or cooperative plan sponsor, and (ii) any subsequent transfer of such shares of stock by the owner thereof. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, in the case of a transfer described in clause (ii) of this paragraph which relates to an individual residential unit, the consideration for such transfer shall not include any portion of the unpaid principal of any mortgage on the real property of the cooperative housing corporation. In determining the tax on a transfer described in clause (i) of this paragraph, a credit shall be allowed for a proportionate part of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation of the land and building or buildings comprising the cooperative dwelling or dwellings. Such proportionate part shall be the amount determined by multiplying the amount of tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative housing corporation by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of stock transferred in a transaction described in clause (i) and the denominator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of stock of the cooperative housing corporation (including any stock held by the corporation). In no event, however, shall such credit reduce the tax on a transfer described in clause (i) below zero, nor shall any such credit be allowed for any tax paid more than twenty-four months prior to the date on which occurs the first in a series of transfers of shares of stock in an offering of cooperative housing corporation shares described in clause (i). For purposes of this paragraph, the term "cooperative housing corporation" shall not include a housing company organized and operating pursuant to the provisions of article two, four, five or eleven of the private housing finance law.

   (3) Notwithstanding the definition of "controlling interest" contained in paragraph eight of section 11-2101 or anything to the contrary contained in paragraph seven of that section, in the case of a corporation (other than a cooperative housing corporation), partnership,association, trust or other entity formed for the purpose of cooperative ownership of real property, the tax imposed by this subdivision shall apply to each transfer of shares of stock in such corporation, interest in such partnership, association or other entity or beneficial interest in such trust, in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold. Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, in the case of a transfer described in this paragraph which relates to an individual residential unit (other than the original transfer of such a unit by the cooperative entity or cooperative plan sponsor), the consideration for such transfer shall not include any portion of the unpaid principal of any mortgage on the real property of such corporation, partnership, association, trust or other entity. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, all revenues arising from the tax imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited to and deposited in the general fund of the city, but no part of such revenues may be expended unless appropriated in the annual budget of the city.

c. (1) Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, in the case of any conveyance or transfer of real property or any economic interest therein in complete or partial liquidation of a corporation, partnership, association, trust or other entity, the taxes imposed by this section shall be measured by (i) the consideration for such conveyance or transfer, or (ii) the value of the real property or economic interest therein, whichever is greater.

   (2) If, within twenty-four months following the transfer of an economic interest in real property which is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter, the corporation, partnership, association, trust or other entity owning the real property the economic interest in which was so transferred, is liquidated, and such real property is conveyed to the grantee or grantees of such economic interest, a credit shall be allowed against the tax imposed by this chapter upon such conveyance in liquidation to such grantee or grantees. The amount of such credit shall be equal to the amount of the tax paid upon the prior transfer of the economic interest in such real property, but shall in no event be greater than the tax payable upon the conveyance in liquidation.

d. In the case of a transfer of an economic interest in any entity that owns assets in addition to real property or interest therein, the consideration subject to tax shall be deemed equal to the fair market value of the real property or interest therein apportioned based on the percentage of the ownership interest in the entity transferred.

e. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the tax imposed under subdivisions a and b on any deed or other instrument or transaction conveying or transferring real property or an economic interest therein, that qualifies as a real estate investment trust transfer, as defined below, shall be imposed at a rate equal to fifty percent of the otherwise applicable rate.

   (2) For purposes of this subdivision e, a real estate investment trust transfer shall mean

      (A) any deed or other instrument or transaction conveying or transferring real property or an economic interest therein to a real estate investment trust as defined in section eight hundred fifty-six of the internal revenue code (a "REIT") or to a partnership or corporation in which a REIT owns a controlling interest immediately following the transaction; and

      (B) any issuance or transfer of an interest in a REIT, or in a partnership or corporation in which a REIT owns a controlling interest immediately following the issuance or transfer in connection with a transaction described in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction described in the preceding sentence shall not constitute a real estate investment trust transfer unless (i) it occurs in connection with the initial formation of the REIT and the conditions described in subparagraphs (C) and (D) of this paragraph are satisfied, or (ii) in the case of any real estate investment trust transfer occurring on or after July thirteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-six and before September first, two thousand twenty-three, the transaction is described in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph in which case the provision of such subparagraph shall apply.

      (C) The value of the ownership interests in the REIT, or in a partnership or corporation in which the REIT owns a controlling interest, received by the grantor as consideration for such conveyance or transfer must be equal to an amount not less than forty percent of the value of the equity interest in the real property or economic interest therein conveyed or transferred by the grantor to the grantee and such ownership interests must be retained by the grantor or owners of the grantor for a period of not less than two years following the date of such conveyance or transfer; provided, however, that in the case of the death of the grantor or an owner of the grantor within such two year period, this two year retention requirement shall be deemed to be satisfied notwithstanding any conveyance or transfer of such ownership interests held by such individual as a result of such death. The value of the equity interest in such real property or economic interest therein shall be computed by subtracting from the consideration for the conveyance or transfer of the real property or economic interest therein the unpaid balance of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances which are liens on the real property or economic interest therein immediately before the conveyance or transfer. For purposes of this computation, in the case of a conveyance or transfer of real property other than a conveyance or transfer of an economic interest in real property, the amount of the unpaid balance of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances to be subtracted from consideration is determined by multiplying the total unpaid balance of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances on the real property by the percentage of the ownership interest in the real property being conveyed or transferred to the grantee. In the case of a transfer of an economic interest in real property, such amount to be subtracted is equal to the sum of the following amounts: (i) a reasonable apportionment to the interests in real property owned by the entity of the amount of any loans secured by encumbrances on the ownership interests in the entity which are being conveyed or transferred and (ii) the amount of any loans secured by mortgages or other encumbrances on the real property of the entity multiplied by the percentage interest in the entity which is being conveyed or transferred. Provided, however, that for purposes of the computation made pursuant to this subparagraph (C), any mortgages or other encumbrances on the real property or economic interest therein which are created in contemplation of the initial formation of the REIT or in contemplation of the conveyance or transfer of such real property or economic interest therein to the REIT or to a partnership or corporation in which the FEIT owns a controlling interest immediately following the conveyance or transfer shall not be considered.

      (D) Seventy-five percent or more of the cash proceeds received by such REIT from the sale of ownership interests in such REIT upon its initial formation must be used: (i) to make payments on loans secured by any interest in real property (including an ownership interest in an entity owning real property) which is owned directly or indirectly by such REIT; (ii) to pay for capital improvements to real property or any interest therein owned directly or indirectly by such REIT; (iii) to pay brokerage fees and commissions, professional fees and payments to or on behalf of a tenant as an inducement to enter into a lease or sublease incurred in connection with the creation of a leasehold or sublease pertaining to real property or any interest therein owned directly or indirectly by such REIT; (iv) to acquire any interest in real property (including an ownership interest in any entity owning real property), apart from any acquisition to which a reduced rate of tax is applicable pursuant to this subdivision (without regard to this subparagraph); or (v) for reserves established for any of the purposes described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subparagraph. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term real property shall include real property wherever located.

      (E) If a transaction otherwise described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph occurs other than in connection with the initial formation of a REIT, the condition set forth in subparagraph (D) shall be disregarded and such transaction shall constitute a "real estate investment trust transfer" if the condition set forth in subparagraph (C) would be satisfied if "fifty percent" is substituted for "forty percent" therein.

   (3) For purposes of determining the consideration for a real estate investment trust transfer taxable under this subdivision e the value of the real property or interest therein shall be equal to the estimated market value as determined by the commissioner of finance for real property tax purposes as reflected on the most recent notice of assessment issued by such commissioner, or such other value as the taxpayer may establish to the satisfaction of such commissioner.

   (4) This subdivision e shall only apply to real estate investment trust transfers occurring on or after the effective date of this subdivision.

f. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in determining the tax imposed by this chapter with respect to a deed, instrument or transaction conveying or transferring a one, two or three-family house, an individual residential condominium unit, an individual residential cooperative apartment, or an interest therein, the consideration for such conveyance or transfer shall exclude, to the extent otherwise included therein, the amount of any mortgage or other lien or encumbrance on the real property or interest therein that existed before the delivery of the deed or the transfer and remains thereon after the date of delivery of the deed or the transfer, other than any mortgage, lien or encumbrance placed on the property or interest in connection with, or in anticipation of, the conveyance or transfer, or by reason of deferred payments of the purchase price whether represented by notes or otherwise. Provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to a conveyance or transfer (1) to a mortgagee, lienor or encumbrancer, regardless of whether the grantor or transferor is or was personally liable for the indebtedness secured by the mortgage, lien or encumbrance or whether the mortgage, lien or encumbrance is canceled of record, or (2) which qualifies as a "real estate investment trust transfer" as defined in subdivision e of this section.








*§ 11-2103 Presumptions and burden of proof.* ::


For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all deeds and transfers of economic interests in real property are taxable. Where the consideration includes property other than money, it shall be presumed that the consideration is the value of the real property or interest therein. Such presumption shall prevail until the contrary is established and the burden of proving the contrary shall be on the taxpayer. The burden of proving that a lien or encumbrance existed on the real property or interest therein before the delivery of the deed and remained thereon thereafter and the burden of proving the amount of such lien or encumbrance at the time of the delivery of the deed shall be on the taxpayer.






*§ 11-2104 Payment.* ::


The tax imposed hereunder shall be paid by the grantor to the commissioner of finance at the office of the register in the county where the deed is or would be recorded within thirty days after the delivery of the deed by the grantor to the grantee but before the recording of such deed, or, in the case of a tax on the transfer of an economic interest in real property, at such place as the commissioner of finance shall designate, within thirty days after the transfer. The grantee shall also be liable for the payment of such tax in the event that the amount of tax due is not paid by the grantor or the grantor is exempt from tax. All moneys received as such payments by the register during the preceding month shall be transmitted to the commissioner of finance on the first day of each month or on such other day as is mutually agreeable to the commissioner of finance and the register.

(2) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph four of subdivision a of section 11-2102 of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, provided, however, that where such tax is measured by the consideration for a conveyance without deduction for the amount of any mortgage or other lien or encumbrance on the real property or interest therein which existed before the delivery of the deed and remains thereon after the delivery of the deed, the entire amount of tax imposed at the rate of one percent on the portion of the consideration ascribable to such nondeductible mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, including any interest or penalties thereon, and fifty percent of the tax on the balance of the consideration, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, shall be set aside in such special account;

(3) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph (iii) of paragraph seven of subdivision a of section 11-2102 of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon;

(4) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph eight of subdivision a of section 11-2102 of this chapter, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon;

(5) fifty percent of the total amount of taxes imposed at the rate of two percent pursuant to the provisions of clause (ii) of subparagraph A of paragraph one of subdivision b of section 11-2102 of this chapter including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon;

(6) with respect to any conveyance of real property, transfer of an economic interest therein, or any grant, assignment or surrender of a leasehold interest in real property, made on or after August first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine and taxable under this chapter, in each instance where the tax rate is in excess of two percent, a portion of the tax received equal to one percent of the consideration subject to the tax plus any interest or penalty attributable to such portion of the tax; and

(7) notwithstanding anything in subdivision six to the contrary, in each instance where the tax rate imposed pursuant to subdivision e of section 11-2102 of this chapter is in excess of one percent, a portion of the tax received equal to one-half of one percent of the total consideration for the real property or economic interest therein conveyed or transferred, plus any interest or penalty attributable to such portion of the tax. Moneys in such account shall be used for payment by such commissioner to the state comptroller for deposit in the urban mass transit operating assistance acount of the mass transportation operating assistance fund of any amount of insufficiency certified by the state comptroller pursuant to the provisions of subdivision six of section eight-eight-a of the state finance law, and, on the fifteenth day of each month, the commissioner of finance shall transmit all funds in such account on the last day of the preceding month, except the amount required for the payment of any amount of insufficiency certified by the state comptroller and such amount as he or she deems necessary for refunds and such other amounts necessary to finance the New York City transportation disabled committee and the New York City paratransit system as established by section fifteen-b of the transportation law, provided, however, that such amounts shall not exceed six percent of the total funds in the account but in no event be less than one hundred seventy-five thousand dollars beginning April first, nineteen hundred eighty-six, and further that beginning November fifteenth, nineteen hundred eighty-four and during the entire period prior to operation of such system, the total of such amounts shall not exceed three hundred seventy-five thousand dollars for the administrative expenses of such committee and fifty thousand dollars for the expenses of the agency designated pursuant to paragraph b of subdivision five of such section, and other amounts necessary to finance the operating needs of the private bus companies franchised by the city of New York and eligible to receive state operating assistance under section eighteen-b of the transportation law, provided, however, that such amounts shall not exceed four percent of the total funds in the account, to the New York city transit authority for mass transit within the city.






*§ 11-2105 Returns.* ::


a. A joint return shall be filed by both the grantor and the grantee for each deed whether or not a tax is due thereon. Such return shall be filed with the commissioner of finance within thirty days after the delivery of the deed by the grantor to the grantee but before the recording of such deed. The commissioner of finance may, by rule, require that such returns be filed electronically. Filing shall be accomplished by delivering the return to the register for transmittal to the commissioner of finance or, where required by the commissioner of finance, by electronic filing of the return in a manner designated by the commissioner of finance. In the case of a transfer of an economic interest in real property, a joint return shall be filed in the above manner by both the grantor and the grantee for each instrument or transaction by which such transfer is effected, whether or not a tax is due thereon. Such return shall be filed with the commissioner of finance, at such place and in such manner as he or she may designate within thirty days after the transfer.

Where the commissioner of finance requires electronic filing, the return shall be signed electronically. Upon the filing of such return for a deed, evidence of the filing shall be affixed to the deed by the register. The commissioner of finance may provide for the use of stamps as evidence of payment and that they shall be affixed to the deed before it is recorded. Where either the grantor or grantee has failed to sign the return, it shall be accepted as a return, but the party who has failed to sign the return or file a separate return shall be subject to the penalties applicable to a person who has failed to file a return and the period of limitations for assessment of tax or of additional tax shall not apply to such party. For good cause, the commissioner of finance may waive any rule requiring electronic filing and may permit a return to be filed in such other manner as the commissioner of finance may designate.

b. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner of finance permits them to be destroyed.

c. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.

d. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or of a corrected return.

e. Where a deed, or instrument or transaction has more than one grantor or more than one grantee, the return may be signed by any one of the grantors and by any one of the grantees, provided, however, that those not signing shall not be relieved of any liability for the tax imposed by this chapter.

f. The payment of, and the filing of returns relating to, the taxes imposed hereunder, shall be required as a condition precedent to the recording or filing of a deed, lease, assignment or surrender of lease or other instrument effecting a conveyance or transfer subject to such taxes.

g.*   Every cooperative housing corporation shall be required to file an information return with the commissioner of finance as follows: such information return shall be filed by February fifteenth of the year two thousand and of each year thereafter, covering the reporting period beginning on January sixth of the year preceding the filing and ending on January fifth of the year of the filing. For reporting periods beginning before January sixth, nineteen hundred ninety-nine, such information return shall be filed by July fifteenth of each year covering the preceding period of January first through June thirtieth and by January fifteenth of each year covering the preceding period of July first through December thirty-first provided, however, that for the reporting period from January first through June thirtieth, nineteen hundred eighty-nine, such information return shall be filed by July thirty-first, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The return shall contain such information regarding the transfer of shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation as the commissioner may deem necessary, including but not limited to, the names, addresses and employer identification numbers or social security numbers of the grantor and the grantee, the number of shares transferred, the date of the transfer and the consideration paid for such transfer, provided, however, that if such cooperative housing corporation elects that such information return be deemed an application for an abatement pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision three of section four hundred sixty-seven-a of the real property tax law, such return shall contain the information required pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision three of such section. The commissioner of finance may enter into an agreement with the commissioner of taxation and finance of the state of New York to provide that a single information return may be filed for purposes of the tax imposed by this chapter and the real estate transfer tax imposed by article thirty-one of the tax law.

* Editor's note: there are two divisions designated g in this section.

h. When the grantor or grantee of a deed for residential real property containing one- to four-family dwelling units is a limited liability company, the joint return shall not be accepted for filing unless it is accompanied by a document which identifies the names and business addresses of all members, managers, and any other authorized persons, if any, of such limited liability company and the names and business addresses or, if none, the business addresses of all shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers and partners of any limited liability company or other business entity that are to be the members, managers or authorized persons, if any, of such limited liability company. The identification of such names and addresses shall not be deemed an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy pursuant to article six of the public officers law. If any such member, manager or authorized person of the limited liability company is itself a limited liability company or other business entity, the names and addresses of the shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers and partners of the limited liability company or other business entity shall also be disclosed until full disclosure of ultimate ownership by natural persons is achieved. For purposes of this subdivision, the terms "members", "managers", "authorized person", "limited liability company" and "other business entity" shall have the same meaning as those terms are defined in section one hundred two of the limited liability company law.

This subdivision shall apply to transfers occurring on or after June sixteenth, nineteen hundred ninety-two.








*§ 11-2107 Determination of tax.* ::


If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information as may be obtainable, including the assessed valuation of the real property or interest therein. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or, unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed and to the commissioner of finance. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of the taxpayer such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and intterest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-2108 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, the commissioner shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. Such application may be made by the grantor, grantee or other person who has actually paid the tax. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review such decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2107 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-2107 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing, or on the commissioner of finance's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-2109 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the grantor or grantee has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to him or her on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-2110 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-2107 and 11-2108 of this chapter shall be exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2107 of this chapter.






*§ 11-2111 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any grantor or grantee shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such grantor or grantee subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, such commissioner may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the grantor, grantee or other person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrant he or she shall be entitled to the same fees, which such sheriff may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.






*§ 11-2112 General powers of the commissioner of finance.* ::


In addition to the powers granted to the commissioner of finance in this chapter, he or she is hereby authorized and empowered:

The commissioner of finance, his or her employees or agents duly designated and authorized by him or her, the tax appeals tribunal and any of its duly designated and authorized employees or agents shall have power to administer oaths and take affidavits in relation to any matter or proceeding in the exercise of their powers and duties under this chapter. The commissioner of finance and the tax appeals tribunal shall have power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents to secure information pertinent to the performance of the duties of the commissioner or of the tax appeals tribunal hereunder and of the enforcement of this chapter and to examine them in relation thereto, and to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of the state or unable to attend before such commissioner or the tax appeals tribunal or excused from attendance.

d. The officers who serve the summons or subpoena of the commissioner of finance or the tax appeals tribunal and witnesses attending in response thereto shall be entitled to the same fees as are allowed to officers and witnesses in civil cases in courts of record, except as herein otherwise provided.

For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.

   (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.

(e) Additional penalty. Any person who, with fraudulent intent, shall fail to pay any tax imposed by this chapter, or to make, render, sign or certify any return, or to supply any information within the time required by or under this chapter, shall be liable for a penalty of not more than one thousand dollars, in addition to any other amounts required under this chapter to be imposed, assessed and collected by the commissioner of finance. The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

Such rate shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.

The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. Except as otherwise provided in this subdivision, if any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal. Any return filed electronically shall be deemed to be filed on the date of issuance by the commissioner of finance of a confirmation.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

If the commissioner of finance is designated as the agent of the commissioner of motor vehicles, such a determination by the commissioner of finance shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after the giving of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) applies to the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing by filing a petition, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same.

Whenever a refund is made or denied, the reasons therefor shall be stated in writing by the commissioner of motor vehicles or by the commissioner of finance, as the case may be, who in lieu of any refund, may allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. (1) If the commissioner of motor vehicles has not designated the commissioner of finance as his or her agent, an application for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of and the commissioner of motor vehicles shall hold a hearing and receive evidence with respect thereto. After such hearing, the commissioner of motor vehicles shall give notice of the determination of such application to the applicant who shall be entitled to review such determination by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of notice of such determination, and provided that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of motor vehicles in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such pro- ceeding.

   (2) If the commissioner of motor vehicles has designated the commissioner of finance as his or her agent, a determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the administrative code and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accorrdance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing.

After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking shall first be filed with the commissioner of motor vehicles, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which has been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2206 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination made pursuant to section 11-2206 of this chapter, unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper after a hearing, or on his or her own motion, by the commissioner of motor vehicles or after a hearing by the tax appeals tribunal, or on his or her own motion by the commissioner of finance, as the case may be, or in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-2209 Reserves.* ::

*§ 11-2210 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-2206 and 11-2208 of this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of motor vehicles or by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a final determination by the commissioner of motor vehicles or a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of motor vehicles prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2206 of this chapter.






*§ 11-2211 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel, upon the request of the commissioner of motor vehicles or of the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, shall bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state of the United States. However, if in his or her discretion the commissioner of motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, believes that any such person subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the person who issued it and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrant such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of motor vehicles, or of the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent, a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance of the city, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of motor vehicles or the commissioner of finance, as the case may be, may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if he or she had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.






*§ 11-2212 General powers of the commissioner of motor vehicles.* ::

6. To require all persons owning motor vehicles subject to tax to keep such records as he or she may prescribe and to furnish such information upon his or her request;

a. The commissioner of motor vehicles or his or her employees or agents duly designated and authorized by such commissioner, and the tax appeals tribunal, shall have power to administer oaths and take affidavits in relation to any matter or proceeding in the exercise of the powers and duties under this chapter. The commissioner of motor vehicles, or the commissioner of finance if designated as his or her agent or the tax appeals tribunal, shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and documents to secure information pertinent to the performance of the duties of the commissioner of motor vehicles, the commissioner of finance or the tax appeals tribunal hereunder and of the enforcement of this chapter and to examine them in relation thereto, and to issue commissions for the examination of witnesses who are out of the state or unable to attend before him or her or the tax appeals tribunal or excused from attendance.

A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner and there shall be filed with the commissioner an undertaking issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceedings or (b) at the option of the taxpayer, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, interest and penalties stated in such decision, plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event the taxpayer shall not be required to pay such taxes, interest or penalties as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-2408 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section, the commissioner shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid, if written application to the commissioner for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied, the commissioner shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. The commissioner may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit made as herein provided shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to institute a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc if application to the supreme court be made therefor within four months after the giving of notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a taxpayer, that a final determination of tax due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a taxpayer unless an undertaking shall first be filed with the commissioner, in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the taxpayer will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section, of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2407 of this chapter where such person has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner made pursuant to section 11-2407 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or of the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-2409 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if such taxpayer institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2407 of this chapter.






*§ 11-2410 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the taxpayer has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to such taxpayer on his or her application for refund, the city comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-2411 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner, bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce payment of the same against the person liable for the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner in his or her discretion believes that a taxpayer subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which tax or penalties or interest might be satisfied and that any such tax or penalty or interest will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax or penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commission may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff, commanding such sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of such person which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall, within five days after the receipt of the warrant, file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner and with like effect as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but he or she shall be entitled to no fee for compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever there is made a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of a stock of merchandise or of fixtures, or merchandise and of fixtures pertaining to the conducting of the business of the seller, transferor or assignor, otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade and in the regular prosecution of said business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of such merchandise, fixtures, or merchandise and fixtures, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner as required by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid taxes, additions to tax, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

The provisions of section 11-2408 of this chapter shall be applicable to such refunds.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twentyfive percent in the aggregate. For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of tax shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the tax which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of tax required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

For the purpose of computing the addition for any month, the amount of tax stated in the notice and demand shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid before the beginning of such month.

   (4) Limitations on additions.

      (A) With respect to any return the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph two of this subdivision for any month to which an addition applies under both paragraphs one and two. In any case described in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the amount of the addition under such paragraph (1) shall not be reduced below the amount provided in such subparagraph.

      (B) With respect to any return, the maximum amount of the addition permitted under paragraph three of this subdivision shall be reduced by the amount of the addition under paragraph one of this subdivision (determined without regard to subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (1)) which is attributable to the tax for which the notice and demand is made and which is not paid within ten days of such notice and demand.

(c) Underpayment due to negligence.

   (3) The penalty under this subdivision shall be in lieu of any other addition to tax imposed by subdivision (b) or (c) of this section.

(e) Additional penalty.

*§ 11-2415 Returns to be secret.* ::


a. Except in accordance with proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner, the tax appeals tribunal or any officer or employee of the city to divulge or make known in any manner any information relating to the business of a taxpayer contained in any return required under this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the inspection by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city, or by the district attorney of any county within the city, or the return of any taxpayer who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action or proceeding under this chapter may be instituted. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner permits them to be destroyed.

(b) (1) Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office in this city for a period of five years thereafter.

   (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title.

(c) This section shall be deemed a state statute for purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of the public officers law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in subdivision a of this section to the contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for administrative review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to the tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.






*§ 11-2416 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by him or her, or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty or interest provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return, provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1) Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

Where a person occupies a room for less than a full day and pays less than the rent for a full day, the tax shall nevertheless be the same amount as would be due had such person occupied the room for a full day at the rent for a full day.

   (3) In addition to the tax imposed by paragraph two of this subdivision, there is hereby imposed and there shall be paid a tax for every occupancy of each room in a hotel in the city of New York (A) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room up to and including August thirty-first, nineteen hundred ninety, (B) at the rate of six percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after September first, nineteen hundred ninety and before December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four, (C) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December first, nineteen hundred ninety-four and before March first, two thousand nine, (D) at the rate of five and seven-eighths percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after March first, two thousand nine and before December first, two thousand thirteen, (E) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December first, two thousand thirteen and before December twentieth, two thousand thirteen, (F) at the rate of five and seven-eighths percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December twentieth, two thousand thirteen and before December first, two thousand twenty-three, and (G) at the rate of five percent of the rent or charge per day for each such room on and after December first, two thousand twenty-three.

   (4) (i)    When occupancy is provided, for a single consideration, with property, services, amusement charges, or any other items, the separate sale of which is not subject to tax under this chapter, the entire consideration shall be treated as rent subject to tax under paragraph one of this subdivision; provided, however, that where the amount of the rent for occupancy is stated separately from the price of such property, services, amusement charges or other items on any sales slip, invoice, receipt, or other statement given the occupant and such rent is reasonable in relation to the value of such property, services, amusement charges, or other items, only such separately stated rent will be subject to tax under this subdivision.

      (ii) In regard to the collection of tax on occupancies by remarketers, when occupancy is provided, for a single consideration, with property, services, amusement charges, or any other items, whether or not such other items are taxable, the rent portion of the consideration for such sale shall be computed as follows: the total consideration for the sale multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the consideration paid to the hotel for the occupancy and the denominator of which shall be the consideration paid to the hotel for the occupancy plus the consideration paid to the providers of the other items being sold, or by any other reasonable method pursuant to which the rent portion of consideration would be no less than the computation of rent portion of consideration under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Nothing herein shall be construed to subject to tax or exempt from tax any service or property or amusement charge or other items otherwise subject to tax or exempt from tax under this chapter.

   (5) A room remarketer shall be allowed a refund or credit against the taxes collected and required to be remitted pursuant to section 11-2505 of this chapter in the amount of the tax it paid to the operator of the hotel or another room remarketer under this subdivision. Provided, however, that in order to qualify for a refund or credit under this paragraph with respect to any quarterly period, as described in subdivision a of section 11-2504 of this chapter, the room remarketer must, with respect to such quarter, (i) be registered for hotel room occupancy tax purposes under section 11-2514 of this chapter, and (ii) collect the taxes imposed by paragraphs two and three of this subdivision. Subject to the conditions and limitations of this paragraph, the provisions of section 11-2507 of this chapter shall apply to refunds or credits under this paragraph.

   (6) Where the rent is paid or charged or billed, or falls due on either a weekly, monthly or other term basis, the daily rent upon which the tax is determined shall be the result obtained by dividing the rent for such term by the number of days in such term. Where the rent is for more than one room, including but not limited to a suite of rooms, the daily rent per room upon which tax is determined shall be calculated by multiplying the daily rent for the group of rooms by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the daily rent for the particular room, or a similar room, when such room is rented alone with similar bath facilities, and the denominator of which shall be the total of the daily rent for the individual rooms in the group of rooms, or similar rooms, when such rooms are rented alone with similar bath facilities. In any case in which it is not possible to determine the daily rent per room in the foregoing manner, the commissioner of finance shall prescribe methods for making such determination.

b. (1)    No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon a permanent resident.

   (2) For purposes of this subdivision, an occupant who is eligible to request and has requested a lease pursuant to the provisions of paragraph two of subdivision (a) of section 2522.5 of the rent stabilization regulations promulgated by the division of housing and community renewal of the state of New York (title nine, subtitle S, chapter VIII of the official compilation of codes, rules and regulations of the state of New York), shall tentatively be accorded the status of permanent resident as of the date of such request, notwithstanding that such occupant has not met the one hundred eighty-consecutive-day requirement contained in subdivision eight of section 11-2501 of this chapter as of such date. In the case of such an occupant, the operator or room remarketer shall not collect the taxes imposed by this chapter for any day, commencing with the date such lease is requested, which falls within a period of continuous occupancy by such occupant of a room or rooms in the hotel. Provided, however, if such occupant ceases to occupy a room or rooms in the hotel prior to the completion of one hundred eighty consecutive days of occupancy, any taxes not collected theretofore by reason of the provisions of this paragraph shall become immediately due and payable on the date of cessation of occupancy and shall be collected by the operator or room remarketer from such occupant. In the event, however, that the operator or room remarketer is unable to collect such taxes from the occupant, the operator or room remarketer shall not be liable to the city for such taxes. The provisions of this paragraph shall apply with respect to leases requested on or after September first, nineteen hundred ninety.

c. No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon any organization described in subdivision (a) of section eleven hundred sixteen of the tax law to the extent such organization is not subject to the tax imposed under subdivision (e) of section eleven hundred five of the tax law.

d. (1)    No tax shall be imposed hereunder upon any person occupying any room or rooms in a hotel solely and directly as a result of such person's involuntary displacement from premises by the attack on the World Trade Center on September eleventh, two thousand one, provided such premises were not subject to the tax imposed by this section or the tax imposed under section eleven hundred seven of the tax law.

   (2) Where an occupant claims exemption from the tax under the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, the rent shall be deemed taxable hereunder unless the operator shall receive from the occupant claiming such exemption a signed written statement describing the specific circumstances providing the basis for such claim and containing such other information as the commissioner of finance may require. The operator shall retain such statement and provide it to the commissioner of finance upon request.

e. Where any corporation, or association, or trust, or community chest, fund or foundation, organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals, and no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual and no substantial part of the activities of which is carrying on propaganda, or otherwise attempting to influence legislation, carries on its activities in furtherance of any of the purposes for which it was organized, in premises in which, as part of said activities, it operates a hotel, occupancy of rooms in said premises and rents therefrom received by such corporation or association shall not be subject to tax hereunder. Nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to include an organization operated for the primary purpose of carrying on a trade or business for profit, whether or not all of its profits are payable to one or more organizations described in this subdivision.

f. The tax to be collected shall be stated separately from the rent on a sales slip, invoice, receipt, or other statement of the price ("invoice") given to the occupant prior to the occupant's completion of his or her occupancy and be verifiable from the books and records of an operator or room remarketer responsible for collecting and remitting the tax.

   (1) Where an occupant rents a room directly from an operator, the tax shall be paid by the occupant to the operator as trustee for and on account of the city, and the operator shall be liable for the collection of the tax on the rent and for the payment of the tax on the rent.

   (2) The operator or room remarketer and any officer of any corporate operator or room remarketer shall be personally liable for the portion of the tax collected or required to be collected under this chapter, and the operator shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from the occupant, or in respect to nonpayment of the tax by the occupant as if the tax were a part of the rent for the occupancy payable at the time such tax shall become due and owing, including all rights of eviction, dispossession, repossession and enforcement of any innkeeper's lien that he or she may have in the event of nonpayment of rent by the occupant; provided however, that the commissioner of finance shall be joined as a party in any action or proceeding brought by the operator to collect or enforce collection of the tax.

g. Where the occupant has failed to pay and the operator or room marketer has failed to collect a tax as imposed by this chapter, then in addition to all other rights, obligations and remedies provided, such tax shall be payable by the occupant directly to the commissioner of finance, and it shall be the duty of the occupant to file a return thereof with the commissioner of finance and to pay the tax imposed therein to the commissioner of finance within fifteen days after such tax was due.

h. The commissioner of finance may, wherever he or she deems it necessary for the proper enforcement of this chapter, provide by regulation that the occupant shall file returns and pay directly to the commissioner of finance the tax herein imposed, at such times as returns are required to be filed and payment over made by the operator or room remarketer.

i. The tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid upon any occupancy on and after July first, nineteen hundred seventy, although such occupancy is had pursuant to a contract, lease or other arrangement made prior to such effective date. Where rent is paid, or charged or billed, or falls due on either a weekly, monthly, or other term basis, the rent so paid, charged, billed or falling due shall be subject to the tax herein imposed to the extent that it covers any portion of the period on and after July first, nineteen hundred seventy, and such payment, bill, charge or rent due shall be apportioned on the basis of the ratio of the number of days falling within said period, to the total number of days covered thereby. Where any tax has been paid hereunder upon any rent which has been ascertained to be worthless, the commissioner of finance may by regulation provide for credit and/or refund of the amount of such tax upon application therefor as provided in section 11-2507 of this chapter.

j. For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter and to prevent evasion of the tax hereby imposed, it shall be presumed that all rents are subject to tax until the contrary is established, and the burden of proving that a rent for occupancy is not taxable hereunder shall be upon the operator, the room remarketer, or the occupant. Where an occupant claims exemption from the tax under the provisions of subdivision c of this section, the rent shall be deemed taxable hereunder unless the operator or room remarketer shall receive from the occupant claiming such exemption a copy of the exempt organization certificate that is necessary to obtain exemption from the tax imposed under subdivision (e) of section eleven hundred five of the tax law, together with a certificate duly executed by the organization named in such certificate certifying that the occupant is its agent, representative or employee and that his or her occupancy is paid or to be paid by, and is necessary or required in the course of or in connection with the affairs of said organization.

k. No operator or room remarketer shall advertise or hold out to the public in any manner, directly or indirectly, that the tax imposed by this chapter is not considered as a mandatory addition to the rent charged to the occupant.

l. An occupancy that an operator conveys or furnishes to a room remarketer that the room remarketer intends to convey or furnish, directly or indirectly, to an occupant for rent shall be exempt from the taxes imposed by this section, provided that such room remarketer furnishes the operator with a certificate in such form and containing such information as may be prescribed by the commissioner of finance. The operator shall retain such statement and provide it to the commissioner of finance upon request.








*§ 11-2503 Records to be kept.* ::


a. Every operator and every room remarketer shall keep records of every occupancy and of all rent paid, charged or due thereon and of the tax payable thereon, in such form as the commissioner of finance may by regulation require. Such records shall be available for inspection and examination at any time upon demand by the commissioner of finance or his or her duly authorized agent or employee and shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the commissioner of finance may consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be kept longer.

b.    Notwithstanding the provisions of section three hundred five and three hundred nine of the state technology law or any other law, the commissioner may require any person who has elected to maintain in an electronic format any portion of the records required to be maintained by that person under this chapter, to make the electronic records available and accessible to the commissioner, notwithstanding that the records are also maintained in a hard copy format.






*§ 11-2504 Returns.* ::


a. Every operator and every room remarketer shall file with the commissioner of finance a return of occupancy and of rents, and of the taxes payable thereon, for the quarterly periods ending on the last day of February, May, August and November of each year. Such returns shall be filed within twenty days after the end of the quarterly period covered thereby. The commissioner of finance may permit or require returns to be made by other periods and upon such dates as he or she may specify. If the commissioner of finance deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax imposed by this chapter, he or she may require returns to be made for shorter periods than those prescribed pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this subdivision and upon such dates as he or she may specify.

b. The forms of returns shall be prescribed by the commissioner of finance and shall contain such information as he or she may deem necessary for the proper administration of this chapter. The commissioner of finance may require amended returns to be filed within twenty days after notice and to contain the information specified in the notice.

c. If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient on its face the commissioner of finance shall take the necessary steps to enforce the filing of such a return or a corrected return.






*§ 11-2505 Payment of tax.* ::


At the time of filing a return of occupancy and of rents each operator and room remarketer shall pay to the commissioner of finance the taxes imposed by this chapter upon the rents required to be included in such return, as well as all other moneys collected by the operator or room remarketer acting or purporting to act under the provisions of this chapter, even though it be judicially determined that the tax collected is invalidly imposed. All the taxes for the period for which a return is required to be filed shall be due from the operator or room remarketer and payable to the commissioner of finance on the date limited for the filing of the return for such period, without regard to whether a return is filed or whether the return which is filed correctly shows the amount of rents and the taxes due thereon. Where the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion deems it necessary to protect revenues to be obtained under this chapter he or she may require any operator or room remarketer required to collect the tax imposed by this chapter to file with him or her a bond, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as the commissioner of finance may fix, to secure the payment of any tax and/or penalties and interest due or which may become due from such operator or room remarketer. In the event that the commissioner of finance determines that an operator or room remarketer is to file such bond he or she shall give notice to such operator or room remarketer to that effect specifying the amount of the bond required. The operator or room remarketer shall file such bond within five days after the giving of such notice unless within such five days the operator or room remarketer shall request in writing a hearing before the commissioner of finance at which the necessity, propriety and amount of the bond shall be determined by the commissioner of finance. Such determination shall be final and shall be complied with within fifteen days after the giving of notice thereof. In lieu of such bond, securities approved by the commissioner of finance or cash in such amount as he or she may prescribe, may be deposited which shall be kept in the custody of the commissioner of finance who may at any time without notice to the depositor apply them to any tax and/or interest or penalties due, and for that purpose the securities may be sold by him or her at public or private sale without notice to the depositor thereof.






*§ 11-2506 Determination of tax.* ::


If a return required by this chapter is not filed, or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of tax due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the tax may be estimated on the basis of external indices, such as number of rooms, location, scale of rents, comparable rents, type of accommodations and service, number of employees and/or other factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the collection and/or payment of the tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the person against whom it is assessed, within ninety days after giving of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the code and the taxpayer has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing, or unless the commissioner of finance of his or her own motion shall redetermine the same. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the tax is assessed. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the tax was assessed, within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless: (a) the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this state and approved by the superintendent of insurance of this state as to solvency and responsibility, in such amount as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or (b) at the option of such person such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against it in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event such person shall not be required to deposit such taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-2507 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any tax, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if written application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund or credit is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reasons therefor and give notice thereof to the taxpayer in writing. Such application may be made by the occupant, operator, room remarketer or other person who has actually paid the tax to the commissioner of finance. Such application may also be made by an operator or room remarketer who has collected and paid over such tax to the commissioner of finance provided that the application is made within one year of the payment by the occupant to the operator or room remarketer, but no actual refund of moneys shall be made to such operator or room remarketer until he or she shall first establish to the satisfaction of the commissioner of finance, under such regulations as the commissioner of finance may prescribe, that he or she has repaid to the occupant the amount for which the application for refund is made. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance, has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any tax, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review such decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a person liable for the tax, that a final determination of tax was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a person liable for the tax unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a tax, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2506 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of a tax, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-2506 of this chapter unless it be found that such determinatiion was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or of the commissioner of finance's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provision of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the tax, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-2508 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the occupant, operator or room remarketer has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to such occupant, operator or room remarketer on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-2509 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-2506 and 11-2507 of this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of tax liability imposed by this chapter; and no determination or proposed determination of tax or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, and action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a taxpayer may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2506 of this chapter.






*§ 11-2510 Proceedings to recover tax.* ::


a. Whenever any operator or room remarketer, or any officer of a corporate operator or room remarketer, or any occupant or other person shall fail to collect and pay over any tax and/or to pay any tax, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as therein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring or cause to be brought an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States. If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such operator, or room remarketer, officer, occupant or other person is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax, penalties or interest might be satisfied, and that any such tax, penalty or interest will not be paid when due, he or she may declare such tax, penalty or interest to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately.

b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the operator or room remarketer or officer of a corporate operator or room remarketer or of the occupant or other person liable for the tax, which may be found within the city for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalties and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant, in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record, and for services in executing the warrant such sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to any officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. Whenever an operator shall make a sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of any part or the whole of such operator's hotel or of his or her lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such hotel, or of the equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies or stock of merchandise, or of the said premises or lease, license or other agreement or right to possess or operate such hotel and the equipment, furnishings, fixtures, supplies and stock of merchandise pertaining to the conduct or operation of said hotel, other- wise than in the ordinary and regular prosecution of business, the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall at least ten days before taking possession of the subject of said sale, transfer or assignment, or paying therefor, notify the commissioner of finance by registered mail of the proposed sale and of the price, terms and conditions thereof whether or not the seller, transferor or assignor, has represented to, or informed the purchaser, transferee or assignee that it owes any tax pursuant to this chapter, and whether or not the purchaser, transferee or assignee has knowledge that such taxes are owing, and whether any such taxes are in fact owing. Whenever the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall fail to give notice to the commissioner of finance as required by the preceding paragraph, or whenever the commissioner of finance shall inform the purchaser, transferee or assignee that a possible claim for such tax or taxes exists, any sums of money, property or choses in action, or other consideration, which the purchaser, transferee or assignee is required to transfer over to the seller, transferor or assignor shall be subject to a first priority right and lien for any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferor or assignor to the city, and the purchaser, transferee or assignee is forbidden to transfer to the seller, transferor or assignor any such sums of money, property or choses in action to the extent of the amount of the city's claim. For failure to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, the purchaser, transferee or assignee, in addition to being subject to the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article six of the uniform commercial code, shall be personally liable for the payment to the city of any such taxes theretofore or thereafter determined to be due to the city from the seller, transferor or assignor, and such liability may be assessed and enforced in the same manner as the liability for tax under this chapter.

d.

   (2) Failure to pay tax shown on return. In case of failure to pay the amount shown as tax on a return required to be filed under this chapter on or before the prescribed date (determined with regard to any extension of time for payment), unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, there shall be added to the amount shown as tax on such return one-half of one percent of the amount of such tax if the failure is not for more than one month, with an additional one-half of one percent for each additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues, not exceeding twenty-five percent in the aggregate.

The commissioner of finance shall have the power, in his or her discretion, to waive, reduce or compromise any penalty under this subdivision.

(f) The interest and penalties imposed by this section shall be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. Unpaid interest and penalties may be enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter.

(g) (1)    Authority to set interest rates. The commissioner of finance shall set the rate of interest to be paid pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, but if no such rate of interest is set, such rate shall be deemed to be set at seven and one-half percent per annum. Such rate shall be the rate prescribed in paragraph two of this subdivision but shall not be less than seven and one-half percent per annum. Any such rate set by the commissioner of finance shall apply to taxes, or any portion thereof, which remain or become due on or after the date on which such rate becomes effective and shall apply only with respect to interest computed or computable for periods or portions of periods occurring in the period in which such rate is in effect.

   (2) General rule. The rate of interest set under this subdivision shall be the sum of (i) the federal short-term rate as provided under paragraph three of this subdivision, plus (ii) seven percentage points.

   (3) Federal short-term rate. For purposes of this subdivision:

      (A) The federal short-term rate for any month shall be the federal short-term rate determined by the United States secretary of the treasury during such month in accordance with subsection (d) of section twelve hundred seventy-four of the internal revenue code for use in connection with section six thousand six hundred twenty-one of the internal revenue code. Any such rate shall be rounded to the nearest full percent (or, if a multiple of one-half of one percent, such rate shall be increased to the next highest full percent).

      (B) Period during which rate applies.

         (i) In general. Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the federal short-term rate for the first month in each calendar quarter shall apply during the first calendar quarter beginning after such month.

         (ii) Special rule for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine. The federal short-term rate for the month of April, nineteen hundred eighty-nine shall apply with respect to setting the rate of interest for the month of September, nineteen hundred eighty-nine.

   (4) Publication of interest rate. The commissioner of finance shall cause to be published in the city record, and give other appropriate general notice of, the interest rate to be set under this subdivision no later than twenty days preceding the first day of the calendar quarter during which such interest rate applies. The setting and publication of such interest rate shall not be included within paragraph (a) of subdivision five of section one thousand forty-one of the city charter relating to the definition of a rule.

(h) Miscellaneous. 

   (1) Officers of a corporate operator or room remarketer and partners in a partnership which is an operator or room remarketer shall be personally liable for the tax collected or required to be collected by such corporation or partnership under this chapter, and subject to the penalties and interest imposed by this section.

   (2) The certificate of the commissioner of finance to the effect that a tax has not been paid, that a return, bond or registration certificate has not been filed, or that information has not been supplied pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be presumptive evidence thereof.

   (3) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title.

(i) Any person required to make or maintain records under this chapter who fails to make or maintain or make available to the commissioner these records is subject to a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for the first quarterly period or part thereof for which the failure occurs and not to exceed five thousand dollars for each additional quarterly period or part thereof for which the failure occurs. This penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided for in this chapter but may not be imposed and collected more than once for failures for the same quarterly period or part thereof. If the commissioner determines that a failure to make or maintain or make available records in any quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the commissioner must remit the penalty imposed for that quarterly period. These penalties will be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. These penalties will be determined, assessed, collected, paid and enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter, and all the provisions of this chapter relating to tax will be deemed also to apply to the penalties imposed by this subdivision. For purposes of the penalty imposed by this subdivision, a person will be considered to have failed to make or maintain the required records when the commissioner of finance determines that the records made or maintained by that person for a quarterly period do not enable the commissioner to verify occupancy or the amounts received for such occupancy or the taxability of that occupancy and to conduct a complete audit.

(j) Any person required to make or maintain records under this chapter who fails to present and make available these records in an auditable form is subject to a penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each quarterly period or part thereof for which records maintained by that person are not presented and made available by that person in auditable form, even if these records are adequate to verify credits, receipts, and the taxability thereof and to perform a complete audit. This penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided for in this chapter, but will not be imposed and collected more than once for these failures for the same quarterly period or part thereof. If the commissioner determines that any failure described in this subdivision for a quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the commissioner must remit the penalty imposed for that quarter. The penalties imposed by this subdivision will be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. These penalties will be determined, assessed, collected, paid and enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter, and all the provisions of this chapter relating to tax will be deemed also to apply to the penalties imposed by this subdivision. For purposes of the penalty imposed by this subdivision, a person will be considered to have failed to present and make records available in auditable form when the records presented by that person for that quarter lack sufficient organization, such as by date, invoice number, sales receipts, or sequential numbering, or are otherwise inadequate (without reorganizing, reordering or otherwise rearranging the records into an auditable form) to permit direct reconciliation of the receipts, invoices or other source documents with the entries for the quarterly period in the books and records and on the returns of that person.

(k) Any person who, having elected to maintain in an electronic format any portion or all of the records he or she is required to make and maintain by this chapter, fails to present and make these records available and accessible to the commissioner in electronic format, is subject to a penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars for each quarterly period or part thereof for which these electronic records are not presented and made available and accessible upon request, notwithstanding that the records may also be maintained and available in hard copy format. This penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided for in this chapter, but may not be imposed and collected more than once for a failure for the same quarterly period or part thereof. Provided, however, nothing in this subdivision will prevent the separate imposition, if applicable, of any penalty imposed by subdivision (i) or (j) of this section for the same quarterly period or part thereof. If the commissioner determines that the failure to present and make electronically maintained records available and accessible for a quarterly period was entirely due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, the commissioner must remit the penalty imposed for that quarter. These penalties will be paid and disposed of in the same manner as other revenues from this chapter. These penalties will be determined, assessed, collected, paid and enforced in the same manner as the tax imposed by this chapter, and all the provisions of this chapter relating to tax will be deemed also to apply to the penalty imposed by this subdivision. For purposes of the penalty imposed by this subdivision, a failure to present and make available and accessible a record maintained in electronic format includes not only the denial of access to the requested records that were maintained electronically, but also the failure to make available to the commissioner the information, knowledge, or means necessary to access and otherwise use the electronically maintained records in the inspection and examination of these records.

(l) Aiding or assisting in the giving of fraudulent returns, reports, statements or other documents. Any person who, with the intent that tax be evaded, for a fee or other compensation or as an incident to the performance of other services for which that person receives compensation, aids or assists in, or procures, counsels, or advises the preparation or presentation under this chapter, or in connection with any matter arising under this chapter, of any return, report, declaration, statement or other document that is fraudulent or false as to any material matter, or supplies any false or fraudulent information, whether or not such falsity or fraud is with the knowledge or consent of the person authorized or required to present that return, report, declaration, statement or other document, will pay a penalty not exceeding five thousand dollars. The definitions in subsection (l) of section one thousand eighty-five of the tax law apply for the purposes of this penalty.

(m) False or fraudulent document penalty. Any taxpayer that submits a false or fraudulent document to the department will be subject to a penalty of one hundred dollars per document submitted, or five hundred dollars per tax return submitted. This penalty will be in addition to any other penalty provided by law.

Except in accordance with proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the commissioner of finance, any officer or employee of the department of finance, any person engaged or retained on an independent contract basis, the tax appeals tribunal, any commissioner or employee of such tribunal, or any person who, pursuant to this section, is permitted to inspect any return or to whom a copy, an abstract or a portion of any return is furnished, or to whom any information contained in any return is furnished, to divulge or make known in any manner the rents or other information relating to the business of a taxpayer contained in any return required under this chapter. The officers charged with the custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court, except on behalf of the commissioner of finance in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this chapter when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to the action or proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a taxpayer or his or her duly authorized representative of a certified copy of any return filed in connection with his or her tax; nor to prohibit the delivery of such a certified copy of such return or of any information contained in or relating thereto, to the United States of America or any department thereof, to the state of New York or any department thereof, or to any agency or department of the city of New York, provided the same is requested for official business; nor to prohibit the inspection for official business of such returns by the corporation counsel or other legal representatives of the city or by the district attorney of any county within the city; nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof. Returns shall be preserved for three years and thereafter until the commissioner of finance permits them to be destroyed.

b. (1)    Any officer or employee of the city who willfully violates the provisions of subdivision a of this section shall be dismissed from office and be incapable of holding any public office for a period of five years thereafter.

   (2) Cross-reference: For criminal penalties, see chapter forty of this title.

c. This section shall be deemed a state statute for purposes of paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section eighty-seven of the public officers law.

d. Notwithstanding anything in subdivision a of this section to the contrary, if a taxpayer has petitioned the tax appeals tribunal for administrative review as provided in section one hundred seventy of the charter, the commissioner of finance shall be authorized to present to the tribunal any report or return of such taxpayer, or any information contained therein or relating thereto, which may be material or relevant to the proceeding before the tribunal. The tax appeals tribunal shall be authorized to publish a copy or a summary of any decision rendered pursuant to section one hundred seventy-one of the charter.






*§ 11-2517 Notices and limitations of time.* ::


a. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the last return filed by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by him or her or, if no return has been filed or application made, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.

b. The provisions of the civil practice law and rules or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement of a civil remedy shall not apply to any proceeding or action taken by the city to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the collection of any tax or penalty provided by this chapter. However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law the tax may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional tax, a taxpayer has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional tax due may be determined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may be further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the expiration of the extended period.

d. If any return, claim, statement, notice, application, or other document required to be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date under authority of any provision of this chapter is, after such period or such date, delivered by United States mail to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom such document is required to be filed, or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made, the date of the United States postmark stamped on the envelope shall be deemed to be the date of delivery. This subdivision shall apply only if the postmark date falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for the filing of such document, or for making the payment, including any extension granted for such filing or payment, and only if such document or payment was deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, properly addressed to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person with which or with whom the document is required to be filed or to which or to whom such payment is required to be made. If any document is sent by United States registered mail, such registration shall be prima facie evidence that such document was delivered to the commissioner of finance, the tax appeals tribunal, bureau, office, officer or person to which or to whom addressed, and the date of registration shall be deemed the postmark date. The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail. Except as provided in subdivision f of this section, this subdivision shall apply in the case of postmarks not made by the United States postal service only if and to the extent provided by regulation of the commissioner of finance or, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal.

e. When the last day prescribed under authority of this chapter (including any extension of time) for performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in the state, the performance of such act shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

f. (1)    Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the secretary of the treasury of the United States pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a designated delivery service. If the commissioner of finance finds that any delivery service designated by such secretary is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. The commissioner of finance may also designate additional delivery services meeting the criteria of section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code for purposes of this title, or may withdraw any such designation if the commissioner of finance finds that a delivery service so designated is inadequate for the needs of the city. Any reference in subdivision d of this section to the United States mail shall be treated as including a reference to any delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance and any reference in subdivision d of this section to a United States postmark shall be treated as including a reference to any date recorded or marked in the manner described in section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code by a delivery service designated by the commissioner of finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

   (2) Any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by the United States secretary of the treasury, or as may be designated by the commissioner of finance pursuant to the same criteria used by such secretary for such designations pursuant to section seventy-five hundred two of the internal revenue code, shall be included within the meaning of registered or certified mail as used in subdivision d of this section. If the commissioner of finance finds that any equivalent of registered or certified mail designated by such secretary or the commissioner of finance is inadequate for the needs of the city, the commissioner of finance may withdraw such designation for purposes of this title. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any withdrawal of designation or additional designation by the commissioner of finance shall not be effective for purposes of service upon the tax appeals tribunal, unless and until such withdrawal of designation or additional designation is ratified by the president of the tax appeals tribunal.

Seven-eighths of the moneys in such fund shall be made available to the New York Convention and Visitor's Bureau, Inc. pursuant to an annual contract with the city which may specify, among other things, the services which shall be provided by such bureau with such moneys and the content and number of reports which will have to be provided by such bureau to the city concerning the expenditure of such moneys, and provided that the annual budget and business plan of such bureau is approved by the mayor of the city or his or her designee. The remaining one-eighth of the fund shall be spent for promoting tourism and conventions which may include, at the mayor's discretion, moneys spent in connection with additional contracts made with the New York Convention and Visitor's Bureau, Inc.

With respect to: (1) real property securing a principal debt or obligation of less than five hundred thousand dollars, a tax of one dollar, (2) with respect to one, two or three-family houses and individual residential condominium units securing a principal debt or obligation of five hundred thousand dollars or more, a tax of one dollar and twelve and one-half cents, and (3) with respect to all other real property, a tax of one dollar and seventy-five cents, for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction thereof of principal debt or obligation which is, or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at any time thereafter by a mortgage on such real property situated within the city and recorded on or after August first, nineteen hundred ninety, is hereby imposed on each such mortgage and shall be collected and paid as provided in this chapter. If the principal debt or obligation which is or by any contingency may be secured by such mortgage is less than one hundred dollars, a tax of one dollar is hereby imposed on such mortgage and shall be collected and paid as provided in this chapter.

e. (1) For the purpose of determining whether a mortgage is subject to the tax imposed by subdivision b or c of this section at a rate in excess of fifty cents, or by subdivision d of this section at a rate in excess of one dollar, for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction thereof of principal debt or obligation, the principal debt or obligation which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at any time thereafter, by such mortgage shall be aggregated with the principal debt or obligation which is or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof, or at any time thereafter, by any other mortgage, where such mortgages form part of the same or related transactions and have the same or related mortgagors. If the commissioner of taxation and finance finds that a mortgage transaction or mortgage transactions have been formulated for the purpose of avoiding or evading a rate of tax imposed under this section in excess of the lowest such rate, rather than solely for an independent business or financial purpose, such commissioner shall treat all of the mortgages forming part of such transaction or transactions as a single mortgage for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of tax. For the purposes of this subdivision, all mortgages having the same or related mortgagors offered for recording within a period of twelve consecutive months shall be presumed to form part of a related transaction, unless clear and convincing evidence is offered to the contrary. The commissioner of taxation and finance may require such affidavits and forms, and may prescribe such rules and regulations, as he determines to be necessary to enforce the provisions of this subdivision.

   (2) The term "related", when used in this subdivision with reference to mortgagors, shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following relationships:

      (i) members of a family, including spouses, ancestors, lineal descendants, and brothers and sisters (whether by the whole or half blood);

      (ii) a shareholder and a corporation more than fifty percent of the value of the outstanding stock of which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such shareholder;

      (iii) a partner and a partnership more than fifty percent of the capital or profits interest in which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such partner;

      (iv) a beneficiary and a trust more than fifty percent of the beneficial interest in which is owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such beneficiary;

      (v) two or more corporations, partnerships, associations, or trusts, or any combination thereof, which are owned or controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the same person, corporation or other entity, or interests; and

      (vi) a grantor of a trust and such trust.

f. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in paragraph (a) of subdivision one of section two hundred fifty-five of the tax law, the taxes imposed by subdivision c or d of this section shall also apply to principal indebtedness or obligation secured by or which under any contingency may be secured by a supplemental instrument or additional mortgage, whether or not there is any new or further indebtedness or obligation other than the principal indebtedness or obligation secured by a recorded primary mortgage, where (1) the supplemental instrument or additional mortgage imposes the lien of a recorded mortgage upon real property situated within the city not previously subject to the mortgage or where an additional mortgage upon such additional property is recorded as additional or substitute security for indebtness or obligation already secured by a recorded mortgage and (2) the recorded primary mortgage was on real property outside the city and recorded without payment of the city tax.

It shall be the duty of such recording officer to indorse upon each mortgage a receipt for the amount of the tax so paid.

Upon the first day of each month the city register and the recording officer of Richmond county shall pay over to the commissioner of finance of the city for credit to the general fund of such city, the balance of the moneys received during the preceding month upon account of taxes paid to him or her as herein prescribed, after deducting the necessary expenses of his or her office as provided in section two hundred sixty-two of the tax law, except taxes paid upon mortgages which are first to be apportioned by the commissioner of taxation and finance, which taxes and money shall be paid over by him or her as provided by the determination of the said commissioner of taxation and finance. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, in each instance where the tax imposed pursuant to section 11-2601 of this chapter is one dollar and twenty-five cents for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction thereof of such principal debt or obligation, fifty percent of the total amount of such tax, including fifty percent of any interest or penalties thereon, shall be set aside in a special account by the commissioner of finance, and in each instance where the tax imposed pursuant to that section is one dollar and seventy-five cents for each one hundred dollars and each remaining major fraction thereof of such principal debt or obligation, thirty-five and seven-tenths percent of the total amount of such tax, including thirty-five and seven-tenths percent of any interest or penalties thereon, shall also be set aside in such special account.

For purposes of this chapter any reference in article eleven of the tax law to the tax or taxes imposed by such article shall be deemed to refer to a tax imposed by this chapter, and any reference to the phrase "within this state" shall be read as "within this city" unless a different meaning is clearly required. Whenever real property covered by the mortgage is partly within and partly without the city of New York, the portion of the mortgage taxable under this chapter shall be determined in the manner prescribed in the first paragraph of section two hundred sixty of the tax law where the property without the city is located within the state and, in the manner prescribed in the second paragraph of such section of the tax law, where the property without the city is located without the state.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the failure of the commissioner to mail such return form and instructions nor the failure of any person to receive the same shall relieve any person of the obligation to file any return required under this section or of liability for the charge, interest or penalties imposed by this chapter.

d. If no form or other notice has previously been sent to a person subject to the annual vault charge with respect to the amount of vault charge owed for any year, the commissioner of finance shall notify such person of the amount owed as soon as practicable after discovering that such amount is owed.

In cases where no license of record has been issued for a vault or where the depth of a vault exceeds twelve feet, the burden of proving the actual size of the vault shall be upon the person liable for the vault charge.






*§ 11-2707 Determination of vault charge.* ::


If a return required by this chapter is not filed or if a return when filed is incorrect or insufficient, the amount of the vault charge due shall be determined by the commissioner of finance from such information as may be obtainable and, if necessary, the charge may be estimated on the basis of external indices, including but not limited to the records of the department of transportation, the reports of tax assessors, the reports of inspectors and investigators in the offices of the commissioner of finance and commissioner of transportation, and/or other information or factors. Notice of such determination shall be given to the person liable for the payment thereof.

Upon such hearing the tax appeals tribunal may require the filing of a certificate signed by a city surveyor specifying the dimensions of the vault. After such hearing the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the person against whom the vault charge is assessed. A decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules if application therefor is made to the supreme court by the person against whom the vault charge was assessed within four months after the giving of the notice of such tax appeals tribunal decision. A proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules shall not be instituted by a person against whom the vault charge is assessed unless (a) the amount of any vault charge sought to be reviewed, with penalties and interest thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the commissioner of finance and there shall be filed with the commissioner of finance an undertaking in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the vault charge confirmed the person against whom the vault charge is assessed will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding, or (b) at the option of such person, such undertaking filed with the commissioner of finance may be in a sum sufficient to cover the vault charge, penalties and interest thereon stated in such decision plus the costs and charges which may accrue against him or her in the prosecution of the proceeding, in which event such person shall not be required to deposit such vault charge, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the application.






*§ 11-2708 Refunds.* ::


a. In the manner provided in this section, the commissioner of finance shall refund or credit, without interest, any vault charge, penalty or interest erroneously, illegally or unconstitutionally collected or paid if application to the commissioner of finance for such refund shall be made within one year from the payment thereof. Whenever a refund is made or denied by the commissioner of finance, he or she shall state his or her reason therefor and give notice thereof to the applicant in writing. Such application may be made by the owner of the premises, or other person, who has actually paid the vault charge. The commissioner of finance may, in lieu of any refund required to be made, allow credit therefor on payments due from the applicant.

b. Any determination of the commissioner of finance denying a refund or credit pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be final and irrevocable unless the applicant for such refund or credit, within ninety days from the mailing of notice of such determination, or, if the commissioner of finance has established a conciliation procedure pursuant to section 11-124 of the administrative code and the applicant has requested a conciliation conference in accordance therewith, within ninety days from the mailing of a conciliation decision or the date of the commissioner's confirmation of the discontinuance of the conciliation proceeding, both (1) serves a petition upon the commissioner of finance and (2) files a petition with the tax appeals tribunal for a hearing. Such petition for a refund or credit, made as herein provided, shall be deemed an application for a revision of any vault charge, penalty or interest complained of. Such hearing and any appeal to the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc from the decision rendered in such hearing shall be conducted in the manner and subject to the requirements prescribed by the tax appeals tribunal pursuant to sections one hundred sixty-eight through one hundred seventy-two of the charter. After such hearing, the tax appeals tribunal shall give notice of its decision to the applicant and to the commissioner of finance. The applicant shall be entitled to review such decision of the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc by a proceeding pursuant to article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, provided such proceeding is instituted within four months after the giving of the notice of such decision, and provided, in the case of an application by a person against whom the vault charge is assessed, that a final determination of the vault charge due was not previously made. Such a proceeding shall not be instituted by a person against whom the vault charge is assessed unless an undertaking is filed with the commissioner of finance in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the supreme court shall approve to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the vault charge confirmed, such person will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding.

c. A person shall not be entitled to a revision, refund or credit under this section of a vault charge, interest or penalty which had been determined to be due pursuant to the provisions of section 11-2707 of this chapter where he or she has had a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing, as provided in said section, or has failed to avail himself or herself of the remedies therein provided. No refund or credit shall be made of annual vault charge, interest or penalty paid after a determination by the commissioner of finance made pursuant to section 11-2707 of this chapter unless it be found that such determination was erroneous, illegal or unconstitutional or otherwise improper, by the tax appeals tribunal after a hearing or on the commissioner's own motion, or, if such tax appeals tribunal affirms in whole or in part the determination of the commissioner of finance, in a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules, pursuant to the provisions of said section, in which event refund or credit without interest shall be made of the vault charge, interest or penalty found to have been overpaid.






*§ 11-2709 Reserves.* ::


In cases where the person or persons liable for the vault charge imposed by this chapter has applied for a refund and has instituted a proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules to review a determination adverse to him or her on his or her application for refund, the comptroller shall set up appropriate reserves to meet any decision adverse to the city.






*§ 11-2710 Remedies exclusive.* ::


The remedies provided by sections 11-2707 and 11-2708 of this chapter shall be the exclusive remedies available to any person for the review of the liability imposed hereunder, and no determination or proposed determination of an annual vault charge or determination on any application for refund by the commissioner of finance, nor any decision by the tax appeals tribunal or any of its administrative law judges, shall be enjoined or reviewed by an action for declaratory judgment, an action for money had and received or by any action or proceeding other than, in the case of a decision by the tax appeals tribunal sitting en banc, a proceeding in the nature of a certiorari proceeding under article seventy-eight of the civil practice law and rules; provided, however, that a person liable for the annual vault charge may proceed by declaratory judgment if he or she institutes suit within thirty days after a deficiency assessment is made and pays the amount of the deficiency assessment to the commissioner of finance prior to the institution of such suit and posts a bond for costs as provided in section 11-2707 of this chapter.






*§ 11-2711 Proceedings to recover annual vault charge.* ::


a. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any vault charge, penalty or interest imposed by this chapter as herein provided, the corporation counsel shall, upon the request of the commissioner of finance bring, or cause to be brought, an action to enforce the payment of the same on behalf of the city of New York in any court of the state of New York or of any other state or of the United States.

b. As an additional remedy or as an alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff, commanding him or her to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the person liable for vault charges which may be found within the city for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalties and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to him or her the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the vault charge, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrant he or she shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.

c. In addition to any other lien provided for in this section, the annual vault charge imposed by this chapter shall become a lien, binding upon the premises immediately adjoining such vault, on the date such charge is required to be paid until the same is paid in full.

d. The commissioner of finance, if he or she finds that the interests of the city will not thereby be jeopardized, and upon such conditions as the commissioner of finance may require, may release any property from the lien of any warrant or vacate such warrant for unpaid vault charges, additions to vault charges, penalties and interest filed pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such release or vacating of the warrant may be recorded in the office of any recording officer in which such warrant has been filed. The clerk shall thereupon cancel and discharge as of the original date of docketing the vacated warrant.

For the purpose of computing the addition for any month the amount of vault charge shown on the return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the charge which is paid on or before the beginning of such month and by the amount of any credit against the charge which may be claimed upon the return. If the amount of vault charge required to be shown on a return is less than the amount shown as such charge on such return, this paragraph shall be applied by substituting such lower amount.

Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this chapter may be given to the person for whom it is intended by mailing it in a postpaid envelope addressed to such person at the address given in the return filed by him or her pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or in any application made by him or her or, if no such return has been filed or application made, then to the address of the premises immediately adjoining the vault. The mailing of a notice as in this subdivision provided, shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the provisions of this chapter by the giving of notice shall commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice as in this subdivision provided.

b.

However, except in the case of a wilfully false or fraudulent return with intent to evade the vault charge, no assessment shall be made after the expiration of more than three years from the date of such return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as provided by law, the annual vault charge may be assessed at any time.

c. Where, before the expiration of the period prescribed herein for the assessment of an additional vault charge, a person has consented in writing that such period be extended, the amount of such additional vault charge due may be determined at any time within such extended period.

The commissioner of finance and, where relevant, the tax appeals tribunal are authorized to provide by regulation the extent to which the provisions of the preceding sentence with respect to prima facie evidence of delivery and the postmark date shall apply to certified mail.

Failure to pay all charges as provided in this subdivision shall invalidate any amnesty granted pursuant to this section.
