      budget shall have the power, personally or through  representatives,  to
      survey  each  agency  for  the  purpose  of  ascertaining  its budgetary
      requirements.  The director may require any agency, or  any  officer  or

      than the  tenth day of March, each borough president shall submit to the
      mayor  and  council, in such form and containing such information as the
      mayor shall prescribe, any proposed  modifications  of  the  preliminary
      budget  which  the  borough  president recommends in accordance with the
      provisions of subdivision b of this section.
        b.  Each borough president shall propose  such  modifications  to  the
      preliminary  budget  as  the  borough  president deems to be in the best
      interest of the borough, taking into consideration community and borough
      board priorities and testimony received at public hearings held pursuant
      to section  two  hundred  forty-one.    The  net  effects  of  any  such
      modifications  recommended by the borough president may not result in an
      increase in  the  total  amount  of    appropriations  proposed  in  the
      preliminary budget.  If increases in  appropriations  within the borough
      are  recommended,  offsetting  reductions in other appropriations within

      reduction  must  be stated separately and distinctly and refer each to a
      single object or purpose.

      financial  plan shall be based on reasonable and appropriate assumptions
      and methods of estimation. All cash flow projections shall be based upon

      operations  of  the  city  to  be conducted within the cash resources so
      projected.
        (5) A general reserve shall be provided for each fiscal year to  cover
      potential  reductions  in  projected  revenues or increases in projected
      expenditures during each such fiscal year. The amount provided for  such
      general  reserve shall be estimated in accordance with paragraph four of
      this subdivision, but in no event shall it  be  less  than  one  hundred
      million dollars at the beginning of any fiscal year.
        (6)  In the event that the results of the city's operations during the
      preceding fiscal year have not comported  with  subdivision  a  of  this
      section, the first fiscal year included in any financial plan shall make
      provision  for  the repayment of any deficit incurred by the city during
      the preceding fiscal year.
        c. The financial plan shall be developed and may from time to time  be
      modified, in accordance with the following procedures:
        (1)  The  mayor  shall,  in  conjunction  with  the preliminary budget
      prepared pursuant to section one hundred one, prepare a  financial  plan
      covering  the  four ensuing fiscal years (the first year of which is the
      year for which such preliminary budget is being  prepared)  as  well  as
      updating the current fiscal year.
        (2)  After  the  preparation  by  the  mayor  of  a  financial plan in
      accordance with the preceding paragraph, the mayor shall  reexamine,  at
      least on a quarterly basis, the projections of revenues and expenditures
      and  other  estimates contained in the financial plan, and shall prepare
      modifications in accordance with the following procedures:
        (a) The budget message, issued pursuant to section two  hundred  fifty
      of  this chapter, shall include an update of the financial plan covering
    
      the four ensuing fiscal years (the first year of which is the  year  for
      which  such  budget  message is being prepared) as well as an update for
      the current fiscal year.
        (b)  Not  later  than thirty days after the budget is finally adopted,
      the mayor shall issue an update of the financial plan covering the  four
      ensuing  fiscal  years  (the  first  year of which shall be the year for
      which such budget has been adopted) as well as an update for the  fiscal
      year that is ending or has just ended. Such update shall reflect changes
      which  were  made  in the budget in accordance with sections two hundred
      fifty-four and two  hundred  fifty-five;  provided,  however,  that  the
      budget adopted in accordance with such sections shall be consistent with
      the  standards  applicable  to  the  financial  plan  set  forth in this
      section.
        (c) During the second quarter of the  fiscal  year,  the  mayor  shall
      issue  an update of the financial plan covering the fiscal year in which
      such quarter occurs and the three ensuing fiscal years.
        (d) In addition, on such schedule as the mayor deems appropriate,  the
      mayor  may issue further updates of the financial plan during the fiscal
      year.
        d. The financial plan  shall  include  projections  of  all  revenues,
      expenditures  and  cash  flows  (including  but not limited to projected
      capital expenditures and debt issuances) and  a  schedule  of  projected
      capital  commitments  of  the city. In addition, each financial plan and
      financial plan modification shall include a statement of the significant
      assumptions  and  methods  of  estimation  used  in  arriving   at   the
      projections contained therein.
        e.  Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this charter, in the
      event of any change in  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  or
      change in the application of generally accepted accounting principles to
      the  city,  if  the mayor determines that immediate compliance with such
      change will have a material effect on the  city's  budget  over  a  time
      period  insufficient  to  accommodate  the  effect without a substantial
      adverse impact on the delivery of  essential  services,  the  mayor  may
      authorize  and  approve  a  method  of  phasing the requirements of such
      change into the budget over such reasonably expeditious time  period  as
      the mayor deems appropriate.
        f. The powers, duties, and obligations set forth in this section shall
      be  subject to the powers, duties, and obligations placed upon any state
      or local officer or agency, including but not limited to  the  New  York
      state  financial  control  board,  by  or pursuant to the New York State
      Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York, while such act remains
      in effect.
