Section 227. ::    
        
     
        §  227.  Spending pursuant to appropriations.  a. No money, except for
      grants or gifts from private entities, shall be paid from any fund under
      the management of the city, or any fund  under  the  management  of  any
      agency or officer of the city,  or any other entity  the majority of the
      members  of  whose board are city officials or are appointed directly or
      indirectly by city officials, except in pursuance of an appropriation by
      the council or other specific  legal authorization;  provided,  however,
      that
        (1) if at any time the council shall fail to make an appropriation for
      the  payment  of debt service on any debts of the city as they fall due,
      or for the payments to the several sinking funds,  the  commissioner  of
      finance  shall  set  apart,  from the first revenues thereafter received
      applicable to the general fund of the city, a sum sufficient to pay such
      amounts and shall so apply such sum; and
        (2) money, the ownership and equitable title of which  belongs  to  an
      individual,  corporation, organization or government other than the city
      and which is being held by any agency or officer  of  the  city  pending
      transfer  of such money to such individual, corporation, organization or
      government in accordance with the terms and conditions pursuant to which
      it was placed  in  the  custody  of  such  agency  or  officer,  may  be
      transferred  to such individual, corporation, organization or government
      by such agency or officer without an appropriation by law, provided such
      transfers are made in accordance with such terms and conditions; and
        (3)  money or other financial resources  may only be transferred  from
      one  fund to another without specific statutory authorization for such a
      transfer  if that money or those other financial resources    are  being
      loaned  temporarily to   such other fund  and an accurate accounting and
      reporting of the balance of financial resources in each fund and of  the
      amount  due  by  each fund to each other fund is made at the end of each
      month; and
        (4) grants or gifts from private entities exempt from the requirements
      of this section, and expenditures of such funds,  shall  be  subject  to
      disclosure,  at  least  annually,  by the responsible agency, officer or
      entity in a form and containing such  information  as  the  mayor  shall
      prescribe for this purpose by rule.
        b.   The head of each agency of the city, and each entity the majority
      of the  members  of  whose  board  are  city  officials  or  individuals
      appointed  directly or indirectly by city officials, shall, on or before
      the fifteenth day of October in each year, submit to the mayor  and  the
      council,  in  such form as the mayor shall prescribe, a statement of the
      sources, amounts and disposition of all money received by such agency or
      entity, or by a unit or officer of  such  agency  during  the  preceding
      fiscal  year,  other  than  (i)  money  appropriated for the use of such
      agency or entity by the council, or (ii) money paid by  such  agency  or
      entity  into  the city treasury and reported in the annual report of the
      comptroller for such fiscal year.  The mayor shall ensure that copies of
      such statements are available for public inspection, and shall designate
      a city officer to maintain copies of such statements for such purpose.
