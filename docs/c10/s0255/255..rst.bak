Section 255. ::    
        
     
        §  255. Veto of the mayor.  a. The mayor, not later than the fifth day
      after the council  has  acted  upon    the  budget  or  capital  program
      submitted  with  the  executive  budget,  may disapprove any increase or
      addition to the budget, any unit of appropriation, or any change in  any
      term  or  condition  of  the budget.   The mayor, by such date, may also
      disapprove any item or term  or  condition  included  in  such    budget
      pursuant  to  the  provisions of section two hundred forty-three of this
      chapter.   The mayor shall return the  budget    by  that  date  to  the
      council, setting forth objections in writing.
        b.   The council, by a two-thirds vote of all the council members, may
      override any disapproval by the mayor pursuant to subdivision a of  this
      section;  provided,  however,  that  if no such action by the council is
      taken within ten days of such disapproval, the expense budget  to  which
      such  disapprovals  relate  shall  be  deemed adopted as modified by the
      disapprovals by the mayor.
