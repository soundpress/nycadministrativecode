        §  254.    Amendment  and  adoption  of the executive budget. a.   The
      council may not alter the budget as  submitted by the mayor pursuant  to
      section two hundred forty-nine except to increase, decrease, add or omit
      any  unit  of  appropriation for personal service or other than personal
      service or any appropriation for any capital project  or  add,  omit  or
      change   any   terms   or   conditions   related  to  any  or  all  such
      appropriations; provided, however, that each increase or  addition  must
      be  stated  separately  and distinctly from any items of the  budget and
      refer each to a single object or purpose; and, provided,  further,  that
      the  aggregate amount appropriated for capital projects shall not exceed
      the  maximum  amount  of  appropriations  contained   in   the   mayor's
      certificate  issued  pursuant  to  subdivision  sixteen  of  section two
      hundred fifty.
        b. The council shall consider, and act upon, all recommendations  made
      by  the  borough presidents pursuant to section two hundred fifty-one of
      this chapter and all recommendations  made  by  the  mayor  pursuant  to
      paragraph thirteen of section two hundred fifty of this chapter.
        c.  The  budget  when  adopted  by  the council shall become effective
      immediately  without  further  action  by   the   mayor,   except   that
      appropriations  for  the  council or appropriations added to the mayor's
      executive budget by the council or any changes in terms and  conditions,
      shall be subject to the veto of the mayor.
        d.  If an expense budget has not been adopted by the fifth day of June
      pursuant to subdivisions a and b of this section, the expense budget and
      tax rate adopted as modified for the current fiscal year shall be deemed
      to  have  been extended for the new fiscal year until such time as a new
      expense budget has been adopted.
        e. If a capital budget  and a capital program have not been adopted by
      the fifth day of June pursuant to  subdivisions a and b of this section,
      the unutilized portion of all  prior  capital  appropriations  shall  be
      deemed reappropriated.
