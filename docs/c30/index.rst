Title 27: Construction and Maintenance
===================================================

Chapter 2: Housing Maintenance Code
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter 1: General Provisions**




**Article 1: General Provisions**



*§ 27-2001 Short title.* ::


This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "housing maintenance code."






*§ 27-2002 Legislative declaration.* ::


It is hereby found that the enforcement of minimum standards of health and safety, fire protection, light and ventilation, cleanliness, repair and maintenance, and occupancy in dwellings is necessary to protect the people of the city against the consequences of urban blight. The sound enforcement of minimum housing standards is essential:

1. to preserve decent housing;

2. to prevent adequate or salvageable housing from deteriorating to the point where it can no longer be reclaimed; and

3. to bring about the basic decencies and minimal standards of healthful living in already deteriorated dwellings, which, although no longer salvageable, must serve as habitations until they can be replaced. In order to accomplish these purposes, and following a review of existing housing standards in the light of present needs, and a reexamination of methods of administration, including legal sanctions and remedies, to assure the effectiveness of enforcement, it is hereby found that the enactment of a comprehensive code of standards for decent housing maintenance, imposing duties and responsibilities for the preservation of the dwellings in the city upon owners and tenants, as well as on the municipality itself, enforceable by a broad range of legal, equitable and administrative powers, is appropriate for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the people of the city.






*§ 27-2003 Applicability.* ::


The provisions of this chapter, except as otherwise provided, apply to all dwellings.






*§ 27-2004 Definitions.* ::


a. The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the following meanings:

   1. The term department shall mean the department, bureau, division or other agency charged with the enforcement of this title.

   2. Wherever the word or words occupied, is occupied, used, or is used appear, such word or words shall be construed as if followed by the words "or is intended, arranged or designed to be used or occupied".

   3. A dwelling is any building or structure or portion thereof which is occupied in whole or in part as the home, residence or sleeping place of one or more human beings.

   4. A family is:

      (a) A single person occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or

      (b) Two or more persons related by blood, adoption, legal guardianship, marriage or domestic partnership; occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or

      (c) Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit and maintaining a common household; or

      (d) Not more than three unrelated persons occupying a dwelling unit in a congregate housing or shared living arrangement and maintaining a common household; or

      (e) Members of a group home; or

      (f) Foster children placed in accordance with provisions of the New York state social services law, their foster parents, and other persons related to the foster parents by blood, marriage or domestic partnership; where all residents occupy and maintain a common household with not more than two boarders, roomers or lodgers; or

      (g) Up to seven unrelated students enrolled at a single accredited college or university occupying a student apartment, as such term is defined in the New York city building code, and maintaining a common household pursuant to a lease, sublease, or occupancy agreement directly with such college or university, provided that:

         (i) The entire structure in which the dwelling unit is located is fully sprinklered in accordance with chapter 9 of the New York city building code; and

         (ii) Such occupancy does not exceed the maximums contained in subdivision a of section 27-2075; and

         (iii) Prior to commencement of such occupancy, and on an annual basis thereafter such college or university has submitted a fire safety plan containing fire safety and evacuation procedures for such dwelling unit that is acceptable to the fire commissioner and in compliance with any rules promulgated by the fire commissioner; and

         (iv) The dwelling unit complies with additional occupancy and construction requirements as may be established by rule by the department of housing preservation and development or its successor.

      A common household is deemed to exist if every member of the family has access to all parts of the dwelling unit. Lack of access to all parts of the dwelling unit establishes a rebuttable presumption that no common household exists.

   5. "Person," for the purposes of article four of subchapter three of this chapter, means any adult or child over the age of four years. The term "person" as used in subchapters four and five of this code shall include the owner, mortgagee or vendee in possession, assignee of rents, receiver, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or corporation directly or indirectly in control of a dwelling or part thereof.

   6. A private dwelling is any building or structure designed and occupied for residential purposes by not more than two families. Private dwellings shall also be deemed to include a series of one-family or two-family dwelling units each of which faces or is accessible to a legal street or public thoroughfare, if each such dwelling unit is equipped as a separate dwelling unit with all essential services, and if each such unit is arranged so that it may be approved as a legal one-family or two-family dwelling.

   7. A multiple dwelling is a dwelling which is either rented, leased, let or hired out, to be occupied, or is occupied, as the residence or home of three or more families living independently of each other. A multiple dwelling shall also include residential quarters for members or personnel of any hospital staff which are not located in any building used primarily for hospital use, but any building which was erected, altered or converted prior to July first, nineteen hundred fifty-five, to be occupied by such members or personnel or is so occupied on such date shall not be subject to the requirements of this code only so long as it continues to be so occupied if there are local laws applicable to such building and such building is in compliance with such local laws. A multiple dwelling does not include (i) a hospital, convent, monastery, asylum or public institution; or (ii) a fireproof building used wholly for commercial purposes except for not more than one janitor's apartment and not more than one penthouse occupied by not more than two families.

The following uses of a dwelling unit by the permanent occupants thereof shall not be deemed to be inconsistent with occupancy of such dwelling unit for permanent residence purposes:

         (1) (A)    occupancy of such dwelling unit for fewer than thirty consecutive days by other natural persons living within the household of the permanent occupant such as house guests or lawful boarders, roomers or lodgers; or

            (B) incidental and occasional occupancy of such dwelling unit for fewer than thirty consecutive days by other natural persons when the permanent occupants are temporarily absent for personal reasons such as vacation or medical treatment, provided that there is no monetary compensation paid to the permanent occupants for such occupancy.

         (2) In a class A multiple dwelling owned by an accredited not-for-profit college or university or leased by such a college or university under a net lease for a term of forty-nine years or more, the use of designated dwelling units for occupancy for fewer than thirty consecutive days shall not be inconsistent with the occupancy of such multiple dwelling for permanent residence purposes if:

            (A) No more than five percent of the dwelling units in such multiple dwelling but not less than one dwelling unit, are designated for such use and the designation of a unit once made may not be changed to another unit;

            (B) A list of the designated dwelling units certified by an authorized representative of the college or university is kept on the premises by the owner or net lessee and made available upon request for inspection by the department or the fire department of such city;

            (C) Only designated dwelling units on the certified list are used for occupancy for fewer than thirty consecutive days and only by (i) natural persons, other than persons whose only relationship with the college or university is as a student, for whom the college or university has undertaken to provide housing accommodations such as visiting professors and academics, graduate students with research or teaching fellowships, researchers and persons presenting academic papers, interviewing for positions of employment or having other similar business with the college or university, or (ii) natural persons for whom a hospital affiliated with such college or university has undertaken to provide housing accommodations such as patients, patients' families and/or accompanying escorts, medical professionals and healthcare consultants or persons having other similar business with such hospital. A log shall be maintained on the premises of the names and addresses of such persons and the duration and reason for their stay. Such log shall be accessible upon request for inspection by the department and the fire department of such municipality;

            (D) No rent or other payment is collected for such occupancy; and

            (E) The fire department of such city shall require the filing of a fire safety plan or other appropriate fire safety procedure.

      (b) A garden-type maisonette dwelling project is a series of attached, detached or semi-detached dwelling units which are provided as a group collectively with all essential services such as, but not limited to, water supply and house sewers, and which units are located on a site or plot not less than twenty thousand square feet in area under common ownership and erected under plans filed with the department on or after April eighteenth, nineteen hundred fifty-four, and which units together and in their aggregate are arranged or designed to provide three or more apartments.

*§ 27-2006 Duties of tenant.* ::


a. A tenant shall, in addition to complying with all provisions of this code and the multiple dwelling law applicable to him or her, be responsible for violations of this code to the extent that he or she has the power to prevent the occurrence of a violation. A tenant has the power to prevent the occurrence of a violation if:

   (1) It is caused by his or her own wilful act or that of a member of his or her family or household, or a guest; or

   (2) It is the result of such tenant's gross negligence, neglect or abuse, or the gross negligence, neglect or abuse of a member of his or her family, or household or a guest.

b. The tenant, any member of his or her family or household, or his or her guest shall, with respect to the public parts of the premises, be liable if a violation is caused by such tenant's own wilful act, gross negligence, neglect or abuse.

c. The fact that a tenant is or may be liable for a violation of this code or any other law or is found liable for civil or criminal penalties does not relieve the owner of his or her obligation to keep the premises, and every part thereof, in good repair.






*§ 27-2007 Certain specific duties of tenants and others.* ::


In addition to other duties imposed upon him or her by this code, no tenant, or any other person, shall:

a. Remove or render inoperative any self-closing device on any door which is required by any provision of law to be self-closing, or cause or permit such door to be held open by any device;

b. Use, or cause or permit to be installed, a lowered door or screen door in addition to or in place of any required self-closing door to a public hall;

c. Place any encumbrance before or upon, or cause access to be obstructed to, any fire escape, or obstruct by a baby carriage or any encumbrance, the public halls or any required means of egress;

d. Take down, alter, destroy, or in any way deface any sign required by this code to be displayed.

e. Remove or render inoperative any shower head installed by the owner which meets the standards of subdivision P. 104.2 of section P. 104.0 of reference standard RS-16 of the appendix to chapter one of this title.

No tenant shall refuse to permit the owner, or his or her agent or employee, to enter such tenant's dwelling unit or other space under his or her control to make repairs or improvements required by this code or other law or to inspect such apartment or other space to determine compliance with this code or any other provision of law, if the right of entry is exercised at a reasonable time and in a reasonable manner. The department may by regulation restrict the time and manner of such inspections.






*§ 27-2009 Tenant violations as grounds for eviction.* ::


Any conviction of a tenant for violation of this code which:

(1) Results from wilful or grossly negligent conduct and causes substantial damage to the dwelling units; or

(2) Results from repeated or continued conduct which causes damage to the dwelling unit or substantially interferes with the comfort or safety of another person; or

(3) Consists of an unreasonable refusal to afford access to the dwelling unit to the owner or his or her agent or employee for the purpose of making repairs or improvements required by this code, shall constitute grounds for summary proceedings by the owner to recover possession of such dwelling unit from the tenant.






*§ 27-2009.1 Rights and responsibilities of owners and tenants in relation to pets.* ::


a. Legislative declaration. The council hereby finds that the enforcement of covenants contained in multiple dwelling leases which prohibit the harboring of household pets has led to widespread abuses by building owners or their agents, who knowing that a tenant has a pet for an extended period of time, seek to evict the tenant and/or his or her pet often for reasons unrelated to the creation of a nuisance. Because household pets are kept for reasons of safety and companionship and under the existence of a continuing housing emergency it is necessary to protect pet owners from retaliatory eviction and to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of tenants who harbor pets under the circumstances provided herein, it is hereby found that the enactment of the provisions of this section is necessary to prevent potential hardship and dislocation of tenants within this city.

b. Where a tenant in a multiple dwelling openly and notoriously for a period of three months or more following taking possession of a unit, harbors or has harbored a household pet or pets, the harboring of which is not prohibited by the multiple dwelling law, the housing maintenance or the health codes of the city of New York or any other applicable law, and the owner or his or her agent has knowledge of this fact, and such owner fails within this three month period to commence a summary proceeding or action to enforce a lease provision prohibiting the keeping of such household pets, such lease provision shall be deemed waived.

c. It shall be unlawful for an owner or his or her agent, by express terms or otherwise, to restrict a tenant's rights as provided in this section. Any such restriction shall be unenforceable and deemed void as against public policy.

d. The waiver provision of this section shall not apply where the harboring of a household pet causes damage to the subject premise, creates a nuisance or interferes substantially with the health, safety or welfare of other tenants or occupants of the same or adjacent building or structure.

e. The New York city housing authority shall be exempt from the provisions of this section.

**Article 3: Painting**



*§ 27-2013 Painting of public parts and within dwellings.* ::


a. In the public parts of a multiple dwelling, and in a tenant-occupied dwelling unit in a one- or two-family dwelling, the owner shall:

   (1) Paint or cover the walls and ceilings with wallpaper or other acceptable wall covering; and

   (2) Repaint or re-cover the walls and ceilings with wallpaper or other acceptable wall covering whenever necessary in the judgement of the department to keep such surfaces sanitary.

b. In occupied dwelling units in a multiple dwelling, the owner shall:

   (1) Paint or cover the walls and ceilings with wallpaper or other acceptable wall covering; and

   (2) Repaint or re-cover the walls and ceilings with wallpaper or other acceptable wall covering every three years, and more often when required by contract or other provisions of law.

c. The department may require a tenant of a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling to repaint or re-cover the interior walls and ceilings of such tenant's dwelling unit with wallpaper or other acceptable wall covering if such walls and ceilings become unsanitary at any time within three years from the date of the last refinishing by the owner. However, if the tenant can show, to the satisfaction of the department, that the walls and ceilings have become unsanitary through no act or neglect of his or her own or of such tenant's family or guests, the department may require the owner to repaint or re-cover the same. This subdivision does not relieve the owner from his or her duties under paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.

d. The owner and tenant of any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling may, by voluntary agreement, provide that the owner need not repaint in such unit as required by paragraph two of subdivision b of this section for such additional period, not to exceed two years, as may be agreed upon. Such an agreement to extend the time for repainting shall not be valid unless it has been entered into not earlier than one month prior to the expiration of the three-year period, and shall not form part of any agreement of lease. The department may prescribe the form of such agreements, require them to be filed, and may make such other regulations as may be necessary to avoid abuse, and to further the purposes of this article. Notwithstanding any agreement, the department may, during the period for which repainting is deferred by agreement order repainting by the owner in any dwelling unit when deemed necessary to keep the walls and ceilings of such unit sanitary. This subdivision shall not affect the applicability of subdivision c of this section during the three years after any repainting or re-covering.

e. Neither the owner nor a tenant of a dwelling unit shall place wallpaper or wall covering upon a wall or ceiling in the public or tenant-occupied parts of a dwelling unless existing wallpaper or wall covering is first removed and such wall or ceiling is cleaned and repaired. However, if wallpaper or wall covering is in good condition, free from vermin and a coat of acceptable paint or sizing is applied, one additional layer of wallpaper or wall covering may be applied.

f. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to require the owner of a dwelling to cover with wallpaper or other acceptable covering any wall or ceiling not previously so covered by such owner. When a wall or ceiling of a dwelling unit has been decorated with paper, wood paneling, or other material over which paint normally is not applied, the owner shall be relieved of his or her obligation to repaint or recover such wall or ceiling so long as the same remains in a sanitary condition, in the judgment of the department. When the department requires redecoration of such wall or ceiling, the tenant shall remove any paper, wall covering, wood paneling or other material which such tenant has applied before the owner is required to clean and repair and repaint or re-cover. However, if the owner or a former tenant has applied paper, wall covering, wood paneling or other material, the owner shall be responsible for its removal before redecoration.

g. The owner of a multiple dwelling shall keep and maintain records relating to the refinishing of public parts and dwelling units showing when such parts were last painted or papered or covered with acceptable material and who performed the work. Such records shall be open to inspection by the department, and shall be submitted to the department upon request.

**Article 14: Lead Poisoning Prevention and Control**



*§ 27-2056.1 Statement of findings and purposes.* ::


The council finds that lead poisoning from paint containing lead is a preventable childhood disease and a public health crisis. The council further finds that the hazard in dwellings that may occur from paint containing lead is subject to many factors, such as the age of a building and its maintenance. The Council also finds and declares that City government must focus on primary prevention as the essential tool to combat childhood lead poisoning and to achieve the goal of preventing children from suffering the adverse health and other effects of exposure to lead-based paint. The pursuit of primary prevention, which means eliminating lead hazards before children are exposed, has been recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and promoted by leading experts in the field as a critical course of action to protect the health of young children. The Council, therefore, declares that resources must be directed to primary prevention, including identifying children who are most at risk.

The council recognizes that it cannot legislate a single maintenance standard for all dwellings to eliminate this hazard. Instead, the council by enacting this article makes it the responsibility of every owner of a multiple dwelling to investigate dwelling units for lead-based paint hazards and to address such hazards on a case-by-case basis as the conditions may warrant, taking such actions as are necessary to prevent a child from becoming lead poisoned. Having established this responsibility, the council finds that sufficient information exists to guide owners in making determinations about the existence of lead-based paint hazards. See, e.g., United States environmental protection agency, "Identification of Dangerous Levels of Lead; Final Rule" Federal Register, Vol. 66, No. 4 ; United States department of housing and urban development, "Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing" .

The New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested, 5,638 were newly identified with elevated blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or above. The New York city department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that among children tested, 653 were newly identified at or above the department's environmental intervention blood lead level, which is a blood lead level equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter in a single test or two reported blood lead levels between 15 and 19 micrograms per deciliter at least three months apart, and has also reported an overall incidence of 931 children tested with blood lead levels equal to or exceeding 20 micrograms per deciliter. When a child is identified with environmental intervention blood lead levels, the city is obligated to investigate potential sources of the lead poisoning, incurring the expense of an environmental investigation and often times also incurring the expense of medical treatment and remedial education, if necessary. The council finds that these blood lead levels among New York city children constitute a severe health crisis and has established as its goal the elimination of childhood lead poisoning by the year 2010.

In addition, the department of health and mental hygiene has reported for the year 2001 that only 29% of children in New York city are tested both at age one and age two for the disease of lead poisoning even though the testing of all children at age one and age two is mandatory under state law. The council finds that improved screening among these children is critical since children at these ages are at greatest risk for lead poisoning. The council declares that it is reasonable and necessary to increase the rate of blood-lead testing. This local law requires the department of health and mental hygiene to report to the council on progress toward increasing screening rates and reducing the incidence rates of children newly identified with elevated blood lead levels.

The council further finds that the administration and enforcement of the City's lead poisoning prevention programs can be better coordinated. While it is intended that the department of housing preservation and development remain the agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of this article, it is also intended that the department of health and mental hygiene shall have a significant role in the promulgation and interpretation of rules and in the development of necessary procedures pursuant to this article.

*§ 27-2056.3 Owners' responsibility to remediate.* ::


The existence of a lead-based paint hazard in any multiple dwelling where a child of applicable age resides is hereby declared to constitute a condition dangerous to life and health. An owner shall take action to prevent the reasonably foreseeable occurrence of such a condition and shall expeditiously remediate such condition and any underlying defect, when such underlying defect exists, consistent with the work practices established pursuant to section 27-2056.11 of this article, except where lead-contaminated dust is present in such multiple dwelling and the department of health and mental hygiene has made a determination pursuant to paragraph six of subdivision c of section 27-2056.10 of this article.






*§ 27-2056.4 Owners' responsibility to notify occupants and to investigate.* ::


a. In any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty where a child of applicable age resides, and in any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty and before January first, nineteen hundred seventy-eight where a child of applicable age resides and the owner has actual knowledge of the presence of lead-based paint, and in common areas of such multiple dwellings, the owner shall cause an investigation to be made for peeling paint, chewable surfaces, deteriorated subsurfaces, friction surfaces and impact surfaces. Such investigation shall be undertaken at least once a year and more often if necessary, such as when, in the exercise of reasonable care, an owner knows or should have known of a condition that is reasonably foreseeable to cause a lead-based paint hazard, or an occupant makes a complaint concerning a condition that is likely to cause a lead-based paint hazard or requests an inspection, or the department issues a notice of violation or orders the correction of a violation that is likely to cause a lead-based paint hazard. The owner shall ascertain whether a child resides therein pursuant to the requirements of this section.

b. No occupant in a dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling shall refuse or unreasonably fail to provide accurate and truthful information regarding the residency of a child of applicable age therein, nor shall an occupant refuse access to the owner at a reasonable time and upon reasonable prior notice to any part of the dwelling unit for the purpose of investigation and repair of lead-based paint hazards.

c. All leases offered to tenants or prospective tenants in such multiple dwellings must contain a notice, conspicuously set forth therein, which advises tenants of the obligations of the owner and tenant as set forth in this section. Such notice must be in a manner approved by the department, the content of which shall, at a minimum, be in English and Spanish. The owner of such multiple dwelling shall provide the occupant of such multiple dwelling with the pamphlet described in subdivision b of section 17-179 of this code.

d. (1) The owner of such a multiple dwelling shall provide to an occupant of a dwelling unit at the signing of a lease, including a renewal lease, if any, or upon any agreement to lease, or at the commencement of occupancy if there is no lease, a notice in English and Spanish, the form and content of which shall be approved by the department of health and mental hygiene, inquiring whether a child of applicable age resides or will reside therein. If there is a lease, such notice shall be included in such lease or be attached as a rider to such lease. Such notice shall be completed by the occupant at the time of such signing of a lease, including a renewal lease, if any, or such agreement to lease, or at such commencement of occupancy.

   (2) Where an occupant has responded to the notice provided by the owner pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision d of this section by indicating that no child of applicable age resides therein, during the period between the date of such response and the delivery of the notice provided by the owner pursuant to subdivision e of this section during the immediately following year the occupant shall have the responsibility to inform the owner of any child of applicable age that comes to reside therein during such period. In the event such occupant fails to inform the owner of such child as required by this paragraph, and the owner does not otherwise have actual knowledge that such child is residing in the dwelling unit, the presumption provided for in section 27-2056.5 of this article shall not apply in any action to recover damages for personal injury caused by contact with or exposure to lead-based paint or lead-contaminated dust.

e. (1) Each year, an owner of a multiple dwelling erected prior to January first, nineteen hundred sixty shall, no earlier than January first and no later than January sixteenth, except as provided for in subparagraph iii of paragraph two of this subdivision, present to the occupant of each dwelling unit in such multiple dwelling a notice inquiring as to whether a child of applicable age resides therein.

f. The owner shall inform the occupant in writing of the results of an investigation undertaken pursuant to this section and shall provide a copy of any such report received or generated by an investigation. The owner shall retain a copy of each investigation report, for ten years from the date of such report and such report shall be made available to the department on request and shall be transferred by the owner to the owner's successor in title.

g. Any owner who violates the provisions of this section, or the rules promulgated hereunder, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to five hundred dollars or imprisonment for up to six months or both. In addition, any violation of this section shall subject the owner to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand five hundred dollars per violation.

h. The department may, at its discretion, perform sample audits to determine compliance with the requirements of this section.






*§ 27-2056.5 Presumption.* ::


a. In any multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960, it shall be presumed that the paint or other similar surface-coating material in any dwelling unit where a child of applicable age resides or in the common areas is lead-based paint. The presumption established by this section may be rebutted by the owner of the dwelling or dwelling unit by submitting to the department a sworn written statement by the owner supported by lead-based paint testing or sampling results, a sworn written statement by the person who performed the testing if performed by an employee or agent of the owner, and such other proof as the department may require. Testing performed to rebut the presumption may only be performed by a person who has been certified as an inspector or risk assessor in accordance with subparts L and Q of 40 CFR part 745 or any successor regulations. The determination as to whether such proof is adequate to rebut the presumption established by this section shall be made by the department.

b. The owner of a dwelling or a dwelling unit may apply to the department to have such dwelling or dwelling unit exempted from the presumption contained in subdivision a of this section when either (i) an inspection for lead-based paint in such dwelling or dwelling unit, performed in accordance with 40 CFR § 745.227, or any successor regulation, has determined that there is no lead-based paint present in such dwelling or dwelling unit, or (ii) substantial alterations have been made to such dwelling or dwelling unit and such alterations have resulted in the removal or permanent covering of all lead-based paint in that dwelling or dwelling unit. The department shall by rule determine the requirements needed to qualify for such an exemption. Sections 27-2056.4, 27-2056.8 and 27-2056.9 of this article shall not apply to any dwelling or dwelling unit that has been granted an exemption by the department.

c. Any exemption for a dwelling unit granted pursuant to this section prior to the effective date of this subdivision shall remain in effect until: (i) the turnover of such unit on or after the effective date of the rule promulgated by the department pursuant to paragraph (b) of subdivision (7) of section 27-2056.2, (ii) issuance of a denial of a rebuttal of a lead-based paint violation based upon the presumption of lead paint for such dwelling unit filed pursuant to subdivision a of section 27-2056.5, (iii) issuance of a lead-based paint violation based upon testing by the department for such dwelling unit, or (iv) issuance of an order to abate lead-based paint hazards or unsafe lead paint by the department of health and mental hygiene, or upon issuance of a denial of an objection to such a commissioner’s order to abate filed pursuant to section 173.13 of the health code. Upon the expiration of an exemption pursuant to this subdivision, such exemption shall no longer apply and such dwelling unit shall be subject to all applicable provisions of this article. The owner of such a dwelling unit that was previously exempted may apply for a new exemption pursuant to subdivision b of section 27-2056.5. The department shall establish requirements for the owner of a dwelling unit that has been granted an exemption by the department prior to the effective date of this subdivision to notify the department of the turnover of the dwelling unit.








*§ 27-2056.6 Violation in a dwelling unit.* ::


The existence of lead-based paint in any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling where a child of applicable age resides shall constitute a class C immediately hazardous violation if such paint is peeling or is on a deteriorated subsurface.

   (3) provide for the removal or permanent covering of all lead-based paint on all friction surfaces on all doors and door frames; and

   (4) provide for the removal or permanent covering of all lead-based paint on all friction surfaces on all windows, or provide for the installation of replacement window channels or slides on all lead-based painted friction surfaces on all windows.

b. All work performed pursuant to this section shall be performed pursuant to the safe work practices promulgated pursuant to section 27-2056.11(a)(3) of this article.

c. Any owner who fails to comply with the provisions of subdivision a of this section, or the rules of the department of health and mental hygiene or the department promulgated pursuant to section 27-2056.11(a)(3) shall be liable for a class C immediately hazardous violation.






*§ 27-2056.9 Department inspections.* ::


a. When entering a dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling constructed prior to January 1, 1960 for the purpose of investigating the existence of any violation of this code, the department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a child of applicable age resides therein and shall request from the occupant an acknowledgement as to whether such a child resides in the dwelling unit. Whenever a child of applicable age resides in a dwelling unit, the department shall immediately perform a room-by-room inspection of the dwelling unit and record for each room in a report of such inspection whether the paint or other similar surface-coating material in each room is peeling or intact. For each room where peeling paint is found, the department shall also inspect for evidence of an underlying defect and shall indicate on the inspection report the peeling paint's location within the room, the condition of the subsurface below it, and the location of any underlying defect. When performing such inspection, the department need only inspect those portions of the dwelling unit where furniture or other furnishings do not obstruct the view of a surface, except when there is visible evidence that causes the department to believe that the obstructed surface has peeling paint. Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines the existence of a condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall serve a notice of violation within ten additional days.

b. In any dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling erected prior to January 1, 1960 where a child of applicable age resides, the department shall conduct an inspection pursuant to subdivision a of this section no later than ten days after the department's receipt of a complaint describing peeling paint, or a deteriorated subsurface or underlying defect in the dwelling unit. The department shall make diligent efforts to ascertain whether a child of applicable age resides therein. Where the department attempts to perform an inspection of a dwelling unit within the time period required by this subdivision but is unable to gain access, the department shall be required to make a reasonable attempt to gain access to such dwelling unit within five days of such attempt. If the department is unable to gain access to that dwelling unit during this additional time period, the department shall provide written notice to the occupant of such dwelling unit that no further attempts at access shall be made unless a new complaint is submitted.

c. Each inspector who performs an inspection pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall use an x-ray fluorescence analyzer during the course of that inspection to determine whether lead-based paint is present in such dwelling unit except that, for reasons beyond the control of the department, such x-ray fluorescence analysis is unable to be performed during such inspection, the department shall rely on the presumption set forth in subdivision a of section 27-2056.5 of this article. Where peeling paint is found during an inspection of a dwelling unit performed pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the department shall within ten days thereafter perform another inspection of such dwelling unit using an x-ray fluorescence analyzer to determine whether lead-based paint is present in such dwelling unit. Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines the existence of a condition constituting a violation of this article, the department shall serve a notice of violation within ten additional days.

d. The pamphlet developed by the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to section 17-179 of this code shall be left at the premises of the dwelling unit at the time of an inspection made by the department pursuant to this section.

e. The department shall develop a pamphlet listing the work practices to be established pursuant to section 27-2056.11 of this article. Such pamphlet shall be delivered by the department in conjunction with all notices of violation issued pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision l of section 27-2115 of this code. Failure to include such pamphlet with such notices of violation shall not render null and void the service of such notices of violation. Such pamphlet shall also be made available to any member of the public upon request.

f. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, failure by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene to comply with any time period provided in this article or section 27-2115 of this chapter relating to responsibilities of the department and the department of health and mental hygiene, shall not render null and void any notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall not provide a basis for defense or mitigation of an owner's liability for civil penalties for violation of such article.

   (2) the owner acquired the multiple dwelling by sale pursuant to foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide transaction for the purpose of enforcing the debt and not intended to evade the provisions of this section and either (i) a certification of no harassment or waiver thereof was granted with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day period prior to the date of the recording of such mortgage and no suspension or rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or (ii) such mortgage was recorded prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three, or, if such owner is a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section four of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at least twenty savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, a commitment for such mortgage was made prior to May fifth, nineteen hundred eighty-three.

   (2) If the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that such harassment has occurred, the commissioner shall suspend the certification of no harassment or waiver thereof and upon the request of the commissioner, the commissioner of buildings shall not approve any plans or issue an alteration or demolition permit with respect to the alteration or demolition of such multiple dwelling or, if such plans have been approved and an alteration or demolition permit has been issued with respect to such alteration or demolition, issue a stop-work notice and order pursuant to section 27-227 of article twenty-four of subchapter one of the building code. Notice of such suspension shall be mailed to the owner of record of such multiple dwelling and shall be filed with the city register.

   (3) As soon as reasonably possible, but not later than thirty days after such suspension, the commissioner shall hold a hearing in the manner provided in section 27-2092 of this article upon appropriate notice and shall determine whether to rescind such certification; provided, however, that if, prior to the commencement of substantial work, the owner has been found by the office of rent control, the conciliation and appeals board or any court having jurisdiction, to have engaged in harassment, unlawful eviction or arson at the multiple dwelling, the commissioner may rescind such certification without holding a hearing. At such hearing the owner shall have an opportunity to be heard by the commissioner or a designee of the commissioner.

   (4) If the commissioner determines not to rescind such certification, the commissioner shall notify the commissioner of buildings of such determination and any stop-work notice and order issued by the commissioner of buildings pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision shall be vacated immediately.

   (g) For the purpose of any subsequent certification proceeding with respect to such multiple dwelling pursuant to this section, the granting of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for any period of time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section that either no harassment occurred within the time period covered by such certification or that the waiver of such certification for such period of time was appropriate.

h. The commissioner is authorized to establish and collect reasonable fees and charges from applicants for the administrative expenses incurred by the department for the certification proceedings prescribed in this section, including costs for publication and notices.

The department shall ensure that floor area of low income housing required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision is in addition to and not in substitution for floor area of low income housing that may be used by the owner to satisfy an eligibility requirement of any real property tax abatement or exemption program, or of a floor area ratio increase pursuant to section 23-90 of the zoning resolution, for which the owner may apply. The department shall ensure that a city, state or federal subsidy shall not be used for the construction of low income housing required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.

f. Suspension and rescission of a certification.

   (1) The department may rescind a certification of no harassment that was granted for a pilot program building if it finds that harassment has occurred at such building while such certification was in effect, as described by this subdivision.

   (2) If the department has reasonable cause to believe that harassment has occurred during the effective period of a certification of no harassment, the commissioner shall suspend the certification of no harassment for the pilot program building. Upon the request of the department, the department of buildings shall not approve any construction documents or issue an initial or reinstated permit in connection with covered categories of work or, if such documents have been approved or such permit has been issued, issue a stop-work notice and order pursuant to section 28-505.6. Notice of such a suspension of a certification of no harassment shall be mailed to the applicant, the owner of record of such pilot program building and known tenants of such building and shall be filed with the city register or Richmond county clerk.

   (3) As soon as reasonably possible after a request for a hearing by an owner who has received a notice of suspension, but not later than 30 days after such suspension, the department shall commence a proceeding at the office of administrative trials and hearings by filing the required pleadings. At the hearing, the owner of a pilot program building for which a certification of no harassment has been suspended shall have the opportunity to be heard. Notice of such hearing shall be given to the applicant, such other persons and known tenants of such building in the manner prescribed by the office of administrative trials and hearings. The department may receive testimony from such other persons and known tenants of such building. The department shall determine whether to rescind the certification of no harassment within 45 days of receiving the report and recommendation from the office of administrative trials and hearings.

   (4) If the owner has been found by New York state homes and community renewal or any court having jurisdiction to have engaged in harassment, unlawful eviction, or arson at the pilot program building after the certification of no harassment was granted, the department may determine whether to rescind such certification without commencing a proceeding at the office of administrative trials and hearings.

   (5) If the department determines not to rescind such certification of no harassment, the department shall notify the department of buildings of such determination and any stop work notice and order issued by the department of buildings pursuant to section 28-505.6 shall be vacated immediately. Notice of such determination shall be mailed to the owner of record of such pilot program building, the known tenants of such building and filed with the city register or the Richmond county clerk.

   (6) If the department determines that such certification of no harassment shall be rescinded, notice of such determination accompanied by written findings indicating the grounds for such determination shall be provided to the department of buildings and shall be mailed to the owner of record of such pilot program building and filed with the city register or the Richmond county clerk. Such determination shall be subject to review pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and rules.

g. For the purpose of any subsequent proceeding with respect to a pilot program building, the granting of a certification of no harassment or a waiver thereof for any period of time shall be conclusive proof only for the purposes of this section that no harassment occurred within the time period covered by such certification or that the waiver of such certification for such time period was appropriate.

h. Fees. The department is authorized to establish by rule reasonable fees from applicants for the administrative expenses incurred by the department for issuing the certification of no harassment pursuant to this section, including costs for publication and notices.

i. Waiver. The commissioner may grant a waiver of certification of no harassment although the commissioner determines that harassment has occurred at the pilot program building for which such certification is sought during the 60 month period prior to the date of the submission of an application for a certification of no harassment if the commissioner finds that:

   (1) (A) the owner of record of the pilot program building was the owner of record prior to November 29, 2017 or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such pilot program building which was recorded prior to such date or, with respect to a certification proceeding where the alterations sought to be performed are of the type prescribed by rule of the commissioner pursuant to item 5 of section 28-505.3, the owner of record of such multiple dwelling was the owner of record of such multiple dwelling prior to the date of the first publication of such rule or had entered into a contract of sale for the purchase of such multiple dwelling which was recorded prior to such date;

      (B) such owner was not the owner of such multiple dwelling during any period of time in which such harassment occurred and did not at such pilot program building (i) otherwise engage or participate in such harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment; and

      (C) such owner acquired title pursuant to a bona fide transaction that is not intended to evade the provisions of this section; or

   (2) the owner acquired the multiple dwelling by sale pursuant to foreclosure of a mortgage or pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure of a mortgage; provided, however, that such conveyance was a bona fide transaction for the purpose of enforcing the debt and not intended to evade the provisions of this section and either:

      (i) a certification of no harassment or waiver thereof was granted with respect to such multiple dwelling within a sixty day period prior to the date of the recording of such mortgage and no suspension or rescission thereof was recorded prior to such date; or

      (ii) such mortgage was recorded prior to November 29, 2017 or, if such owner is a banking organization as defined in section 2 of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section 4 of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least 20 savings banks or by at least 20 savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, a commitment for such mortgage was made prior to such date.

   (3) In determining whether a transaction described in this subdivision was bona fide, the commissioner may consider whether at such pilot project building or any other multiple dwelling such owner did (i) otherwise engage or participate in harassment; or (ii) with intent that harassment be performed, agree with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of harassment; or (iii) with intent that another person engage in conduct constituting harassment, solicit, request, command, importune or otherwise attempt to cause such person to engage in conduct constituting harassment. The commissioner may also consider the relationship between the parties to the transaction.

   (4) A waiver of a certification pursuant to this subdivision shall state the findings of the commissioner.

If the owner of a multiple dwelling is a corporation, the identification shall also include the names and addresses of any person whose share of ownership of the corporation exceeds twenty-five percent. For the purposes of this subdivision, any person owning a share of a parent corporation shall be deemed to be an owner of a share of a subsidiary corporation equal to the product of the percentage of his or her ownership of the parent corporation multiplied by the percentage of the parent corporation's ownership of the subsidiary corporation.

The telephone number contained in the registration statement shall not constitute a public record and shall be accessible only to duly authorized employees or officers of the department and used exclusively by such personnel in connection with an emergency arising on the premises for which the owner is responsible under the provisions of the multiple dwelling law or this code.

*§ 27-2099 Registration statement; change of ownership or title.* ::


a. When the owner of a dwelling, who is required to register under this article, conveys title to the dwelling to another, the transferor shall, on the day of such transfer, notify the department by regular mail of the name, residence and business address of the new owner, or, if the new owner is a corporation, of the name and address of such corporation. The registration statement in accordance with section 27-2098 of this article shall be presented by the new owner to the office of the register of the city of New York, or the county clerk as required by subdivision c of this section if such owner records such deed, or to the department if the deed is not recorded, and in no event more than five days from the date of taking of title; however, the failure by a new owner to file such registration statement shall not impair the validity of his or her title.

Such registration statements and the fees therefor shall be forwarded to the department for filing and acceptance.

d. (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, after thirty days have elapsed from the date that title to a dwelling is conveyed to a new owner or devolves upon a new owner by operation of law, if the new owner has not filed a registration statement in relation to such dwelling, the department may invalidate the former owner's last valid registration for such dwelling upon application by such former owner for the limited purpose of service of notices or orders authorized or required under this code to be served by the department upon the last registered owner or last registered managing agent. To effect such limited invalidation, the former owner shall submit such documentation as is satisfactory to the department that the ownership of the dwelling has changed and that such former owner no longer owns the dwelling; provided, however, that such registration shall remain valid for all purposes until the department informs such former owner in writing that such registration has been invalidated for such limited purpose.

   (2) Where a notice or order is authorized or required under this code to be served by the department upon the last registered owner or last registered managing agent and the department has invalidated the last valid registration pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision for the limited purpose of service of notices or orders, such service may be made by personal delivery of the notice or order to a person in direct or indirect control of the premises or by mailing a copy thereof to the attention of "owner" or "managing agent" at such dwelling; provided, however, that such manner of service is authorized only until such time as a valid registration is subsequently filed for the dwelling.

The notice to the department shall set forth the registration number and address of the building and the name and address of the owner together with an affidavit of proof of service upon the owner. Service upon the owner may be made by delivery of a copy personally to the owner or any officer, if the owner is a corporation, by registered mail to the address of any owner or officer, as set forth in the registration statement, or by delivery of a copy to any person of suitable age and discretion at the address of the owner or any officer as set forth in the registration statement. Prior to the effective termination date, the owner shall file with the department a statement designating a qualified successor.

c. If the designation of a managing agent shall cease to be effective as a result of death or judicial declaration of incompetence of the agent or his or her disqualification because of removal from New York city, the owner shall file a statement with the department within eight days thereafter designating a qualified successor.

*§ 27-2103 Extension of time for registration.* ::


In any case where the owner or other person required to file is unable to comply with the registration requirements within the applicable time period specified in this article, the department may, upon good cause shown, extend the registration period and waive the penalties for failure to register set forth in section 27-2107 of this article during such period.

a. The failure of the owner or lessee of an entire multiple dwelling to produce the receipt issued by the department acknowledging the filing of a registration statement, or the failure of a managing agent to produce the receipt issued by the department acknowledging the filing of a notice of termination, shall be prima facie evidence of failure to comply with the provisions of this article.

**Article 3: Speculation Watch List**



*§ 27-2109.51 Definitions.* ::


For the purposes of this article:

Capitalization rate. The term “capitalization rate” means, with respect to a multiple dwelling, the quotient obtained when the net operating income of such multiple dwelling, as calculated by the department of finance, is divided by the sale price of such multiple dwelling’s most recent arms-length sale.

Qualified transaction. The term “qualified transaction” means a multiple dwelling sale transaction as defined by department rule pursuant to subdivision b of section 27-2019.52.*



* Editor's note: so in original; citation should likely be to subdivision b of section 27-2109.52.






*§ 27-2109.52 Speculation watch list.* ::


a. Within 300 days after the effective date of the local law that added this section, the department shall establish a speculation watch list. Such speculation watch list shall comprise certain multiple dwellings that contain six or more dwelling units in which a majority of such units are rent regulated, and shall be created by analyzing the capitalization rate for qualified transactions involving such multiple dwellings and applying the criteria promulgated by rule pursuant to subdivision b of this section.

b. The department shall promulgate by rule the criteria for inclusion of a multiple dwelling on the speculation watch list established pursuant to subdivision a. Such rules shall define a qualified transaction for purposes of analyzing capitalization rate, and may also include, but need not be limited to, establishing the amount or ratio per dwelling unit of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations, the amount or ratio per dwelling unit of paid or unpaid emergency repair charges, and the number of dwelling units, for purposes of including a multiple dwelling on the speculation watch list. The department may also promulgate by rule the criteria for removal of a multiple dwelling from the speculation watch list in instances where the department’s analysis of the multiple dwelling has changed, or the multiple dwelling has entered into a regulatory agreement with the department requiring the operation of such building as affordable housing or the stabilization of rents in such building, or the multiple dwelling has obtained a certification of no harassment from the department.

c. The department shall post the following on its website:

   1. The speculation watch list established pursuant to this article;

   2. The criteria for inclusion on such list promulgated pursuant to subdivision b; and

   3. The capitalization rate for each qualified transaction in a non-proprietary format that permits automated processing, to the extent that the disclosure of such information is not prohibited by any other provisions of law.

d. Such buildings on such list may be prioritized by the department for preservation programs or initiatives or may be subject to referral for appropriate enforcement of all applicable laws and rules.

e. The department shall update the speculation watch list on a quarterly basis or, in the department’s discretion, more frequently.

f. Where a building is the subject of a regulatory agreement with the department requiring the operation of such building as affordable housing or the stabilization of rents in such building, in a manner determined by the department, such building shall not be included on the speculation watch list.

g. On or after January 1, 2021, the department may change the methodology for identifying multiple dwellings for inclusion on the speculation watch list by amending its rules promulgated under subdivision b of this section to provide for alternative criteria, including but not limited to replacement of the capitalization rate as a criterion, for inclusion on the speculation watch list. In the event the department replaces capitalization rate as a criterion for inclusion on the speculation watch list, the department shall provide a report to the council at the same time that includes its rationale for such replacement, and shall substitute the posting of the capitalization rate provided for in paragraph 3 of subdivision c of this section with the posting of the metric replacing the capitalization rate as a criterion for inclusion on the speculation watch list.

*§ 27-2114 Responsibility of stockholders of corporations owning multiple dwellings declared nuisances.* ::


a. The term "nuisance" shall be held to embrace public nuisance as known at common law or in equity jurisprudence. Whatever is dangerous to human life or detrimental to health, and whatever dwelling is overcrowded with occupants or is not provided with adequate ingress or egress or is not sufficiently supported, ventilated, sewered, drained, cleaned or lighted in reference to its intended or actual use, and whatever renders the air or human food or drink unwholesome, are also severally, in contemplation of this section, nuisances. All such nuisances are unlawful.

b. Whenever the department shall certify that any multiple dwelling, or any part of its premises, or the plumbing, sewerage, drainage, lighting or ventilation thereof, is in a condition or in effect dangerous to life or detrimental to health, the department may, after giving notice to the owner and an opportunity to be heard at a hearing held for such purpose, declare the same, to the extent it may specify, a public nuisance. Such declaration shall be filed in the central violation bureau as provided by section three hundred twenty-eight of the multiple dwelling law, if applicable, or as a public record in the department. The officers of a corporation upon which notice of such hearing has been served, other than a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section one hundred seven of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at least twenty savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, shall serve similar notice on all stockholders of record of the corporation and other persons known to be stockholders or beneficial owners of the stock of the corporation. A stockholder upon whom such notice has been served shall serve similar notice upon any persons holding a beneficial interest in such stockholder's stock.

c. The department may order such nuisance to be removed in accordance with the provisions of article five of this subchapter, and if any order of the department is not complied with, then, as an alternative to proceeding under the provisions of article five of this subchapter, if the multiple dwelling involved shall have been declared to be a public nuisance pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such declaration shall have been filed as therein provided, the department or a receiver appointed pursuant to article six of this subchapter or section three hundred nine of the multiple dwelling law or any tenant of such multiple dwelling may institute and maintain an action in the supreme court or in the housing part of the New York city civil court in the county where the multiple dwelling is located against any owner or owners to whom the order was issued pursuant to section 27-2125 of article five of this subchapter for an order compelling such owner or owners to comply with the department's order and, if such action be brought by such receiver or tenant, for payment of the costs and disbursements of the action including legal fees. Except as owners may have otherwise agreed, any owner who removes or remedies the nuisance in compliance with an order of the department or court shall be entitled to recover a proportionate share of the total expense of such compliance from all other owners to whom the department's order was issued or to whom such owner sent a copy of the department's order within thirty days of receipt of same by registered mail.

d. Whenever a multiple dwelling shall have been declared a public nuisance to any extent pursuant to subdivision b of this section and such declaration shall have been filed as therein provided, the term "owner" shall be deemed to include, in addition to persons mentioned in the definition of the term in section four of the multiple dwelling law, all the officers, directors and persons having an interest in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock of the owner as herein defined, as holder or beneficial owner thereof, if such owner be a corporation other than a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section one hundred seven of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at least twenty savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, and thereupon any corporation which is included in the term "owner" as provided in this subdivision d shall file an additional statement of registration within ten days which shall contain the name and residence and business address of each director and stockholder of the corporation and of each person known to have any beneficial interest in such stock.

e. Whenever a multiple dwelling shall have been declared a public nuisance to any extent pursuant to subdivision b of this section, and such declaration shall have been filed as therein provided, all officers, directors and persons having an interest, as holder or beneficial owner thereof, in more than ten percent of the issued and outstanding stock of any corporation other than a banking organization as defined in section two of the banking law, a national banking association, a federal savings and loan association, the mortgage facilities corporation, savings banks life insurance fund, the savings banks retirement system, an authorized insurer as defined in section one hundred seven of the insurance law, or a trust company or other corporation organized under the laws of this state all the capital stock of which is owned by at least twenty savings banks or by at least twenty savings and loan associations or a subsidiary corporation all of the capital stock of which is owned by such trust company or other corporation, then in operation and control of such multiple dwelling, shall, in addition to all other liabilities and penalties provided in this code and elsewhere, be jointly and severally liable for all injury to person or property thereafter sustained by any tenant of such multiple dwelling or any other person by reason of the condition constituting such public nuisance and for all costs and disbursements including attorney's fees of any suit brought by such tenant or other person.

f. No civil or criminal liability or penalty shall attach to any person by reason of such person's ownership or beneficial ownership of stock in a corporation owning a multiple dwelling declared to be a public nuisance pursuant to subdivision b of this section because of his or her failure to comply with any of the provisions of this code, whose interest in such corporation is less than twenty-five per cent of the issued and outstanding stock thereof, as owner or beneficial owner thereof, and who has sustained the burden of proving that he or she has not participated directly or indirectly in the management, operation or control of such multiple dwelling.

g. No civil or criminal liability or penalty shall attach to any person by reason of such person's ownership or beneficial ownership of stock in a corporation owning a multiple dwelling declared to be a public nuisance pursuant to subdivision b of this section because of his or her failure to comply with any of the provisions of this code unless and until such person has had a reasonable period of time to comply following his or her having become an owner as defined in this code.

h. No civil or criminal liability or penalty shall attach to any person who shall by operation of law become an owner of a multiple dwelling then or thereafter certified and declared a public nuisance to any extent pursuant to subdivision b of this section, or the holder or beneficial owner of stock in such owner, if a corporation, because of his or her failure to comply with any of the provisions of this code and of the multiple dwelling law for a period of six months after he or she acquired ownership of said multiple dwelling or the stock or beneficial interest in the stock of a corporation which is the owner.







**Article 2: Civil Penalty**



*§ 27-2115 Imposition of civil penalty.* ::


(a) A person who violates any law relating to housing standards shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars for each non-hazardous violation, not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than one hundred dollars and ten dollars per day for each hazardous violation, fifty dollars per day for each immediately hazardous violation, occurring in a multiple dwelling containing five or fewer dwelling units, from the date set for correction in the notice of violation until the violation is corrected, and not less than fifty dollars nor more than one hundred fifty dollars and, in addition, one hundred twenty-five dollars per day for each immediately hazardous violation, occurring in a multiple dwelling containing more than five dwelling units, from the date set for correction in the notice of violation until the violation is corrected. A person wilfully making a false certification of correction of a violation shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than fifty dollars nor more than two hundred fifty dollars for each violation falsely certified, in addition to the other penalties herein provided.

(b) The department shall serve a notice of violation upon the owner, his or her agent or other person responsible for its correction. The notice shall identify the condition constituting the violation, the provision of law applicable thereto, the department's order number, the classification of the violation according to its degree of hazard, the time for certifying the correction of such violation, and the amount of the possible penalty. It shall also advise that the department will, if requested, confer with the owner or his or her representative concerning the nature and extent of the work to be done to insure compliance and the methods of financing such work. In any case where the provisions of this section authorize the service of such notice by mail, the statement of any officer, clerk, or agent of the department, or of anyone authorized by the department to mail such notice of violation, subscribed and affirmed by such person as true under the penalties of perjury, which describes the mailing procedure used by the department, or by the department's mailing vendor, or which states that these procedures were in operation during the course of mailing a particular cycle of notices of violation, shall be admitted into evidence as presumptive evidence that a regular and systematic mailing procedure is followed by the department for the mailing of its notices of violation. Where the department introduces into evidence the business records which correspond to the various stages of the mailing of a particular cycle of notices of violation, pursuant to subdivision (c) of rule forty-five hundred eighteen of the civil practice law and rules, then a presumption shall have been established that the mailing procedure was followed in the case of such cycle, and that such notice of violation has been duly served.

(c) The said notice of violation shall also specify the date by which each violation shall be corrected. Such date shall be:

   (1) ninety days from the date of mailing of the notice in the case of non-hazardous violations;

   (2) thirty days from the date of mailing of the notice in the case of hazardous violations; and

   (3) twenty-four hours in the case of immediately hazardous violations in which case the notice shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the city as the owner or agent, or, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice shall be served on the managing agent. Service of the notice shall be deemed completed five days from the date of mailing. The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds, or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation occurs or such other part of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair. In the case of immediately hazardous violations such showing must be made prior to the close of business on the next full day the department is open following the period set for correction. The department may condition such postponement upon the applicant's written agreement to correct all violations placed against the premises by the department or other appropriate governmental agency and to satisfy within an appropriate period of time, all sums owing to the department for repairs made to said premises. The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set by the postponement. The department shall prepare a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for the postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for postponement and said written statement shall be part of the record of the department.

(d) On or before September first, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the department shall classify all violations of the multiple dwelling law, the housing maintenance code and other applicable state and local laws as non-hazardous, hazardous and immediately hazardous, secure the approval thereof by the advisory council to the housing part of the civil court of the city of New York and publish such classification in the City Record. Such classification shall be based on the effect of the violation upon the life, health or safety of the occupants of the building and upon the public. After October first, nineteen hundred seventy-two and prior to October fifteenth, nineteen hundred seventy-two, the department shall hold a public hearing on the proposed classifications. Notice of such public hearing shall be published in the City Record not less than thirty days prior to the hearing. Within fifteen days after the conclusion of the said hearing, the department shall forward to the advisory council the list with such proposed changes as it may recommend for their approval. Within ten days of the receipt of such list, the advisory council shall advise the department as to which changes they have approved. The department shall thereupon, within five days, cause the list, together with such changes as have been approved to be published once each week for two successive weeks in the City Record. Any person who may be aggrieved as an owner or tenant may, within thirty days of such first publication seek a review of the department's action, provided that no such review shall stay the effectiveness of such list or the operation of the housing part of the civil court of the city of New York. Thereafter, and from time to time, the department may modify the list with the approval of the advisory council after publication, and public hearing as provided for the original list.

(e) In the event the department fails to promulgate such list as above provided, or to take any step in connection therewith within the time provided, the administrative judge of the civil court and the judicial conference may take such action as they deem necessary to insure the establishment of the housing part of the New York city civil court and its operation on April first, nineteen hundred seventy-three, as provided by law.

(f) (1) The notice of violation shall direct that when any violations of a particular class have been corrected, they may be certified at one time to the department or, in the alternative, each violation may be separately and independently certified. Such certification shall be made in writing, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent except that, in the alternative, such certification may be submitted in an electronic form in accordance with the rules of the department which shall provide a mechanism for authenticating the source of the electronic submission; the department shall be required to accept such electronic submissions if submitted in accordance with such rules on and after the effective date of the local law that added these provisions authorizing such electronic submissions. Such certification shall be delivered to the department in person or electronically and acknowledgement of receipt therefor obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than fourteen days after the date set for correction in the case of non-hazardous and hazardous violations, and no later than five days after the date set for correction in the case of immediately hazardous violations, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected. Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement, which may be submitted in an electronic form in accordance with the rules of the department, by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner.

   (2) A copy of such certification shall then be mailed not more than twelve calendar days from the date of receipt of notification to any complainant by the department.

   (3) Such violation shall be deemed corrected seventy days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department unless the department has determined by a reinspection made within such period that the violation still has not been corrected and has recorded such determination upon its records and has notified the person who executed the certification by registered or certified mail to the address stated in the certification that it has been set aside and the reasons therefor; a copy of such notice shall be sent to the complainant.

   (4) If the department does not inspect the premises after notification by the complainant that a violation has not been corrected, any tenant affected by such false certification shall have the right to apply to the court for a determination of violation as provided in subdivision (h) of this section, at which time the court shall assess appropriate penalties as provided in this section for any wilfully false certification it finds.

   (5) Upon receipt of notice that the certification has been set aside the owner or his or her agent shall then have a right to apply to the court for a determination that such violation was corrected. Notice of such right shall appear on each notice that a certification has been set aside.

   (6) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an owner files with his or her certification a copy of a contract of sale or letter of commitment for a mortgage or refinancing of a mortgage covering the premises and further certifies that such sale or mortgage transaction is to occur within one hundred days of such certification, such violation shall be deemed corrected thirty days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department, unless the department has determined by reinspection made within such period that the violation still has not been corrected, has recorded such determination upon its records and has given notice of such determination to the owner, and has thereafter brought an action within thirty days to set aside such certification, to impose a penalty for false certification and to collect such other penalties as have accrued, provided that in all such cases, the department shall make such reinspection.

   (7) Failure to file such certification of compliance shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected.

   (8) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, where (A) the department has performed two or more complaint-based inspections in the same dwelling unit within a twelve-month period, (B) each such inspection has resulted in the issuance of a hazardous or immediately hazardous violation, and (C) not all such violations have been certified as corrected pursuant to this section, the department may impose an inspection fee of two hundred dollars for the third and for each subsequent complaint-based inspection that it performs in such dwelling unit within the same twelve-month period that results in the issuance of a hazardous or immediately hazardous violation, provided that the department may by rule increase the fee for inspections performed during the period of October first through May thirty-first. Such inspection fee shall be in addition to any civil penalties that may be due and payable.

      (ii) Such fee shall not be applicable to inspections (A) performed in a multiple dwelling that is active in the alternative enforcement program pursuant to article ten of subchapter five of this chapter, (B) performed in a multiple dwelling that is subject to a court order appointing an administrator as the result of a proceeding brought by the department pursuant to article seven-a of the New York state real property actions and proceedings law, (C) performed pursuant to subparagraph iv of paragraph one of subdivision k of this section, (D) resulting exclusively in hazardous or immediately hazardous violations for inoperable smoke detectors, inoperable carbon monoxide detectors, double cylinder locks on entry doors of dwelling units, illegal window gates, absence of window guards, or such other hazardous or immediately hazardous violations that the department specifies by rule or (E) where an owner has notified the department of his or her objection to such fee pursuant to section 27-2129 of this code, has provided such documentation to the department as it shall prescribe by rule regarding such owner's attempted access for the purpose of making repairs to the dwelling unit that is subject to the inspection fee, and the department has reviewed and approved such objection.

      (iii) All fees that remain unpaid shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien upon the premises, and upon the rents and other income thereof. The provisions of article eight of subchapter five of this chapter shall govern the effect and enforcement of such debt and lien.

(g) When there are a number of separate instances of a single condition which violates any housing standard established by law, such separate instances shall be treated collectively as a single violation with respect to any one dwelling unit, or with respect to the public area of a building, but nothing contained in this subdivision shall limit the number of violations for which a penalty under this section may be collected with respect to each dwelling unit or the public area of a building.

(h) (1) Should the department fail to issue a notice of violation upon the request of a lawful occupant or group of lawful occupants within thirty days of the date of such request, or if there is a notice of violation outstanding respecting the premises in which the lawful occupant or group of lawful occupants resides, or, if there is a claim of harassment pursuant to subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter, the lawful occupant or any group of lawful occupants, may individually or jointly apply to the housing part for an order directing the owner and the department to appear before the court. Such order shall be issued at the discretion of the court for good cause shown, and shall be served as the court may direct. If the court finds a condition constituting a violation exists, it shall direct the owner to correct the violation and, upon failure to do so within the time set for certifying the correction of such violation pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, it shall impose a penalty in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section. Nothing in this section shall preclude any person from seeking relief pursuant to any other applicable provision of law.

   (2) (i) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, where one or more allegations of harassment pursuant to subparagraphs b, c and g of paragraph 48 of subdivision a of section 27-2004 of this chapter is made, to the extent that any such allegation is based on physical conditions of a dwelling or dwelling unit, such allegation must be based at least in part on one or more violations of record issued by the department or any other agency. Where any allegation of harassment is based on more than one physical condition, the existence of at least one violation of record with respect to any such physical condition shall be deemed sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

      (ii) The provisions of subparagraph i of this paragraph shall apply to any counterclaim or defense presented by a tenant in any proceeding in the housing part of the civil court if such counterclaim or defense is based on one or more allegations of harassment. In the event there is no violation of record with respect to at least one physical condition alleged by such tenant such counterclaim or defense shall be dismissed without prejudice.

(i) In the event an owner fails to correct a violation within the time specified in a notice of violation sent to the owner, his or her agent or other person responsible for its correction pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, or within any additional time granted pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, and no certification of correction with respect to such violation has been filed by the owner or his or her registered managing agent in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (f) hereof, then at any time after thirty days have elapsed from the date such violation was to be corrected, any tenant or group of tenants who requested that the violation be issued may apply individually or jointly, to the housing part for an order directing the owner and the department to appear before the court. Where the violation is hazardous or immediately hazardous, the thirty-day requirement shall be waived. Said order shall be issued by the court for good cause shown. If the court finds that the violation has not been corrected, that more than thirty days have elapsed since the time to correct same has expired where a violation is non-hazardous, and that no certification of correction has been filed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (f) hereof, then it shall direct the owner to correct the violation and shall assess penalties as provided in subdivision (a) of this section.

(j) If a tenant seeks an order directing the owner and the department to appear before the court pursuant to subdivision (h) or (i) of this section, the court may allow service of the order by the tenant by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

(k) (1) (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty nor more than five hundred dollars per day for each violation from and including the date the notice is affixed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision until the date the violation is corrected and not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars per day for each subsequent violation of such sections at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling that occurs within two consecutive calendar years or, in the case of subdivision a of section 27-2029, during two consecutive periods of October first through May thirty-first. A person who violates subdivision b of section 27-2029 of this chapter shall be subject to a civil penalty of twenty-five dollars per day from and including the date the notice is affixed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision until the date the violation is corrected but not less than one thousand dollars. There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the affixing of the notice.

      (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and section 27-2116 of this chapter, the civil penalties set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be deemed satisfied for a first violation of section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 of this chapter if a notice, in a form prescribed by the department, that such violation has been corrected by the owner or an agent or employee of the owner within twenty-four hours of the affixing of the notice of such violation pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, and a payment of two hundred fifty dollars, are submitted to the department within ten days of affixing the notice of such violation. A person who submits a false notice of correction shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars for each false notice of correction, in addition to the other penalties herein provided. If the notice of correction and payment are not received within such ten-day period then the penalties set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be applicable to such violations and the department may commence a proceeding for an order to correct and to recover such penalties in accordance with this section and section 27-2116 of this chapter. A person who has violated section 27-2028, subdivision a of section 27-2029, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 of this chapter may allege as a defense or in mitigation of liability for civil penalties, compliance with the notice of correction and payment requirements of this subparagraph in any proceeding brought by the department seeking civil penalties under this subdivision. The process for submission of the notice of correction and payment set forth in this subparagraph shall not be available if a violation of section 27-2028, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 of this chapter occurred at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling during the prior calendar year or, in the case of subdivision a of section 27-2029 of this chapter, if a violation of such subdivision occurred at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling during the prior period of October first through May thirty-first.

      (iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within five business days from the date of receipt of the notice of correction by the department, the department shall mail to the occupant of any dwelling unit for which such violation was issued notification that the owner has submitted a notice of correction for such violation. The notification to the occupant shall include information on when the violation was reportedly corrected and how the occupant may object to such notice of correction. In addition, the provisions of paragraphs 4 and 5 of subdivision f of this section shall also be applicable to a notice of correction submitted in compliance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph.

      (iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who, after inspection by the department, is issued an immediately hazardous violation for a third or any subsequent violation of section 27-2028, section 27-2031 or section 27-2032 of this chapter at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling within the same calendar year or, in the case of subdivision a of section 27-2029 of this chapter, at the same dwelling or multiple dwelling within the same period of October first through May thirty-first, shall be subject to a fee of two hundred dollars for each inspection that results in the issuance of such violation as well as any civil penalties that may be due and payable for the violation, provided, however, that such fee shall not be applicable to inspections performed in a multiple dwelling that is included in the alternative enforcement program pursuant to article ten of subchapter five of this chapter. All fees that remain unpaid shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner and a lien upon the premises, and upon the rents and other income thereof. The provisions of article eight of subchapter five of this chapter shall govern the effect and enforcement of such debt and lien.

   (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall serve a notice upon the owner, his or her agent or other person responsible for the correction of violations by affixing such notice in a conspicuous place on the premises. The notice shall identify the condition constituting the violation, the provision of law applicable thereto, the date the violation was reported and set the penalty attendant thereto.

   (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations placed pursuant to article eight of subchapter two of this code, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this article may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:

      (i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or

      (ii) That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation occurs, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair; or

      (iii) That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or

      (iv) That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act or negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner; or

      (v) That in addition to any other defense or mitigation set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, with respect to an owner who may be subject to the penalty of not less than five hundred nor more than one thousand dollars per day with respect to a subsequent violation pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, documentation of prompt and diligent efforts to correct the conditions that gave rise to an initial violation and that such conditions were corrected. Where demonstrated, such subsequent violation shall be treated as though it was an initial violation. However, this defense or mitigation may not be asserted or demonstrated where the initial and subsequent violations occurred in the same calendar year or, in the case of violations of subdivision a of section 27-2029, during the same period of October first through May thirty-first.

   Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data, and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.

   If the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violation, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.

(l) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected, which shall be twenty-one days after service of the notice of violation, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement. The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with the work practices established in accordance with section 27-2056.11 of this code. The notice of violation shall be served by personal delivery to a person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent, or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by certified mail with proof of delivery, to the person in charge of the premises or to the person last registered with the department as the owner or agent; provided that where a managing agent has registered with the department, such notice of violation shall be served on the managing agent. Service of the notice of violation shall be deemed completed three days from the date of mailing. Notification, in a form to be determined by the department, of the issuance of such violation shall be sent simultaneously by regular mail to the occupant at the dwelling unit that is the subject of such notice of violation. The department may postpone the date by which a violation shall be corrected upon a showing, made within the time set for correction in the notice, that prompt action to correct the violation has been taken but that full correction cannot be completed within the time provided because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as may be necessary to make the required repair. Such postponement shall not exceed fourteen days from the date of correction set forth in the notice of violation. The department may require such other conditions as are deemed necessary to insure correction of the violations within the time set for the postponement. The department may grant one additional postponement of no more than fourteen days for the reasons authorized by this section so long as the paint or other condition which is the subject of the violation has been stabilized. The department is also authorized to promulgate rules establishing criteria for a postponement of the time to correct for a longer period of time where such postponement is requested because of one or more substantial capital improvements will be made that will, when completed, significantly reduce the presence of lead-based paint in such multiple dwelling or dwelling unit including, but not limited to, a requirement that the paint which is the subject of the violation is stabilized. The department shall provide to the owner and the occupant a written statement signed and dated by the person making such decision setting forth the reasons for each postponement of the date by which a violation shall be corrected or the reason for the denial of such application for a postponement. Said written statement shall be part of the records of the department.

   (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the notice of violation shall direct that the correction of each violation cited therein shall be certified to the department. Such certification shall be made in writing, under oath by the registered owner, a registered officer or director of a corporate owner or by the registered managing agent. Such certification shall include a statement that the violation was corrected in compliance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code and shall include a copy of the lead-contaminated dust clearance test results. All certifications shall be delivered to the department and acknowledgment of receipt therefor obtained or shall be mailed to the department by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, no later than five days after the date set for correction, and shall include the date when each violation was corrected. Such certification of correction shall be supported by a sworn statement by the person who performed the work if performed by an employee or agent of the owner. A copy of such certification shall be mailed to the complainant by the department not more than twelve full calendar days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department. Failure to file such certification shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected.

   (3) Whenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a violation of section 27-2056.6 of article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, the department shall within fourteen days after the date set for the correction of such violation conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected. Where, upon conducting an inspection, the department determines that a violation has not been corrected, the department shall correct such violation within forty-five additional days of such inspection or in such shorter time as is practicable.

   (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall not remove a violation from its records nor shall it be deemed that such violation has been corrected unless the records of the department contain written verification that the department has conducted a final inspection of the premises and that such inspection verifies that the violation has been corrected, and copies of lead-contaminated dust clearance test results whenever such tests are required by applicable law, rule or regulation. A copy of the report of the final inspection of a dwelling unit and the status of the violation shall be mailed or delivered to the occupant and the owner.

   (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person making a false certification of correction of a violation issued pursuant to article 14 of subchapter 2 of this chapter, in addition to any other civil penalty, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than three thousand dollars for each false certification made, recoverable by the department in a civil action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the person making such false certification is an employee of the owner then such owner shall be responsible for such civil penalty. In addition, any such person making a false certification of correction shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars or imprisonment for up to one year or both.

   (6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person who violates article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter by failing to correct such violation in accordance with paragraph one of subdivision a of section 27-2056.11 of this code shall be subject to a civil penalty of two hundred fifty dollars per day for each violation to a maximum of ten thousand dollars from the initial date set for correction in the notice of violation until the date the violation is corrected and certified to the department, and in addition to any civil penalty shall, whenever appropriate, be punished under the provisions of article three of subchapter five of this code. There shall be a presumption that the condition constituting a violation continues after the service of the notice of violation. The owner shall be responsible for the correction of all violations noticed pursuant to article fourteen of subchapter two of this chapter, but in an action for civil penalties pursuant to this subdivision may in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties show:

      (i) That the condition which constitutes the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed; or

      (ii) That he or she began to correct the condition which constitutes the violation promptly upon discovering it but that full correction could not be completed expeditiously because of serious technical difficulties, inability to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor, or inability to gain access to the dwelling unit wherein the violation exists, or such other portion of the building as might be necessary to make the repair, provided that a postponement was granted pursuant to this subdivision; or

      (iii) That he or she was unable to obtain a permit or license necessary to correct the violation, provided that diligent and prompt application was made therefor; or

      (iv) That the violation giving rise to the action was caused by the act of negligence, neglect or abuse of another not in the employ or subject to the direction of the owner, except that the owner shall be precluded from showing in defense or mitigation of such owner's liability for civil penalties evidence of any acts occurring, undertaken, or performed by any predecessor in title prior to the owner taking control of the premises. Where the aforesaid allegations are made by way of mitigation of penalties, the owner shall show, by competent proof, pertinent financial data and efforts made to obtain necessary materials, funds or labor or to gain access, or to obtain a permit or license and such other evidence as the court may require.

      If the court finds that sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, it may remit all or part of any penalties arising from the violations, but may condition such remission upon a correction of the violation within a time period fixed by the court.

   (7) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, failure by the department to comply with any time period provided in this section relating to responsibilities of the department shall not render null and void any notice of violation issued by the department or the department of health and mental hygiene pursuant to such article or section, and shall not provide a basis for defense or mitigation of an owner's liability for civil penalties for violation of such article.

(m) (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a violation of subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this code shall be a class c immediately hazardous violation and a penalty shall be imposed in accordance with this section, provided, however, that such violation shall not be deemed a continuing class c violation of record beyond the time that the conduct constituting such violation occurred.

   (2) If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that conduct in violation of subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter has occurred, it may determine that a class c violation existed at the time that such conduct occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such court may also issue an order restraining the owner of the property from violating such subdivision and direct the owner to ensure that no further violation occurs, in accordance with section 27-2121 of this chapter. Such court shall impose a civil penalty in an amount not less than two thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars for each dwelling unit in which a tenant or any person lawfully entitled to occupancy of such unit has been the subject of such violation, and such other relief as the court deems appropriate, provided that where a petitioner establishes that there was a previous finding of a violation of subdivision d of section 27-2005 against such owner and such finding was made (i) within the preceding five year period and (ii) on or after the effective date of the local law that added this clause, such court shall impose a civil penalty in an amount not less than four thousand dollars and not more than ten thousand dollars. It shall be an affirmative defense to an allegation by a tenant of the kind described in subparagraphs b, c and g of paragraph forty-eight of subdivision a of section 27-2004 of this chapter that (i) such condition or service interruption was not intended to cause any lawful occupant to vacate a dwelling unit or waive or surrender any rights in relation to such occupancy, and (ii) the owner acted in good faith in a reasonable manner to promptly correct such condition or service interruption, including providing notice to all affected lawful occupants of such efforts, where appropriate.

   (3) An owner may seek an order by the court enjoining a tenant from initiating any further judicial proceedings against such owner pursuant to this section claiming harassment without prior leave of the court if (i) within a ten-year period such tenant has initiated two judicial proceedings pursuant to this section against such owner claiming harassment that have been dismissed on the merits and (ii) a third or subsequent proceeding initiated by such tenant against such owner pursuant to this section claiming harassment during such ten-year period is determined at the time of its adjudication to be frivolous. Except for an order on consent such order may be sought by such owner simultaneously with the adjudication of such third or subsequent judicial proceeding.

   (4) Where the court determines that a claim of harassment by a tenant against an owner is so lacking in merit as to be frivolous, the court may award attorneys fees to such owner in an amount to be determined by the court.

   (5) Nothing in paragraphs three or four of this subdivision shall be construed to affect or limit any other claims or rights of the parties.

   (6) After a court of competent jurisdiction has issued a finding that conduct in violation of subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter has occurred, the department, if it receives notice of such finding, shall post on its website, no later than ninety days after having received notice of such finding, the following information for each such finding: (i) the address of the building containing the dwelling unit that was the subject of such violation; (ii) the name of the property owner; (iii) the civil penalty imposed for such violation; (iv) the date such penalty was imposed; and (v) whether an order restraining the owner of such unit from violating subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter was issued.

(n) The provisions of subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter, subdivision m of this section and subdivision b of section 27-2120 of this chapter shall not apply where a shareholder of record on a proprietary lease for a dwelling unit, the owner of record of a dwelling unit owned as a condominium, or those lawfully entitled to reside with such shareholder or record owner, resides in the dwelling unit for which the proprietary lease authorizes residency or in such condominium unit, as is applicable.

(o)*   In any action brought by a lawful occupant or group of lawful occupants under subdivision h of this section for a violation of subdivision d of section 27-2005 of this chapter, the housing part shall, in addition to any other relief such court determines to be appropriate, award to each such occupant (i) compensatory damages or, at the election of such occupant, one thousand dollars and (ii) reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs. Such court may also, at its sole discretion, award punitive damages.

* Editor's note: there are two subdivisions designates as (o) in this section.

(o)*   (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when the department serves a notice of violation to correct and certify a condition that constitutes a violation of article four of subchapter two of this chapter, the notice of violation shall specify the date by which the violation shall be corrected as provided in such article, and the procedure by which the owner, for good cause shown pursuant to this subdivision, may request a postponement. The notice of violation shall further specify that the violation shall be corrected in accordance with section 27-2017.8 and the rules established pursuant to section 27-2017.9, where applicable.

Such certification shall include a statement that the violation was corrected in compliance with section 27-2017.8, where applicable, and the rules established pursuant to section 27-2017.9, where applicable.

Notification of such certification shall be mailed to the complainant by the department not more than twelve full calendar days from the date of receipt of such certification by the department. Failure to file such certification shall establish a prima facie case that such violation has not been corrected.

   (3) Whenever the department shall issue a notice of violation to correct a condition that constitutes a hazardous or immediately hazardous violation of subdivision a of section 27-2017.3 the department shall conduct a final inspection to verify that the violation has been corrected.

*§ 27-2123 Court order of access to inspect premises.* ::


a. A judge of any civil court of competent jurisdiction may, upon appropriate application by the department supported by an affidavit or affirmation, issue an order directing that access be provided to an officer or inspector of the department to any premises or part thereof, whenever an inspection of any premises or part thereof is required or authorized by any state or local law or regulation or entry to such area is necessary for correction of a condition violating such law or regulation.

b. If the application is found appropriate, the court may issue an order to show cause why the order of access should not be issued. If the respondent cannot with due diligence be served personally within the time fixed in such order, service may be made on such person by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place in the premises to which access is sought and by sending a copy thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, to such person at his or her last known address.

Such person shall not be in contempt of court or be required to pay a fine if he or she establishes good and sufficient reason for a failure to be present when access was demanded.

f. Nothing herein shall be deemed to authorize an officer or inspector of the department to enter any premises or part thereof if a person to whom an order is directed does not provide or refuses access.

g. Nothing herein shall affect the validity of inspections authorized and conducted under any other provision of law, rule or regulation without the issuance of an inspection warrant as provided in this article.

Such order shall direct the department to apply the security to the expenses incurred in the execution of the repair order. In the event that such security should exceed the amount required to remove or remedy such violations, such order shall direct the department to file with the court, upon completion of the work prescribed therein, a full accounting of the amount of such security and the expenditures made pursuant to such order, and to turn over such surplus to the person who posted such security, together with a copy of such accounting.






*§ 27-2128 Recovery of expenses.* ::

Service shall be deemed complete on filing proof thereof in the office of the clerk of the court in which application for such order is made.






*§ 27-2133 Temporary appointment of receiver.* ::


a. If the condition of the premises is such that unless immediately cured irreparable damage may be caused to the building or it constitutes an imminent danger to its occupants or the occupants of adjoining properties, then the order to show cause may be returnable in the discretion of the court in less than five days, and in such case, service may be made by posting a copy of the order in a conspicuous place on the premises and by mailing a copy to the owner at the address registered with the department and to the mortgagees and lienors at their respective addresses. But any appointment of a receiver without service pursuant to subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this article shall be temporary only and expire not more than thirty days thereafter unless, prior to the expiration of the thirty days, the department shall serve notice on the owner, mortgagee and lienors in the manner provided for in subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this article of intention to apply to the court at a date fixed in such notice and not less than five days after the service of such notice, for an extension of the receivership.

For such specific purpose the receiver shall be entitled to let such contracts and undertake such expenses as may be necesssary to accomplish the specific results without advertisements and without procuring competitive bids.






*§ 27-2134 Proceedings on return of order to show cause.* ::


a. On the return of the order to show cause, determination thereof shall have precedence over every other business of the court unless the court shall find that some other pending proceeding, having a similar statutory preference, has priority.

b. If the court finds that the facts stated in the application warrant the granting thereof, then it shall appoint the commissioner of housing preservation and development receiver of the rents, issues and profits of the property.

c. Notwithstanding subdivision b of this section, if, after determination of the issue, the owner, or any mortgagee or lienor or other person having an interest in the property, shall apply to the court to be permitted to remove or remedy the conditions set forth in the department's application and shall (1) demonstrate the ability promptly to undertake the work required; and (2) post security for the performance thereof within the time, and in the amount and manner, deemed necessary by the court, then the court may in lieu of appointing a receiver issue an order permitting such person to perform the work within a time fixed by the court. If at the time fixed in the order the work has not been satisfactorily done, the court shall appoint such receiver. If after the granting of an order permitting a person to perform the work but before the time fixed by the court for the completion thereof it shall appear to the department that the person permitted to do the same is not proceeding with due diligence, then the department may apply to the court, on notice to those persons who have appeared in the proceeding, for a hearing to determine whether a receiver shall be appointed immediately. On the failure of any person to complete the work in accordance with the provisions of an order under this subdivision, the department, or any receiver thereafter appointed shall be reimbursed for costs incurred by him or her in removing or remedying the condition and other charges herein provided for out of the security posted by such person.






*§ 27-2135 Powers and duties of receiver.* ::


a. A receiver appointed pursuant to this article shall have all of the powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property, together with such additional powers and duties as herein granted and imposed. Such receiver shall not be required to file any bond.

b. The receiver shall with all reasonable speed remove violations in the dwelling and its premises, including those constituting a fire hazard or a threat to life, health or safety. He or she may also, in addition to ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacement, make other improvements to effect a rehabilitation of the property, in such fashion as is consistent with maintaining safe and habitable conditions over the remaining useful life of the dwelling. He or she shall have the power to let contracts or incur expenses therefor in accordance with the provisions of law applicable to contracts for public works except that advertisement shall not be required for each such contract. Notwithstanding any provision of law, the receiver may let contracts or incur expenses for individual items of repairs, improvements or supplies without the procurement of competitive bids where the total amount of any such individual item does not exceed twenty-five hundred dollars.

c. The receiver shall collect the accrued and accruing rents, issues and profits of the dwelling and apply the same to the cost of the repairs and improvements authorized in subdivision (b) of this section, to the payment of expenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of the property, including insurance and the fees of the managing agent, and the necessary expenses of his or her office as receiver, the repayment of all moneys advanced to the receiver by the department of housing preservation and development to cover the costs incurred by the receiver and interest thereon; and then, if there be a surplus, to unpaid taxes, assessments, water rents, sewer rents and penalties and interest thereon, and then to sums due to mortgagees or lienors. If the income of the property shall be insufficient to cover the cost of the repairs and improvements or the expenses reasonably necessary to the proper operation and management of the property and other necessary expenses of the receiver, the department of housing preservation and development shall advance to the receiver any sums required to cover such cost and expense and thereupon shall have a lien against the property having the priority provided in article eight of this subchapter for any such sums so advanced with interest thereon.

d. The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages. Such fees and commissions shall be paid into the fund created pursuant to section 27-2111 of article one of this subchapter. The receiver shall be liable only in his or her official capacity for injury to person and property by reason of conditions of the premises in a case where an owner would have been liable; such receiver shall not have any liability in his or her personal capacity. The personnel and facilities of the department of housing preservation and development and the corporation counsel shall be availed of by the receiver for the purpose of carrying out his or her duties as receiver, and the costs of such services shall be deemed a necessary expense of the receiver.






*§ 27-2136 Discharge of receiver.* ::


The receiver shall be discharged upon rendering a full and complete accounting to the court when the repairs and improvements herein authorized are completed and the cost thereof and all other costs authorized herein have been paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling and the surplus money, if any, has been paid over to the owner or the mortgagee or lienor as the court may direct. However, at any time, the receiver may be discharged upon filing his or her account as receiver without affecting the right of the department of housing preservation and development to its lien. Upon the completion of the repairs and improvements, the owner, the mortgagee or any lienor may apply for the discharge of the receiver upon payment to the receiver of all moneys expended by him or her therefor and all other costs authorized by section 27-2135 of this article which have not been paid or reimbursed from the rents and income of the dwelling.






*§ 27-2137 Recovery of expenses of receivership; lien of receiver.* ::


a. The expenditures made by the receiver pursuant to section 27-2135 of this article shall, to the extent that they are not recovered from the rents and income of the property collected by the receiver, constitute a debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and lot, and upon the rents and income thereof. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the provisions of article eight of this subchapter shall govern the effect and enforcement of such debt and lien; references therein to the department shall, for purposes of this article be deemed to refer to the receiver and, after such receiver's discharge, the department of housing preservation and develop- ment.

b. Failure to serve a copy of the order and notice required in the manner specified by section 27-2131 of this article, or failure to serve any mortgagee or lienor with a copy of the order to show cause as required by subdivision c of section 27-2132 of this article, shall not affect the validity of the proceeding or the appointment of a receiver, but the rights of the department of housing preservation and development or of the receiver shall not in such event be superior to the rights of any mortgagee or lienor who has not been served as provided therein.

c. Any mortgagee or lienor who at his or her expense remedies or removes the conditions to the satisfaction of the court pursuant to the provisions of subdivision c of section 27-2134 of this article shall have and be entitled to enforce a lien equivalent to the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing preservation and development hereunder. Any mortgagee or lienor who, following the appointment of a receiver by the court, shall reimburse the receiver and the department of housing preservation and development for all costs and charges as hereinabove provided shall be entitled to an assignment of the lien granted to the receiver in favor of the department of housing preservation and development.






*§ 27-2138 Obligations of owner not affected.* ::


Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve the owner of any civil or criminal liability incurred or any duty imposed by law by reason of acts or omissions of the owner prior to the appointment of a receiver, nor shall anything contained herein be construed to suspend during the receivership any obligation of the owner for the payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance expenses of the dwelling nor of the owner or any other person for the payment of mortgages or liens.

Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties.

b. All expenses incurred by the department for the repair or the elimination of any dangerous or unlawful conditions therein, pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable provision of law, shall constitute a lien upon the premises when such charge is due and payable, which, notwithstanding any other provision of law, shall be the due and payable date for such charge provided on the second statement of account containing such charge.

b. No challenge may be made except by (1) the owner of the property, or (2) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would, but for the provisions of section 27-2144 of this article, have priority over the department's lien.

An issue specified in subdivision a which was decided, or could have been contested, in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order to repair under article five of this subchapter or to secure the appointment or the discharge of a receiver under article six of this subchapter, shall not be open to reexamination, but if any mortgagee or lienor entitled to notice of such prior proceeding was not served and did not appear therein, his or her mortgage or lien shall have priority over the lien of the department. In addition to this limitation, an owner who has been served with a statement pursuant to section 27-2129 of article five of this subchapter, or his successor in interest, may not subsequently contest the expense contained therein unless such owner or successor in interest notified the department in writing of his or her objection to the statement of account in the manner and within the time period provided in section 27-2129 of article five of this subchapter.

d. With respect to any issue specified in subdivision a which is not subject to subdivision c, the statement of the department made pursuant to section 27-2145 of this article shall be presumptive evidence of the facts stated therein.

Such payment and receipt shall for all purposes have the same legal effect as payment to or a receipt from the owner or other person authorized to collect rent. No person shall be subject to any proceedings for the recovery of possession or other relief, or any penalty or forfeiture, arising out of his or her failure to pay to any person any sum paid to the department under this section.

d. The department shall, at the time of service of any notice under subdivision a, give the owner and agent notice by certified mail at their last registered address, or other address, if known, of such action.

Any mortgagee or lienor who pays the department shall be assigned the department's lien.

b.    A receiver appointed pursuant to this section shall have all of the powers and duties of a receiver appointed in an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property. Such receiver shall not be required to file any bond.

c. The receiver shall be entitled to the same fees, commissions and necessary expenses as receivers in actions to foreclose mortgages. Such fees and commissions shall be paid into the fund created pursuant to section 27-2111 of article one of this subchapter. The receiver shall be liable only in his or her official capacity for injury to person and property by reason of conditions of the premises in a case where an owner would have been liable; such receiver shall not have any liability in his or her personal capacity.

*§ 27-2152 Enforcement.* ::


a. If the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that an owner has violated the provisions of subdivision a of section 27-2151, the commissioner shall serve a notice of violation and an order to correct such violation on the owner pursuant to sections 27-2091 and 27-2095 of this code. The order shall require the owner to comply with subdivision a of section 27-2151 in the manner specified in such order within ten days. A copy of the order shall be filed with the city register and any subsequent purchaser of the property shall be subject to such order.

b. An owner may apply within the ten day period following service of the notice and order:

   1. for the revocation of the notice of violation and order on the ground that the condition alleged to constitute the violation did not exist at the time the violation was placed. The department may grant such revocation upon the presentation of proof satisfactory to the department; or

   2. for an extension of the time for correction. The department may, upon good cause shown, including consideration of the complexity of repairs which may be necessary to make the dwelling unit habitable, grant such extension for such period of time that it deems appropriate.

c. The owner shall certify correction of the violation in accordance with subdivision f of section 27-2115 no later than five days after the date set for corrections. Such certification shall be supported by a sworn statement by the owner that the units which are the subject of notice of violation have been rented to bona fide tenants or that the owner has, in good faith, made a continuing public offer to rent such units at rents no greater than the rents authorized by law. The department may require such additional proof as it deems necessary, including but not limited to the specific units offered for rent and the rents asked therefor.

d. For the purposes of this section there shall be a rebuttable presumption that an owner has violated the provisions of subdivision a of section 27-2151 if a single room occupancy dwelling unit is not occupied by a bona fide tenant for a period of thirty days or longer.

e. 1. An owner who violates the provisions of subdivision a of section 27-2151 shall be subject to a civil penalty of five hundred dollars for each single room occupancy dwelling unit cited in the notice and order issued pursuant to subdivision a of this section.

   2. In addition to the civil penalties provided in paragraph one of this subdivision any owner who willfully makes a false certification that a violation has been corrected shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars for each dwelling unit or units which are the subject of the notice of violation. Such owner shall also be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less than two hundred fifty dollars nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment up to six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

   3. Such civil penalties may be recovered by the city in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction. A judgment obtained in such an action shall constitute a lien against the premises with respect to which the violation occurred from the time of the filing of a notice of pendency in the office of the clerk of the county in which such premises is situated. A notice of pendency may be filed at the time of the commencement of the action or at any time before final judgment or order.

f. All civil penalties recovered pursuant to subdivision e of this section shall be paid to the single room occupancy housing development fund company established pursuant to subdivision i of section 27-198.2 of the administrative code.

g. 1. The city may institute an action in a court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring the owner to comply with the order to correct or for such other relief as may be appropriate.

   2. The city may make application for the appointment of a receiver in accordance with the procedures contained in article six of this subchapter. Any receiver appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall be authorized, in addition to any other powers conferred by law, to effect compliance with the provisions of this article. Any expenditures incurred by the receiver to effect such compliance shall constitute a debt of the owner and a lien upon the building and lot, and upon the rents and income thereof, in accordance with the procedures contained in such article six. The city in its discretion may provide funds to be expended by the receiver, and such funds shall constitute a debt recoverable from the owner in accordance with article eight of this subchapter.

h. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this article and other provisions of this code the provisions of this article shall control.







**Article 10: Alternative Enforcement Program**



*§ 27-2153 Alternative Enforcement Program.* ::


The department shall establish an alternative enforcement program and identify distressed buildings for participation in such program. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the department shall enforce violations of this code and the multiple dwelling law pursuant to such program, as follows:

a. The department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different distressed buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program in each of the first two years of such program. For purposes of this subdivision the criteria used to identify distressed buildings shall be:

   (i) twenty-seven or more open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of record which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to identification of the building for such program; and

   (ii) a ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to identification of the building for such program that equal in the aggregate five or more such violations for every dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling; and

   (iii) unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, in a ratio of one hundred or more dollars for each dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling which were incurred within the two-year period prior to identification of the building for such program.

b. In the third year of such program the department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different distressed buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program. The criteria used to identify distressed buildings in such year shall be:

   (i) twenty-five or more open hazardous or immediately hazardous violations which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to identification of the building for such program; and

   (ii) a ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to such identification that equal in the aggregate five or more such violations for every dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling; and

   (iii) unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, in a ratio of one hundred or more dollars for each dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling which were incurred within the two-year period prior to such iden- tification.

c. (1)    In the fourth year and each succeeding year of such program the department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different distressed buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program. The criteria used to identify distressed buildings in such years shall be:

      (i) in a multiple dwelling that contains not less than three and not more than nineteen units, a ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to such identification that equals in the aggregate five or more such violations for every dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling, and in a multiple dwelling that contains not less than twenty units, a ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations which were issued by the department within the two-year period prior to such identification that equals in the aggregate three or more such violations for every dwelling unit in the multiple dwelling; and

      (ii) paid and unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, which were incurred within the two-year period prior to such identification, of two thousand five hundred or more dollars in a multiple dwelling that contains not less than three and not more than nineteen units, and paid and unpaid emergency repair charges, including liens, which were incurred within the two-year period prior to such identification, of five thousand or more dollars in a multiple dwelling that contains twenty or more units.

   (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, in the sixth year of such program, and for each succeeding year, the department shall identify no fewer than two hundred different distressed buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program and may by rule revise criteria related to the ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations per dwelling unit and the amount or ratio per dwelling unit of paid and unpaid emergency repair charges which must exist for a building to qualify for participation in the program.

   (3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, in the ninth year of such program, and for each succeeding year, the department shall identify no fewer than two hundred fifty different distressed buildings for participation in the alternative enforcement program and may by rule set criteria for such buildings to participate in the program, which may include, but need not be limited to: the ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations per dwelling unit, the amount or ratio per dwelling unit of paid or unpaid emergency repair charges and the number of dwelling units that must exist for a building to qualify for participation in the program. The department may by rule add to the criteria set forth in subdivision e of this section relating to which buildings are to be excluded from the program.

d. For the purposes of subdivisions a and b of this section, those buildings having the highest aggregate ratio of open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations for every dwelling unit shall be the buildings identified first for participation in the program. For the purposes of paragraph one of subdivision c of this section, those buildings having the highest amount of paid and unpaid emergency repair charges and liens incurred within the two-year period prior to identification shall be the buildings identified first for participation in the program. For the purposes of paragraphs two and three of subdivision c of this section, the department shall by rule determine the criteria for which buildings shall be identified first for participation in the program.

e. (1)    Notwithstanding the criteria set forth in subdivisions a, b, and c of this section, a building that is currently the subject of an in rem foreclosure action by the city, or that was the subject of an in rem foreclosure judgment in favor of the city and that was transferred by the city to a third party pursuant to section 11-412.1 of the code within the prior five years, or that is currently the subject of a court order appointing or a proceeding brought by the department seeking the appointment of an administrator pursuant to article 7-A of the real property actions and proceedings law, shall not be included in the alternative enforcement program.

   (2) Notwithstanding the criteria set forth in subdivisions a, b, and c of this section, a multiple dwelling that is the subject of a loan provided by or through the department or the New York city housing development corporation for the purpose of rehabilitation, as provided in rules of the department, and that has closed within the past two years, shall not be included in the alternative enforcement program, provided further, that a multiple dwelling that has been included in the alternative enforcement program and becomes the subject of such a loan that closes within the first four months after the building has been included in the alternative enforcement program, shall be discharged from such program.

f. Where there are fewer than two hundred fifty buildings that meet the applicable criteria, the department shall by rule determine the criteria for additional buildings to participate in the alternative enforcement program.

g. (1) The department shall within thirty days of identifying a distressed building for participation in the alternative enforcement program provide written notification to the owner of such building, the occupants of such building and the council member in whose district the building is located, that such building is subject to the requirements of such program and the requirements of this article. Such written notification shall inform such owner of his or her duty to post the notice required by paragraph two of this subdivision and that such owner shall be liable for a civil penalty for failure to comply. The department shall simultaneously provide to such owner information about correcting violations related to mold and vermin, when such violations are applicable to such multiple dwelling, as set forth in paragraphs ii and iii of subdivision i of this section.

   (2) Within fifteen days after receiving notice from the department in accordance with paragraph one of this subdivision, or such later date as the department may specify in such notice, the owner of a building identified for participation in the alternative enforcement program shall post a sign on the building's main entrance door, or in another conspicuous location in the common area of the building, stating (i) that the building has been placed in the alternative enforcement program, (ii) that occupants may call 311 or the program's direct line to make complaints about the conditions in their units or in the common areas, (iii) the name, telephone number and address of the owner and (iv) the identity of the financial institution that holds the mortgage on the property, if any. Such sign shall be in English, Spanish and in any other language the department may require by rule. Upon request of a tenant occupying a dwelling unit in the building, the owner shall make best efforts to provide the sign in a language other than English or Spanish. The owner shall maintain such sign until he or she receives written notice from the department that the building has been discharged from the alternative enforcement program. An owner who fails to comply with the requirement to post and maintain a sign pursuant to this subdivision shall be liable for a penalty of two hundred fifty dollars.

h. The department shall establish a process to provide the occupants of buildings participating in the alternative enforcement program and council members within whose districts such buildings are located with information regarding the status of the building during participation in such program.

i. (i)    The owner of a building that is identified for participation in the alternative enforcement program shall be required to respond in writing to the notification provided pursuant to subdivision g of this section whether he or she intends to correct the existing violations of this code and the multiple dwelling law in such building. Such owner shall correct the existing violations of this code and the multiple dwelling law in such building no later than four months after written notification by the department pursuant to subdivision g of this section, provided, however, that the original correction date for any violation issued in such building shall not be deemed to be changed or postponed by such notification. Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the department from determining after such identification that the provisions of subdivision k may be immediately implemented. Where such owner believes that such violations have been corrected, such owner shall request a reinspection of such violations for dismissal by the department. The process to request a reinspection and dismissal of such violations shall be prescribed in rules promulgated by the department. The department shall perform a reinspection within sixty days of receipt of a request for such reinspection by the owner and upon completion of such reinspection the department shall assess whether such owner has substantially complied with the requirements of this subdivision. The department shall issue a notice of violation for any new violation observed in the course of such reinspection. After completion of such reinspection, the department shall within twenty days provide a written determination to such owner. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantial compliance" shall mean that at the time of reinspection by the department, all violations relating directly to providing heat and hot water and all immediately hazardous violations related to mold, eighty percent of all hazardous violations related to mold, eighty percent of all vermin violations and eighty percent of all other open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations have been determined by the department to have been corrected. A violation relating to mold shall only be deemed corrected if the violation has been corrected in accordance with paragraph ii of this subdivision and a violation relating to vermin shall only be deemed corrected if such violation has been corrected in accordance with paragraph iii of this subdivision.

   (ii) With respect to mold violations, the owner of a building participating in the alternative enforcement program shall correct such violations by investigating and correcting identified moisture problems prior to or as part of the mold removal work; informing building occupants about commencement of mold removal work; providing building occupants with a copy of the department of health and mental hygiene's brochure about mold and requiring, to the extent practicable, occupants to leave the work area before work begins; removing, or securely covering with plastic sheeting, any difficult-to-clean surfaces or items in the immediate work area before mold removal work begins; ensuring that all mold removal work is done in a manner that minimizes the dispersion of dust and debris from the work area into other parts of the dwelling; removing and throwing away porous materials that contain mold growth and that cannot be cleaned, or materials that are saturated with water and that cannot be dried; discarding any plastic sheeting, materials with mold growth, and used sponges, mop heads and cleaning wipe cloths in sealed heavy-duty plastic bags; cleaning any remaining visible dust from the mold removal work using wet cleaning methods or by HEPA-vacuuming and cleaning mold growth with soap or detergent and water, not bleach or other biocide solutions. When such mold removal work has been completed, such owner shall document all corrective actions taken for identifying and repairing moisture sources and mold removal work methods that were used, inform occupants of the building that if mold growth or moisture recurs they should inform the building owner, and shall provide a certification to the department that such actions have been taken.

   (iii) With respect to vermin violations, the owner of a building participating in the alternative enforcement program shall correct such violations by eliminating conditions conducive to vermin infestation, including but not limited to, areas allowing access to vermin, leaking plumbing, and uncontained garbage and debris, and eliminating sources of water and food for pests. Owners shall inform building occupants about the commencement of pest management treatment and provide occupants with a copy of the department of health and mental hygiene's brochure on controlling pests safely. Owners shall request that occupants support the pest management treatment by preparing the kitchen, bathroom and other areas as needed and that occupants be available to listen to advice on how to maintain pest-free conditions, including clean up, food storage, management of garbage, and selection of safer pest control products. Such owner shall also address such violations by utilizing pesticide applications or devices as permitted by state and federal law. No person may perform pesticide applications unless that person is a certified applicator pursuant to article 33 of the environmental conservation law or is supervised by a certified applicator. An owner shall caulk and seal small holes less than four inches in diameter, cracks and crevices in or in between walls, cabinets, floors, and in other locations where vermin may gain access. A HEPA-vacuum shall be utilized in kitchens and bathrooms, including in cracks, crevices and appliances in such rooms. When such pest management work has been completed, such owner shall document all corrective actions taken to address vermin violations including work methods and products used, provide information to occupants of the building about ways to control pests safely, inform building occupants that they should report recurrent or persistent pest problems to the owner, and provide a certification to the department that such actions have been taken. In addition, for a multiple dwelling in which vermin infestation is indicated the owner of such multiple dwelling shall submit a pest management plan indicating continuing pest control measures to the department of health and mental hygiene for approval which must be approved by such department prior to the discharge of such building from the program.

j. (i)    Where an owner has received a written determination by the department that he or she has substantially complied with the requirements of subdivision i of this section, such owner shall pay to the department all outstanding charges, including liens, for emergency repair work performed by the department in such building that are due, if any, or shall enter into an agreement with the department of finance to pay such charges and liens, and shall register the building in accordance with article two of subchapter four of chapter two of this title if the building is not validly registered. Upon such payment, or execution of such an agreement, and valid registration, where applicable, the department shall notify the owner, the occupants in such building and the council member in whose district such building is located that the building has been discharged from participation in the alternative enforcement program, provided, however, that the department shall continue to monitor the building to ensure continued compliance with this code. Such monitoring shall be performed not less often than every three months for a period of at least one year with special consideration given to any uncorrected immediately hazardous violations.

   (ii) Except as provided in subdivision l of this section, the failure by an owner to substantially comply with the provisions of subdivision i of this section, or pay all outstanding charges, including liens, for emergency repair work, if any, or enter into an agreement with the department of finance to pay such charges and liens, or validly register the building in accordance with article two of subchapter four of chapter two of this title, where applicable, shall result in the building remaining in the alternative enforcement program, and such building shall continue to be subject to the fees and other requirements applicable to such program. Upon such failure, the department shall notify such owner that the building has not been discharged from the alternative enforcement program.

k. (i)    The department shall perform a building-wide inspection of a building that is subject to the requirements of the alternative enforcement program if: (1) the owner has been notified that such building has not been discharged from the program pursuant to subdivision i of this section, or (2) the owner has failed to respond to written notification by the department in accordance with subdivision g of this section. Such building-wide inspection shall be commenced no later than thirty days after notice is given to the owner pursuant to paragraph ii of subdivision j of this section. After such building-wide inspection is completed, the department shall issue an order to such owner to correct existing violations of this code and the multiple dwelling law and any new violations written since the notification of the owner in accordance with subdivision g of this section and repair the related underlying conditions as shall be specified in such order, provided, however, that if such inspection does not indicate that any building systems must be repaired or replaced, the order may be limited to requiring the owner to correct violations of this code and the multiple dwelling law and any physical defects. Such building-wide inspection shall be completed and such order issued within ninety days of commencement of the building-wide inspection. Such order shall be filed in the office of the county clerk in the county in which the building is located. For purposes of this article, a "related underlying condition" shall mean a physical defect or failure of a building system that is causing or has caused a violation, such as, but not limited to, a structural defect, or failure of a heating or plumbing system.

   (ii) The department shall: (1) within thirty days of the filing of such order prepare a scope of work necessary to correct the violations and repair the related underlying conditions as are specified in such order; (2) cause repair work to be commenced and expeditiously completed unless there are circumstances beyond the control of the department such as: the inability to obtain access to the building or any part thereof necessary for the making of such repairs in which case the repairs related to the portion of the building to which access could not be obtained may be delayed until access is obtained; or the inability to obtain necessary legal approvals, materials or labor; or there is ongoing litigation with respect to the building that prevents such work from being performed by the department; or the owner undertakes the repair work in a manner that is satisfactory to the department; or commencement or completion of the work is not practicable because a vacate or similar order has been issued by the department or any city agency and/or the cost of performing work necessary for restoring the building pursuant to the order is economically infeasible; and (3) monitor repair work as it is performed in accordance with subdivision m of this section. For the purposes of this subdivision, "economically infeasible" shall mean a determination by the department that the cost of repairing a particular building exceeds the anticipated market value of such building after all repairs have been completed. However, any determination by the department that, for the purposes of this subdivision, repairs to a particular building would be economically infeasible for the department to undertake, shall not take into consideration the owner's conduct with respect to the building.

   (iii) When the department causes repair work to be commenced in accordance with paragraph ii of this subdivision, in a multiple dwelling in which vermin infestation is indicated, vermin violations shall be corrected in accordance with paragraph iii of subdivision i of this section. The department shall also require the owner of such multiple dwelling to submit to the department of health and mental hygiene for their approval a pest management plan indicating continuing pest control measures. Such plan must be approved by the department of health and mental hygiene prior to the discharge of such building from the program.

l. The owner or managing agent or other designated representative of a building which is the subject of an order by the department pursuant to subdivision k of this section may be required to participate in a course of training relating to building operation and maintenance, approved by the department.

m. The department shall reassess, at quarterly intervals, or more often as necessary, each building that has been identified for participation in the alternative enforcement program for which the department has issued an order pursuant to subdivision k of this section and in which the department or an owner has commenced repairs, to ensure progress towards completion of such repairs. At each such reassessment the department shall determine whether repairs are progressing in a timely fashion. When conducting such reassessment the department shall give special consideration to the correction of immediately hazardous violations. No later than six months from the commencement of such repair work, if the department determines that such repair work is not progressing in a timely fashion, then the department shall expeditiously complete the repairs.

n. The department may discharge from the alternative enforcement program a building for which an order has been issued pursuant to subdivision k of this section upon: (1) substantial compliance, (2) payment of fees, (3) payment to the department of all outstanding emergency repair charges, including liens, or entry into an agreement with the department of finance to pay such charges and liens, and (4) registration of such building in accordance with article two of subchapter four of chapter two of this title or such other criteria as may be established by rule which are not inconsistent with any of the provisions of this article as are applicable. The department may also discharge from the alternative enforcement program any building for which an administrator is appointed pursuant to article 7-A of the real property actions and proceedings law during the time period that such building is participating in the program; any building that is vacant for one year or more except for any building that contains six or more units and is the subject of a vacate order; any building that becomes the subject of an in rem foreclosure judgment in favor of the city and that is transferred by the city to a third party pursuant to section 11-412.1 of the code; and any building in which the department has completed the work it is required to perform pursuant to subdivision k of this section. Where the department determines to discharge a building from such program, it shall provide a written determination to the owner, the occupants of such building and the council member in whose district such building is located and shall file in the office of the county clerk in the county in which such building is located, a rescission of the order issued pursuant to subdivision k of this section, where such order has been issued. For the purposes of this subdivision, "substantial compliance" shall mean that at the time of reinspection by the department, all violations relating directly to providing heat and hot water and all immediately hazardous violations related to mold, eighty percent of all hazardous violations related to mold, eighty percent of all vermin violations and eighty percent of all other open hazardous and immediately hazardous violations and the related underlying conditions, have been determined by the department to have been corrected. A violation relating to mold shall only be deemed corrected if the violation has been corrected in accordance with paragraph ii of subdivision i of this section and a violation relating to vermin shall only be deemed corrected if such violation has been corrected in accordance with paragraph iii of subdivision i of this section and, when applicable, paragraph iii of subdivision k of this section.

o. The department shall expeditiously undertake good faith efforts to obtain access to any portion of the building where access is necessary in order to perform an inspection, perform work to correct a violation of this code or the multiple dwelling law or perform work to repair a related underlying condition. If access is not obtained even after such good faith efforts, the department shall seek an order of access in accordance with the provisions of section 27-2123 of this code.

      (ii) Except as otherwise provided by rule, a master electrician business whether in the form of a corporation, a partnership or a sole proprietorship, may continue to engage in the business of performing electrical work only so long as the responsible representative of such business identified on the application for approval of the master electrician business remains an officer of such corporation, a partner of such partnership or the proprietor of such sole proprietorship unless the department approves a change in the responsible representative as provided in this section. The commissioner may promulgate rules providing for the continuation of a master electrician business pending the approval of a new responsible representative.

      (iii) Except as otherwise provided in such rules, the revocation, suspension, license deactivation or non-renewal of the master electrician's license of the responsible representative of a master electrician business automatically revokes its approval to do business and cancels any delegation of authority given by such responsible representative to another master electrician associated with such business pending the approval by the department of a new responsible representative.

   3. Except as otherwise provided by rule, a master electrician business shall not change its name, form or designate a new responsible representative without the prior approval of the license board. Approval of an application for a change is conditional upon the following: filing the necessary forms, payment of the prescribed fee and full payment of all fees incurred with respect to such business prior to the date of the change. Except as otherwise provided by rule, a requested change shall not be approved if there are any outstanding fees related to the licensee's or master electrician business's professional dealings due and owing to the department or outstanding violation notices attributable to the licensee or the master electrician business.

   4. A master electrician's license and a special electrician's license and seal shall not be held by any person at the same time.

   6. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent two or more master electrician businesses from entering into a joint venture of limited duration for a particular project in accordance with the rules of the department. An application for a permit involving a joint venture shall so indicate on the application and shall identify all of the master electrician businesses that are parties to such joint venture by name and authorization number and the names and license numbers of the responsible representatives of such businesses. The application shall be signed by the responsible representative of one of the parties to the joint venture on behalf of all such parties and all of such parties shall be jointly and severally liable for any fees due with respect to electrical work performed by such joint venture and for violations of this chapter and the rules of the department arising out of such work.

   4. The commissioner may promulgate rules requiring applicants for the renewal of master or special electrician's licenses to submit proof, in such form as he or she shall determine, that, in each year of the license term, such applicant completed at least eight hours of continuing education courses approved by the department. Such proof shall be submitted with the license renewal application.

b. If a master electrician's or special electrician's license is suspended for cause, and the restoration thereof is conditional upon some action to be taken by the holder of the master electrician's or special electrician's license and the holder fails to take action before the expiration of the license, such failure shall be cause for the denial of the subsequent application to renew the license and seal.






*§ 27-3016 Suspension, revocation or deactivation of master electrician's and special electrician's licenses and suspension or revocation of approval of master electrician business.* ::


a. 1. After notice and the opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the rules of the department, master electrician's or special electrician's licenses and/or approvals of master electrician businesses may be suspended or revoked by the commissioner and/or the commissioner may impose penalties, which shall not exceed five thousand dollars for each violation, for violation of this chapter or of any of the rules of the department and/or the commissioner may order the licensee to cause the repair of electrical damage, and any damage incidental thereto, resulting from any act or omission giving rise to a violation as set forth in this chapter or in rules, for any of the following:
