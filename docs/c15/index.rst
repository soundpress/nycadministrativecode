*§ 16-131.2 Additional powers of the commissioner.* ::


In addition to any other enforcement procedures authorized by law, the commissioner shall have the powers described in this section.

a. The commissioner may order any person violating section 16-130 or 16-131 of this chapter or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city health code to discontinue such violation immediately.

b. 1. If the commissioner finds that premises for which a permit is required pursuant to section 16-130 of this chapter are being used either without such permit or in a manner which poses an imminent threat to the public health or safety, then the commissioner may order in writing that (a) such premises be sealed, secured and closed and/or (b) that equipment, vehicles or other personal property used on such premises be removed or sealed and secured. Upon the effective date of such order, no person shall have access to such premises and/or use such equipment except as authorized by the commissioner. Upon such effective date, authorized officers and employees of the department, the department of health and mental hygiene and the New York city police department shall act upon and enforce such order. The finding whether an imminent threat to the public health or safety exists shall be based on factors that include but are not limited to: (i) the quantity of solid waste, or of material listed in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may pose a threat; (ii) the types of solid waste, or of such material listed in such subparagraph, that may pose a threat; and/or (iii) the risk of harm to the public or the environment. For the purpose of this paragraph: "sealed, secured and closed" or "sealed and secured" shall mean the use of any means available to render the premises or any part thereof, and/or any equipment, vehicles or other personal property contained therein, inaccessible or inoperable, including but not limited to the use of a padlock or cinder blocks.

   2. Any equipment, vehicles or other personal property removed pursuant to an order issued under paragraph one of this subdivision may be stored in a garage, pound or other place of safety, and the owner or other person lawfully entitled to the possession of such equipment, vehicles or other personal property may be charged with the reasonable costs for removal and storage, payable prior to the release of such equipment, vehicles or other personal property. Equipment, vehicles or other personal property not reclaimed by such owner or other person within ninety days of the notification to such owner or other person that such order has been rescinded shall be deemed abandoned and may be disposed of by the department at a public auction, provided that vehicles deemed abandoned shall be disposed of in a manner consistent with section twelve hundred twenty-four of the vehicle and traffic law and that timely notice of any public auction shall be provided to any record holder of a security interest at the address for such holder set forth in any instrument recorded in the city of New York.

   3. Any order to seal, secure and close premises pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, or to remove or seal and secure equipment, vehicles or other personal property issued pursuant to such paragraph, shall contain notice of the right to request a hearing within thirty days of delivery of such order and posting of such order pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph four of this subdivision. If a hearing is requested within such thirty day period, the order shall be effective as set forth in the determination of the commissioner. If no hearing is requested within such thirty day period the order shall be effective on the thirtieth day after such delivery and posting pursuant to such sentence. A hearing held pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted by the department. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings of fact and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who shall make the final findings of fact and the final determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, if such order is based upon a finding by the commissioner of an imminent threat to the public health or safety, such order may provide that it shall be effective immediately upon posting pursuant to the first sentence of paragraph four of this subdivision; in such case a hearing shall be held within three business days of a request for such hearing and a determination shall be rendered within four business days of the conclusion of such hearing.

   4. Orders of the commissioner issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be served by delivery of the order to the permittee, owner or other person of suitable age and discretion in actual or apparent control of the premises, equipment, vehicles or other personal property, and shall be posted at the premises that have been sealed, secured and closed, or on or in the vicinity of the equipment, vehicles or other personal property that has been sealed and secured, or on the premises from which equipment, vehicles or other personal property has been removed. The commissioner shall ensure that notice is delivered and posted pursuant to this paragraph, and in addition shall ensure that such order is mailed to the permittee at the residence or business address for such permittee set forth in the records of the department, to the record owner of such premises, and any record mortgagee of such premises, at the address set forth in the recorded instrument and to the person designated as owner or agent of the premises or designated to receive real property tax or water bills for the premises at the address for such person contained in one of the files compiled by the department of finance for the purpose of the assessment or collection of real property taxes and water charges or in the file compiled by the department of finance from real property transfer forms filed with the city register upon the sale or transfer of real property, to the owner of such vehicles at the address for such owner set forth in the registration record maintained by the department of motor vehicles pursuant to section four hundred one of the vehicle and traffic law or for vehicles not registered in New York state, such equivalent record in the state of registration, and to any record holder of a security interest in equipment, vehicles or other personal property at the address for such holder set forth in any instrument recorded in the city of New York, and at the address for such holder set forth in any certificate of title issued by the department of motor vehicles pursuant to title ten of the vehicle and traffic law. In addition, such order shall be mailed to the owner of equipment or personal property, other than vehicles, at any address for such owner provided by the permittee or the person to whom such order is delivered pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.

   5. Where premises have been sealed, secured and closed or equipment, vehicles, or other personal property has been sealed and secured or removed by order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, the permittee, owner or other person lawfully entitled to the possession of the premises or equipment, vehicles or other personal property, may at any time provide to the commissioner assurances that the conditions which caused the issuance of such order have been corrected and will not reoccur and any necessary permit will be obtained. Upon receipt of such assurances, the commissioner shall within two business days either issue a written determination that such conditions have not been corrected, or are likely to reoccur, or, if such assurances are satisfactory, rescind such order; provided that no equipment, vehicles or other personal property shall be released after such rescission unless costs for removal and storage owed pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision have been paid.

   6. (a)    No person shall remove or cause to be removed the seal from, or otherwise enter without the commissioner's authorization, any premises sealed by order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision.

      (b) No person shall remove or cause to be removed the seal from, or otherwise tamper with or use, any equipment, vehicles or other personal property sealed by order of the commissioner issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision.

*§ 16-131.3 Removal or abatement of public nuisance.* ::


a. 1.    Whenever the commissioner finds that there exists, on premises required to be permitted pursuant to section 16-130 of this chapter, a condition hazardous to public health or safety, the commissioner may declare such premises to be a public nuisance and order the permittee and/or owner to remove or abate such public nuisance as such order shall specify. It shall be the duty of such permittee and/or owner upon whom such an order has been served to remove or abate such public nuisance in the manner and in the time provided by such order.

   2. For the purpose of this subdivision, the finding whether a condition hazardous to the public health or safety exists shall be based on factors that include but are not limited to: (i) the quantity of solid waste, or of material listed in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may create a condition hazardous to the public health or safety; (ii) the types of solid waste, or of such material listed in such subparagraph, that may create such a condition; and/or (iii) the risk of harm to the public or the environment.

b. 1. An order of the commissioner issued pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall specify the work to be performed and shall fix a reasonable time for compliance which shall not be less than thirty days from the date of service of such order, or twenty days after the commissioner's determination pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision, whichever is later. Such order shall contain a statement that upon the failure of the permittee and/or owner of such premises to comply with the commissioner's order within the stated time, the department may perform the work specified in the order or the department may apply for a court order directing such permittee and/or owner to comply with the commissioner's order or directing the department to perform the work specified in the commissioner's order. Such statement shall also indicate that if any of the work specified in the commissioner's order is performed by or on behalf of the department, the expense incurred in performing such work shall be a debt recoverable from such permittee and/or owner and a lien on the premises, including the land and buildings, with respect to which such order was issued.

   2. Service of such order shall be made upon such permittee and/or owner by personal service or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of such permittee and/or owner or in any manner provided for service of process by article three of the civil practice law and rules. The commissioner may serve a copy of such order on any mortgagee or lienor of record in the same manner.

   3. A copy of such order shall be filed with the office of the register in the county in which the premises with respect to which such order was issued are situated, provided, that in the county of Richmond, such copy shall be filed with the county clerk.

   4. Within fifteen days after service of such order upon the permittee and/or owner, such permittee and/or owner or a mortgagee or lienor upon whom a copy of such order has been served may request a hearing. Such hearing shall be conducted by the department. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings of fact and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who shall make the final findings of fact and the final determination.

c. If the permittee and/or owner fails to comply with the commissioner's order within the time fixed for compliance pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the department may perform the work specified in the order.

d. As an alternative to the remedy set forth in subdivision c of this section, if the permittee and/or owner fails to comply with the commissioner's order within the time fixed for compliance pursuant to subdivision b of this section, the commissioner may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction, upon such notice and in such manner as the court shall direct, for an order directing the permittee and/or owner to comply with the commissioner's order or directing the department to perform the work specified in the commissioner's order.

e. 1. Whenever the commissioner finds that there exists on premises declared to be a public nuisance pursuant to subdivision a of this section a condition that poses an imminent threat to the public health or safety which requires immediate remedial action, the commissioner may, in his or her discretion, order the permittee and/or owner to remove or abate such public nuisance, or direct the department to remove or abate such public nuisance, and, notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, no hearing shall be required to be held before the time fixed in the order for compliance, or before the department removes or abates such public nuisance, and the time for compliance provided in paragraph one of subdivision b of this section shall not apply to an order issued pursuant to this subdivision. Notice of an order or direction issued pursuant to this subdivision shall be served in the manner prescribed in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section, provided, that if the commissioner determines that service in such manner would result in delay prejudicial to the public health or safety, then the commissioner may serve such order or direction by delivery of a copy thereof to a person of suitable age and discretion in actual or apparent control of the premises to which it relates, or, if service cannot be made in such manner, by copy posted upon the premises to which it relates. An order or direction served in the manner prescribed in this subdivision shall take effect when delivered or when posted. After such order or direction takes effect, the commissioner shall serve such order or direction in the manner prescribed in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section. Such additional service shall include notice of the earlier service of such order or direction.

   2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if an order or direction is issued pursuant to paragraph one of this subdivision, a hearing shall be held within three business days of a request for such hearing and a determination shall be rendered within four business days of the conclusion of such hearing. Such hearing shall be conducted by the department. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings of fact and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who shall make the final findings of fact and the final determination.

   3. For the purpose of this subdivision, the finding whether an imminent threat to the public health or safety exists shall be based on factors that include but are not limited to: (i) the quantity of solid waste, or of material listed in subparagraph (b) of paragraph one of subdivision a of section 16-130 of this chapter, that may pose a threat; (ii) the types of solid waste, or of such material listed in such subparagraph, that may pose a threat; and/or (iii) the risk of harm to the public or the environment.

f. The commissioner may request the assistance of the department of health or any city, state or federal agency to perform work on its behalf pursuant to this section.

g. 1. The expense of the department with respect to any work performed by or on behalf of the department pursuant to subdivisions c, d and e of this section shall be a debt recoverable from the permittee and/or owner and a lien upon the premises, including the land and buildings, with respect to which such work was performed.

   2. The department shall keep a record of all work performed by or on behalf of the department. Such records shall be accessible to the public during business hours. Within thirty days after the issuance of a purchase or work order for such work, such order shall be entered on the records of the department. Such entry shall constitute notice to all parties.

   3. All such expenses shall constitute a lien upon the premises when the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments. However, no lien created pursuant to this section shall be enforced against a subsequent purchaser in good faith or mortgagee in good faith unless such transaction occurred after the date of entry of a purchase or work order on the records of the department pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision.

   4. A notice thereof stating the amount due and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such entry to the last known address of the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or, where no name appears, to the premises, addressed to either the owner or the agent. Such notice shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section.

   5. If such charge is not paid within thirty days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to receive interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable to such property for a delinquent tax on real property to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry.

   6. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises. Such charge and interest may be collected and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the collection and foreclosure of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water charges due and payable to the city and the provisions of chapter four of title eleven of the code shall apply to such charges and the interest thereon and the lien thereof.

   7. (a) In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i) the lawfulness of the work done; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this paragraph.

      (b) No such challenge may be made except by (i) the owner of the property, or (ii) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would but for the provisions of this section have priority over the department's lien.

      (c) An issue specified in subparagraph (a) which was decided or could have been contested in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order pursuant to subdivision d of this section shall not be open to reexamination, but if any mortgagee or lienor of record was not served with an order of the commissioner pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision b and with notice of such proceeding, his or her mortgage or lien shall have the same priority over the lien of the department that it would have had but for the provisions of this section.

   8. In addition to establishing a lien, the department may recover such expenses and interest by bringing an action against the permittee and/or owner. The institution of such action shall not suspend or bar the right to pursue any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such debt.

h. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to restrict authority to provide for the abatement of a public nuisance conferred upon any agency of the city by any other provision of law.

i. For purposes of this section, "owner" means a person having title to any premises or structure; a tenant, lessee or occupant; a mortgagee or vendee in possession; a trustee in bankruptcy; a receiver or any other person having legal ownership or control of any premises or structure.

Such equipment, vehicles or other personal property shall be released by the end of the following business day unless the department ascertains either (i) that the owner of the premises upon which the equipment, vehicles or other personal property has been or is being used has not obtained a permit required by section 16-130 of this chapter, (ii) that the owner has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of section 16-130, 16-131, 16-131.2 or 16-131.3 of this chapter, or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city health code, in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in a proceeding before an agency of competent jurisdiction and such violation was committed within eighteen months prior to the violation of law for which such equipment, vehicles or other personal property was impounded, or (iii) that the alleged violation of such sections or article for which such equipment, vehicles or other personal property was impounded involves the unlawful handling, processing, transportation, disposal or storage of a material identified as a hazardous waste or an acute hazardous waste in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 27-0903 of the environmental conservation law.

b. Notice of impoundment and intended forfeiture shall be served together with the notice of the violation of law for which equipment, vehicles or other personal property was impounded. Such notice shall contain notice of the right to request a hearing before the department with respect to whether there is reasonable cause to believe that such equipment, vehicles or other personal property will be subject to forfeiture; a hearing shall be provided within three business days of such request, and a determination shall be rendered within four business days of the conclusion of such hearing. The hearing officer shall submit recommended findings of fact and a recommended decision to the commissioner, who shall make the final findings of fact and the final determination. If the commissioner determines that there is not reasonable cause to believe that such equipment, vehicles or other personal property will be subject to forfeiture, the department shall release such equipment, vehicles or other personal property, and no charges or fees shall be imposed as a condition of such release. If the commissioner determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that such equipment, vehicles or other personal property will be subject to forfeiture, the department may retain such equipment, vehicles or other personal property pending forfeiture pursuant to the provisions of this section. If after adjudication of the violation of law for which such equipment, vehicles or other personal property was impounded the court or agency of competent jurisdiction finds the respondent not guilty of or not liable for such violation, such equipment, vehicles or other personal property shall be released forthwith, and no charges or fees shall be imposed as a condition of such release. If after adjudication of such violation of law, the court or agency of competent jurisdiction finds the respondent guilty of or liable for such violation, then upon demand of the respondent the department shall either release such equipment, vehicles or other personal property upon payment of all outstanding fines and civil penalties, and removal charges and storage fees, or commence a forfeiture proceeding pursuant to this section within ten days after such demand.

c. In addition to any other penalties provided in this section, the interest of an owner in any equipment, vehicles or other personal property impounded pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be subject to forfeiture upon notice and judicial determination thereof if such owner either (i) has not obtained a permit required by section 16-130 of this chapter and has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of section 16-130, 16-131, 16-131.2, or 16-131.3 of this chapter, or article one hundred fifty-seven of the New York city health code, in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in a proceeding before an agency of competent jurisdiction, (ii) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of one of such sections, or such article, two or more times, in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in a proceeding before such agency, both of which violations were committed within an eighteen month period, or (iii) has been convicted of or found liable for a violation of one of such sections or such article in a civil or criminal judicial proceeding or in a proceeding before such agency where such violation involved the unlawful handling, processing, transportation, disposal or storage of a material identified as a hazardous waste or an acute hazardous waste in regulations promulgated pursuant to section 27-0903 of the environmental conservation law.

d. Except as hereinafter provided, the city agency having custody of equipment, vehicles or other personal property, after judicial determination of forfeiture, shall no sooner than thirty days after such determination upon a notice of at least five days, sell such forfeited equipment, vehicles or other personal property at public sale, provided that no sooner than thirty days after judicial determination of forfeiture or the date of final determination of a claim asserted pursuant to this subdivision, whichever is later, the city may instead convert such equipment, vehicles or other personal property to its own use. Any person, other than an owner whose interest is forfeited pursuant to this section, who establishes a right of ownership in equipment, vehicles or other personal property, including a part ownership or security interest, shall be entitled to delivery of the equipment, vehicles or other personal property if such person:

   1. redeems the ownership interest which was subject to forfeiture by payment to the city of the value thereof; and

   2. pays the reasonable expenses of the safekeeping of the vehicle between the time of seizure and such redemption; and

   3. asserts a claim within thirty days after judicial determination of forfeiture. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions establishment of a claim shall not entitle such person to delivery if the city establishes that the activity in violation of law for which the equipment, vehicles or other property was seized was expressly or impliedly permitted by such person.

e. For purposes of this section, "owner" means a person, other than a holder of a security interest, having the property in or title to equipment, vehicles or other personal property, including but not limited to a person entitled to use and possession of equipment, vehicles or other personal property subject to a security interest in another person and also includes any lessee or bailee having exclusive use thereof.

   1. the effectiveness of procedures employed and the criteria applied by the department for the issuance and renewal of permits for the operation of putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations in minimizing potential adverse environmental economic and public health impacts on the communities in which such transfer stations are located by examining such issues as (i) the effectiveness of the criteria applied by the department to the siting of putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations, including the aggregate effect of the geographic proximity of solid waste transfer stations to each other and (ii) the scope and effectiveness of the operational restrictions imposed upon putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations including the hours of operation and any performance standards established in the zoning resolution of the city of New York;

   2. the manner in which all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to the operation of putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations, private carters and long haul transport vehicles are enforced, including who should be responsible for such enforcement and the effectiveness of such enforcement in obtaining compliance with such laws, rules and regulations and in minimizing potential environmental economic and public health impacts and an analysis of rules relating to routes for transporting material to or from such transfer stations;

   3. the means and potential effects of limiting the number and capacity of putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations in the city;

   4. the size and type of vehicles that should be authorized to transport solid waste to or from putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations and fuel-type requirements for such vehicles;

   5. whether putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations and city-owned marine transfer stations should receive and process both residential and commercial solid waste and the options for transporting such solid waste to and from such transfer stations, including an analysis of potential environmental, economic and public health impacts; and

   6. potential environmental, economic and public health impacts on communities in which large numbers of privately-owned putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations are located such as, but not limited to, potential impacts related to air quality, water quality, odors, traffic congestion and noise.

a. The commissioner, upon the recommendation of the solid waste management board and upon the approval of the board of estimate, may exempt that portion of privately collected solid waste from all or some provisions of any regulations for such period of time as is necessary and appropriate up to forty years, if the regulation of that solid waste will materially and adversely interfere with the development, financing or operation of any resource recovery facility owned or operated or being developed privately. Any person seeking an exemption shall do so by filing with the solid waste management board a petition for exemption in a form prescribed by such board. Such form shall document the need for an exemption. The effective date of any exemptions granted may be withheld until a bona fide, firm, long-term contract has been executed for delivery of such solid waste to a safe and reliable facility and copy of such contract has been received by the solid waste management board.

b. In the event that any resource recovery facility owned or operated privately fails to adequately process or dispose of solid waste and such facility does not provide for alternate storage, processing or disposal, the privately collected solid waste exempted from regulation and not disposed by the facility may be made subject to any regulation for which it had been exempted.

c. (1) Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or limit private collectors from extracting from the waste they collect materials that have value to such collectors for the purposes of recycling, reuse or resale.

   (2) Any regulations promulgated shall not limit the amount or type of solid waste utilized by any person for the purposes of composting, materials recovery from solid waste, or operation of a recycling center.

d. Such regulations shall make reasonable accommodation to permit persons to deliver solid waste to recycling facilities or permitted transfer facilities for the sole purpose of materials reclamation or volume reduction, provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall materially impair the authority of the com- missioner to enforce the regulation of the residual solid waste resulting from such reclamation or volume reduction activities in accordance with this chapter.

If the commissioner determines that the cost to the city of recycling rigid plastic containers is not reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision, the commissioner shall annually reevaluate the cost to the city of designating such rigid plastic containers as recyclable materials, and shall annually make a new determination as to whether the cost of designating such containers as recyclable materials is reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision and shall report such evaluations to the council as part of the department's annual recycling report required pursuant to subdivision k of section 16-305 of this chapter. The department shall not promulgate rules designating rigid plastic containers as recyclable materials, and need not conduct outreach or education relating thereto if, pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision, the commissioner determines that the cost to the city of recycling rigid plastic containers is not reasonable in comparison with the cost of recycling only metal, glass and plastic that have been designated as recyclable materials as of the effective date of the local law that added this subdivision.

   4. Immediately following the promulgation of rules designating rigid plastic containers as recyclable materials, the department shall undertake outreach and education, in cooperation with any other agency or entity designated for that purpose by the commissioner, to inform residents of such new designation and to provide instruction on compliance with the requirements of this subdivision and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto.

d. The commissioner shall adopt and implement rules establishing procedures requiring the placement of the designated materials at the curbside, in specialized containers, or in any other manner the commissioner determines, to facilitate the collection of such materials in a manner that enables them to be recycled. Under such rules, no person shall be liable for incorrectly placing a non-designated rigid plastic container in the recycling stream.

e. Where the department provides solid waste collection services to a building containing at least four and no more than eight dwelling units, the commissioner shall adopt and implement rules requiring the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building to:

   1. provide for the residents, where practicable, a designated area and, where appropriate, containers in which to store the source separated or other designated recyclable materials to be collected by the department; and

   2. inform all residents of the requirements of this chapter and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto by, at a minimum, posting instructions on source separation in or near the designated recycling area and making available to each resident at the inception of a lease, where applicable, a department-issued guide to recycling, which shall be made available to the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building by the department pursuant to section 16-315 of this chapter in print form or on the department's website, or in an alternative guide containing similar information to the guide required by section 16-315 of this chapter. If reasonably accessible space for the storage of source separated or other designated recyclable materials is not available in such building, and such space is available behind the building's property line, such space behind the property line may be designated as the area for the storage of source separated or other designated recyclable materials. If no such space is available, the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building shall post instructions on recycling and source separation in or near a designated area that is visible to all residents in the building. With respect to solid waste generated by households in the aforesaid buildings, the obligations of an owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building under this chapter shall be limited to those set forth in this subdivision and subdivisions d and g of this section or rules promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions.

f. Where the department provides solid waste collection services to a building containing nine or more dwelling units, the commissioner shall adopt and implement rules requiring the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building to:

   1. provide for the residents a designated area and, where appropriate, containers in which to store the source separated or other designated recyclable materials to be collected by the department;

   2. inform all residents of the requirements of this chapter and the rules promulgated pursuant thereto by, at a minimum, posting instructions on source separation in or near the designated recycling area, and making available to each resident at the inception of a lease, a department-issued guide to recycling, which shall be made available to the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building by the department pursuant to section 16-315 of this chapter in print form or on the department's website, or in an alternative guide containing similar information to the guide required by section 16-315 of this chapter; and

   3. remove non-designated materials from the containers of designated source separated recyclable materials before such containers are placed at the curbside for collection and ensure that the designated materials are placed at the curbside in the manner prescribed by the department. With respect to solid waste generated by households in the aforesaid buildings, the obligations of an owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building under this chapter shall be limited to those set forth in this subdivision and subdivisions d and g of this section or rules promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions.

   g. The commissioner shall adopt and implement rules for any building containing four or more dwelling units in which the amount of designated materials placed out for collection is significantly less than what can reasonably be expected from such building. These rules shall require residential generators, including tenants, owners, net lessees or persons in charge of such building to use transparent bags or such other means of disposal the commissioner deems appropriate to dispose of solid waste other than the designated recyclable materials. Upon request of the owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building, and if the commissioner determines that such owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building has complied with this subdivision, subdivision d of this section and, as applicable, subdivision e or subdivision f of this section or rules promulgated pursuant to such subdivisions and that the amount of designated materials placed out for collection remains significantly less than what can reasonably be expected from such building, the department may develop a schedule to conduct random inspections to facilitate compliance with the provisions of this chapter by tenants of such building, provided that lawful inspections may occur at reasonable times without notice to ensure compliance by the tenants, owner, net lessee or person in charge of such building.

h. 1. In calculating the extent to which the department has met the recycling percentage goals set forth in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section, the department shall include in its calculations all curbside and institutional recycling it collects, including materials collected from households, schools, not-for-profit institutions and city agencies, and all recyclable materials collected as part of the public space recycling program pursuant to section 16-310 of this chapter, and may include yard waste collected pursuant to section 16-308 of this chapter and any other material collected for composting pursuant to this chapter, Christmas trees collected pursuant to section 16-309 of this chapter, clothing and textiles donated or collected pursuant to section 16-310.1 of this chapter, household hazardous waste diverted pursuant to section 16-310.3 of this chapter, rechargeable batteries collected pursuant to chapter four of this title, beverage containers returned within the city pursuant to title ten of article twenty-seven of the environmental conservation law, electronic waste collected within the city or otherwise diverted from the city's waste stream, including such waste collected or diverted pursuant to title twenty-six of article twenty-seven of the environmental conservation law, and plastic bags collected within the city or otherwise diverted from the city's waste stream, including such plastic bags collected or diverted pursuant to title twenty seven of article twenty seven of the environmental conservation law.

The commissioner shall not designate any such materials as recyclable materials under this section for purposes of calculating the extent to which the department has met such recycling percentage goals.

   4. In calculating the percent of the department-managed solid waste stream recycled in connection with the percentage goals set forth in paragraph one of subdivision a of this section, the department shall ensure that any quantity of material counted as recycled must be fully included in the calculation of the city's total department-managed solid waste stream.

   5. All data used to make calculations pursuant to paragraphs one and two of this subdivision shall be made available on the department's website in raw form disaggregated by material type and using a non-proprietary format on a monthly basis, or, if such data is not generated by the department, within one month from the date that the department receives reports of such information.

i. In the event that the department does not meet any recycling percentage goal set forth in paragraphs one or two of subdivision a of this section by the dates specified therein, the department shall, within sixty days of the date for meeting such goal, expand recycling outreach and education and shall take such other appropriate measures including, but not limited to, directing such outreach and education to the neighborhoods and community districts in which recycling diversion rates fall below the median city recycling diversion rate and consulting with the council to explore additional measures to meet the recycling percentage goals set forth in such subdivision. In expanding recycling outreach and education, the department may work with other agencies or entities designated for that purpose by the commissioner.

j. In the event that the department is unable to achieve two consecutive recycling percentage goals set forth in paragraphs one and two of subdivision a of this section by the dates specified therein, in addition to the requirements of subdivision i of this section, the commissioner shall retain a special advisor, who shall be selected by the mayor and the speaker, provided that the commissioner need not retain such special advisor more than once every three years. Within one hundred twenty days of such retention, such adviser shall submit a report to the mayor and council recommending additional measures that may be taken by the city following such report in order to meet such recycling percentage goals.

k. 1. Beginning on March first, two thousand eleven and annually thereafter, the department shall submit to the mayor and the council and make available on its website, an annual department recycling report which shall include provisions addressing: the extent to which the department has met the recycling percentage goals set forth in paragraphs one and two of subdivision a of this section and including a description of the methodology used to arrive at its recycling percentages; city agency recycling pursuant to section 16-307 of this chapter; department of education recycling pursuant to section 16-307.1 of this chapter; yard waste composting pursuant to section 16-308 of this chapter; Christmas tree composting or recycling pursuant to section 16-309 of this chapter; the public space recycling program pursuant to section 16-310 of this chapter; the clothing and textiles collection program pursuant to section 16-310.1 of this chapter; household hazardous waste collected pursuant to section 16-310.3 of this chapter or otherwise collected by the department; and any composting capacity determinations or food waste composting pilot programs pursuant to section 16-316.2 of this chapter.

Beginning the year that the department commences delivering department-managed recyclable materials to a designated recycling processing facility, the department shall annually report to the council the cost to the city of designating as recyclable materials any rigid plastic containers not previously designated by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision c of this section, and the then-current market value of any such materials.






*§ 16-305.1 Weekly collection of designated recyclable materials.* ::


a. Weekly collection of designated recyclable materials shall be maintained in all local service delivery districts.

b. Effective July first, two thousand three, and notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this chapter, the department shall be authorized, by written order of the commissioner, to implement and maintain alternate week collection of designated recyclable materials in all local service delivery districts, provided that the department may, by written order of the commissioner, provide for more frequent collection of designated recyclable materials in designated local service delivery districts. Any such written order of the commissioner implementing alternate week collection shall expire no later than March thirty-first, two thousand four.

c. For purposes of this section "designated recyclable materials" shall mean solid waste that has been designated by the commissioner as recyclable pursuant to section 16-305 or section 16-307 of this chapter.

d. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require collection of designated recyclable materials in such parts of the city or during such times of the year that such materials are not otherwise collected.






*§ 16-306 Private carter-collected waste.* ::


a. The commissioner shall adopt and implement rules designating recyclable materials that constitute in the aggregate at least one-half of all solid waste collected by private carters, and additional materials if the commissioner determines that economic markets exist for them. Pursuant to subdivision b of this section, such rules shall require generators of private carter-collected waste to source separate some or all of the designated materials and to arrange for lawful collection for recycling, reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other than private carters of such source separated materials. With regard to designated materials that are not required by such rules to be source separated, generators of private carter-collected waste may source separate these designated materials and, in any event, shall arrange for their lawful collection for recycling, reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other than private carters. If a generator or private carter-collected waste has source separated the designated materials in accordance with the rules and arranged for the lawful collection for recycling, reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other than private carters of such source separated materials and, with regard to designated materials that are not required by such rules to be source separated, arranged for lawful collection for recycling, reuse or sale for reuse by private carters or persons other than private carters, such arrangement shall constitute an affirmative defense to any proceeding brought against the generator pursuant to section 16-324 of this chapter.

b. The rules promulgated pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall require that generators of waste collected by businesses required to be licensed pursuant to section 16-505 of this code source separate the designated materials in such manner and to such extent as the commissioner determines to be necessary to minimize contamination and maximize the marketability of such materials. However, in promulgating such rules the commissioner shall not require source separation of a material unless the commissioner has determined that an economic market exists for such material. For the purpose of this section, the term "economic market" refers to instances in which the full avoided costs of proper collection, transportation and disposal of source separated materials are equal to or greater than the cost of collection, transportation and sale of said materials less the amount received from the sale of said materials. The New York city business integrity commission shall adopt and implement rules requiring businesses licensed to remove, collect or dispose of trade waste to provide for the collection of, and ensure the continued separation of, designated materials that have been source separated, provide for the separation of all other designated materials, and provide for recycling of all the designated materials. Rules promulgated by the business integrity commission pursuant to this subdivision shall be enforced in the manner provided in section 16-517 of this code and violations of such rules shall be subject to the penalties provided in subdivision a of section 16-515 of this code for violation of the provisions of chapter one of title 16-A of this code. In addition, the commissioner shall have the authority to issue notices of violation for any violation of such rule and such notices of violation shall be returnable in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner before the environmental control board which shall impose a penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars for each such violation.

c. The department shall complete a study of commercial recycling in the city no later than January first, two thousand twelve. Such commercial recycling study shall focus on the putrescible portion of the commercial waste stream, and shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (i) an integration of all data on commercial waste in the city collected and transported through transfer stations and recycling processors; (ii) an assessment of current practices, operations and compliance with applicable local laws and rules, consistent with the scope of study set forth in the 2006 Solid Waste Management Plan; (iii) estimates of waste composition and recycling diversion rates from research conducted with respect to other jurisdictions; (iv) a computer-based model to measure the amount and composition of waste generated by different commercial sectors; (v) recommendations of methods to encourage waste prevention, reuse, recycling and composting for each of the commercial sectors studied, including any recommended changes to applicable law; and (vi) an assessment of the efficiency of the transportation of commercial waste within the commercial system by, among other things, mapping and monitoring routes along which commercial waste and recycling trucks travel, including long-haul carriers within and outside the city. Following completion of the commercial recycling study, the commissioner shall determine whether any additional studies are necessary in order to improve commercial recycling practices in the city and shall promptly report such determination to the mayor and the council.

   1. For residential buildings containing fewer than nine dwelling units, the civil penalty shall be in an amount of twenty-five dollars for the first violation, fifty dollars for the second violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, and one hundred dollars for the third and each subsequent violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, provided that the court before which such civil action is brought or such board may waive the penalty for the first violation upon a showing of good cause.

   2. For residential buildings containing nine or more dwelling units and commercial, manufacturing or industrial buildings, the civil penalty shall be in an amount of one hundred dollars for the first violation, two hundred dollars for the second violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, and four hundred dollars for the third and each subsequent violation committed on a different day within a period of twelve months, provided that the court before which such civil action is brought or such board may waive the penalty for the first violation upon a showing of good cause. The owner, net lessee or person in charge of any residential building of nine or more dwelling units or a commercial, manufacturing or industrial building with respect to which four or more violations were committed on different days within a period of six months shall be classified as a persistent violator.

In no event may such agreement for the supplemental collection of recyclable material provide for the removal of department-marked items.

      ii. Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow the owner or agent of any building containing four or more units or any building that is occupied by a city agency or institution receiving department collection to enter into an agreement for recycling collection on the same day as regularly scheduled department collection of recyclable material for any such building.

      iii. Any agreement lawfully entered into for the supplemental collection of recyclable material pursuant to this paragraph shall be written; signed and dated by the owner or agent and by or on behalf of the person responsible for the supplemental collection of recyclable material; notarized; filed with the commissioner within five business days of being signed; and shall include the address of the building receiving supplemental collection; the names, telephone numbers and taxpayer identification numbers, including individual or employer taxpayer identification numbers, but not social security numbers, of the person responsible for the collection of such material; the names, titles and telephone numbers of all signatories to such agreement; the terms relating to price and the days and times of collection, if any; the duration of such agreement; the estimated quantity of recyclable material to be collected on a weekly basis; and any other information required by the commissioner by rule.

   3. For any department-marked item removed in violation of this subdivision, a written agreement between the owner of a residential building or an authorized agent of such owner, and the person removing such item shall not be a defense in any proceeding before the environmental control board or other court of appropriate jurisdiction to the improper removal of such item.

c. Commercial buildings. Except for an authorized employee of a person licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission pursuant to subdivision a or b of section 16-505 of this code, it shall be unlawful for any person to remove and transport by motor vehicle any amount of recyclable material that has been placed by any owner, tenant or occupant of a commercial building, or by their agent, within the stoop area, adjacent to the curb line or otherwise adjacent to such building for collection or removal by an entity licensed by or registered with the business integrity commission pursuant to subdivision a or b of section 16-505 of this code.

No peace officer, employee of the department or of the environmental control board, employee of any company under contract with the department, or employee of any governmental entity that, in conjunction with the department, conducts enforcement activity relating to a violation of section 16-461 of this chapter, shall be entitled to obtain the benefit of any such reward when acting in the discharge of his or her official duties.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that all recyclable material received for storage, collection or processing was generated within the city of New York. This subdivision shall not apply to a redemption center, dealer or distributor as defined in section 27-1003 of the environmental conservation law, or to any person who, using a motor vehicle, collects recyclable containers in bulk and is required to be registered pursuant to local law.

*§ 16-498.1 Reduction of overall permitted capacity.* ::


a. By October 1, 2019 or the relevant operational date, whichever is later, the commissioner shall, for each designated community district, set the permitted capacity for each putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer station operating in such designated community district. The permitted capacity of each putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer station in community district one in the borough of Brooklyn shall be reduced by 50 percent below the permitted capacity for such transfer station on the effective date of the local law that added this section. The permitted capacity of each putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer station in community districts one and two in the borough of the Bronx and community district 12 in the borough of Queens shall be reduced by 33 percent below the permitted capacity for such transfer station on the effective date of the local law that added this section.

b. Any reductions in permitted capacity required pursuant to this section for a transfer station in a designated community district shall be implemented at the time that the transfer station's permit is renewed.

c. On exempted days occurring after the date that reductions under this section are implemented for a designated community district, a putrescible solid waste transfer station in such designated community district may process waste in an amount equivalent to such transfer station's permitted capacity prior to the reductions required by this section.








*§ 16-498.2 Allocating reductions of permitted capacity.* ::


a. The commissioner shall not impose the reductions to permitted capacity required by section 16-498.1 on any putrescible or non-putrescible solid waste transfer station that exports by rail all or the majority of the waste accepted at any such transfer station and which does not use a public street to transport such waste between such transfer station and the rail facility.

b. The commissioner shall determine the average daily amount of solid waste transported by barge for the three years preceding October 1, 2019, or the operational date, whichever is later, by each putrescible solid waste transfer station within a designated community district. In calculating any required reduction in permitted capacity for a putrescible solid waste transfer station pursuant to section 16-498.1, the commissioner shall not include, in any amount required to be reduced, such average daily amount of waste transported by barge, provided that:

   1. On or before April 1, 2019, the owner of such transfer station submits an application to the commissioner to modify its permit to restrict the use of its permitted capacity, or a portion thereof, exclusively to putrescible solid waste that is transported out of the city from such transfer station by barge, and that application is approved by the commissioner; and

   2. By October 1, 2019, or the relevant operational date, whichever is later, any such transfer station restricts the use of its permitted capacity, or such portion thereof, exclusively to putrescible solid waste that is transported from such transfer station by barge.

c. A putrescible solid waste transfer station may reserve up to 20 percent of its permitted capacity exclusively for source separated organic waste to be recycled. Such reserved amount shall not be included in the transfer station's permitted capacity when the commissioner calculates any required reduction in permitted capacity for such putrescible solid waste transfer station pursuant to section 16-498.1, provided that:

   1. On or before April 1, 2019, the owner of such transfer station submits an application to the commissioner to modify its permit to restrict the use of its permitted capacity, or a portion thereof, exclusively to source separated organic waste, and that application is approved by the commissioner; and

   2. By October 1, 2019, or the relevant operational date, whichever is later, any such transfer station restricts the use of its permitted capacity, or such portion reserved for source separated organic waste, exclusively to source separated organic waste.

d. The commissioner shall determine the average daily amount of metal, glass, plastic, paper and corrugated cardboard recycled for the three years preceding October 1, 2019, or the operational date, whichever is later, by each transfer station within a designated community district. In calculating any required reduction in permitted capacity pursuant to section 16-498.1, the commissioner shall not include, in any amount required to be reduced, the lesser of (i) such average daily amount of recycled metal, glass, plastic, paper and corrugated cardboard or (ii) 20 percent of the transfer station's permitted capacity.

e. The commissioner shall determine the average daily amount of construction and demolition debris recycled for the three years preceding October 1, 2019, or the operational date, whichever is later, by each non-putrescible solid waste transfer station within a designated community district. In calculating any required reduction in permitted capacity pursuant to section 16-498.1, the commissioner shall not include, in any amount required to be reduced, 50 percent of such average daily amount of construction and demolition debris.

f. After a reduction in permitted capacity required by section 16-498.1 in a designated community district, each non-putrescible solid waste transfer station within such community district shall have a total quarterly capacity equal to the permitted capacity allocated to such transfer station multiplied by 78. The amount of non-putrescible waste that may be delivered to a non-putrescible transfer station on any single day may not exceed such transfer station's daily permitted capacity prior to the reductions required by this section.








*§ 16-498.3 Waiver.* ::


a. The commissioner may waive the reductions to permitted capacity and the limits to total quarterly capacity required by this chapter for the duration of any emergency.

b. After the reductions in permitted capacity required by section 16-498.1 have been implemented at a transfer station in a designated community district, the commissioner may, on a one-time basis, increase the permitted capacity of any such transfer station that seeks a modification to its permit solely to increase the amount of organic waste or metal, glass, plastic, paper or corrugated cardboard that is separated for recycling, provided that such increase shall be no greater than 20 percent of the transfer station's then-existing permitted capacity.








*§ 16-498.4 Overconcentrated districts.* ::


After October 1, 2019, the commissioner shall not increase permitted capacity for any putrescible or non-putrescible solid waste transfer station in an overconcentrated district or increase permitted capacity for any community district that would result in such district becoming an overconcentrated district, except in accordance with section 16-498.3, and except the commissioner may allow increased permitted capacity for any putrescible or non-putrescible solid waste transfer station that exports by rail all or the majority of the waste accepted at any such transfer station and which does not use a public street to transport such waste between such transfer station and the rail facility, and except that the commissioner may authorize the transfer of permitted capacity from a putrescible solid waste transfer station within a designated community district to another putrescible solid waste transfer station, within the same community district, for which the commissioner has set a reduced permitted capacity in accordance with subdivision a of section 16-498.1, or from a non-putrescible solid waste transfer station within a designated community district to another non-putrescible solid waste transfer station, within the same community district, for which the commissioner has set a reduced permitted capacity in accordance with subdivision a of section 16-498.1, provided that a transfer station receiving a transfer of permitted capacity may use such transferred permitted capacity only after the implementation, in accordance with subdivision b of section 16-498.1, of such reduction, and provided further that the permitted capacity of any transfer station receiving a transfer of permitted capacity may not exceed the permitted capacity of such transfer station that was in effect before the commissioner set a reduced permitted capacity for such transfer station in accordance with subdivision a of section 16-498.1, and provided further that the transfer station that is transferring its permitted capacity will no longer be operating as a waste transfer station after the transfer.








*§ 16-498.5 Reporting.* ::


On or before October 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, the commissioner shall report to the mayor and the speaker of the council the following information:

a. A list of permitted solid waste transfer stations and for each such station, organized by community district:

   1. The community district in which such transfer station is located;

   2. The type of material permitted for acceptance at such transfer station;

   3. The permitted capacity of such transfer station;

   4. The average amount of waste accepted daily at such transfer station for each quarter year of the previous calendar year; and

   5. a. Any change to such transfer station's permitted capacity during the previous calendar year, specifying which changes were required pursuant to this chapter.

      b. The feasibility of reducing truck traffic traveling through residential neighborhoods by means other than reductions to permitted capacity for transfer stations.








*§ 16-498.6 Notification.* ::


No later than 120 days after the end of each quarter year, the commissioner shall notify the mayor and the speaker of the council if the amount of waste delivered to permitted solid waste transfer stations located within any community district is in excess of 90 percent of the total permitted capacity for such transfer stations. Such notification shall include the percentage of the total citywide permitted capacity for putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste transfer stations, including transfer stations operated by or on behalf of the department, in such community district for the quarter year and the percentage of the total citywide putrescible and non-putrescible solid waste delivered to such community district for the quarter year.








*§ 16-498.7 Displaced employee list.* ::


The commissioner shall maintain a list containing the names and contact addresses or telephone numbers of persons formerly employed by a transfer station in a designated community district whose employment ended as a result of the a reduction in permitted capacity required pursuant to section 16-498.1. The addition or deletion of information on such list relating to a person on such list shall be made only upon the request of such person. A copy of such list shall be made available upon request by an owner or operator of a transfer facility and shall be sent to all transfer stations on an annual basis. The provision of such list shall in no way be construed as a recommendation by the city regarding the employment of any person on such list, nor shall the city be responsible for the accuracy of the information set forth therein.
