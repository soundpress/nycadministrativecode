        §  192.  City planning commission. a.  There shall be a  city planning
      commission to consist of the chair and twelve other members.  The  mayor
      shall  appoint  the chair and   six other members of the commission, the
      public advocate shall appoint one member,  and  each  borough  president
      shall   appoint   one  member.    Members  shall  be  chosen  for  their
      independence, integrity and  civic  commitment.    Appointments  of  all
      members,  except  for  the  chair,  shall  be  subject to the advice and
      consent of the council.  For such appointments by officials  other  than
      the  mayor,  the  procedure  for obtaining the advice and consent of the
      council shall be the same as  the  procedure  provided  for  in  section
      thirty-one  for appointments by the mayor.  Except as otherwise provided
      in section one hundred ninety-one, no member shall hold any  other  city
      office.    Members other than the chair shall be appointed for a term of
      five years; provided, however, that of the members other than the chair,
      one member appointed by the mayor and one member appointed by a  borough
      president  shall serve for terms to expire on the thirtieth day of June,
      nineteen hundred ninety-one; one member appointed by the mayor  and  one
      member  appointed by a borough president shall serve for terms to expire
      on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred  ninety-two;  one  member
      appointed  by  the mayor and one member appointed by a borough president
      shall serve for terms to expire on the thirtieth day of  June,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-three;  one member appointed by the mayor and one member
      appointed by a borough president shall serve for terms to expire on  the
      thirtieth  day  of  June,  nineteen hundred ninety-four; and two members
      appointed by the mayor, the member appointed by the public advocate  and
      one  member  appointed  by  a borough president shall serve for terms to
      expire on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred ninety-five.   The
      borough  presidents  shall determine by lot the length of the term to be
      served by the member first appointed  by  each  borough  president.  The
      appointing   officials  shall  make  their  first  appointments  to  the
      commission on or before the first day of March, nineteen hundred ninety.
      The commission members so appointed shall assume office on the first day
      of July, nineteen hundred ninety.   Members of  the  commission    shall
      serve until their successors have been confirmed.  Any vacancy occurring
      other  than  by expiration of a term shall be filled by the official who
      appointed the member in the same manner as the original appointment.   A
      person so appointed shall serve for the unexpired portion of the term of
      the  member  succeeded.    Terms  shall begin on the next date after the
      expiration date of the preceding term.
        b.  Members, except for the chair, shall  not  be  considered  regular
      employees  of  the  city for purposes of chapter sixty-eight. The agency
      served by the members of the commission shall for  purposes  of  chapter
      sixty-eight  be  deemed  to be both the commission and the department of
      city planning. No member,  while  serving  as  a  member,  shall  appear
      directly  or  indirectly  before  the department, the commission, or any
      other city agency for which the conflicts of interest  board  shall,  by
      rule,  determine such appearance creates a conflict of interest with the
      duties and responsibilities of the member.  No firm in  which  a  member
      has  an interest may appear directly or indirectly before the department
      or commission.   For purposes  of  this  section,  the  terms  "agency,"
      "appear," "firm," and "interest" shall be defined as provided in chapter
      sixty-eight.
        c.  One of the members other than the chair shall be designated by the
      mayor as vice-chair and shall serve as vice-chair at the pleasure of the
      mayor. The vice-chair shall possess  the powers and perform  the  duties
      of  the  chair when the chair is absent or while a vacancy exists in the
      office of the chair, and shall at such times serve as director  of  city
      planning.
    
        d.   The city planning commission shall be responsible for the conduct
      of planning relating to  the  orderly  growth,  improvement  and  future
      development  of  the city, including  adequate and appropriate resources
      for the housing,  business,    industry,  transportation,  distribution,
      recreation,  culture,  comfort,  convenience,  health and welfare of its
      population.
        e. The city planning commission shall oversee implementation  of  laws
      that  require  environmental  reviews of actions taken by the city.  The
      commission shall establish by rule procedures for environmental  reviews
      of  proposed actions by the city where such reviews are required by law.
      Such rules shall include procedures for (1) selection of the city agency
      or agencies that  will  be  responsible  for    determining  whether  an
      environmental impact statement is required in connection with a proposed
      action and for  preparation and filing of any such statement required by
      law,  (2)  participation  by the city in environmental reviews involving
      agencies other than city agencies and (3) coordination of  environmental
      review  procedures with the land use review procedures set forth in this
      charter.  The director of city planning  and  the  commissioner  of  the
      department  of  environmental protection shall assign from the staffs of
      such departments an office of environmental  coordination,  which  shall
      provide   assistance   to   all   city   agencies  in  fulfilling  their
      environmental review responsibilities.
        f.  Not later than the thirty-first day of December, nineteen  hundred
      ninety-two  and  every  four years thereafter, the commission shall file
      with  the  mayor,  the  council,  the  public  advocate,   the   borough
      presidents,  and the community boards, a zoning and planning report. The
      report shall include (1) a statement  of  the  planning  policy  of  the
      commission,  which  policy  shall  take  into consideration, among other
      things, the ten-year capital strategy, the  four-year  capital  program,
      the  report on the social, economic and environmental health of the city
      issued pursuant to section  sixteen,  the  strategic  policy  statements
      provided for in section seventeen and plans approved pursuant to section
      one  hundred  ninety-seven-a, (2) a summary of the significant plans and
      studies completed or undertaken by the department of  city  planning  in
      the  preceding  four  years,  (3)  an  analysis of those portions of the
      zoning resolution that merit reconsideration in light  of  the  planning
      policy of the commission and (4) proposals for implementing the planning
      policy  of the commission whether by amendment of the zoning resolution,
      development of plans or otherwise.
