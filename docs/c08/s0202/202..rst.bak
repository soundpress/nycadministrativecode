      public places and blocks within the limits of the city shall be received
      for  filing  in  the office in which instruments affecting real property
      are required to be recorded in the county in which the land is situated,

      unless such street, avenue, highway or public place shall lie within the
      lines of a street, avenue, highway or public place upon the city map.
