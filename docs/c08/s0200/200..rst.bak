Section 200. ::    
        
     
        §  200. Zoning resolution. a. Except as provided in subdivision b, any
      existing resolution or regulation of the council, the board of  estimate
      or  of the city planning commission to regulate and limit the height and
      bulk of buildings, to regulate and determine the area of  yards,  courts
      and  other open spaces, to regulate density of population or to regulate
      and restrict the locations of trades  and  industries  and  location  of
      buildings  designed for specific uses or creating districts for any such
      purpose, including any such regulation which provides that the board  of
      standards  and  appeals  may  determine and vary the application of such
      resolutions or regulations in harmony with  their  general  purpose  and
      intent  and  in  accordance  with general or specific rules contained in
      such regulations, may be amended, repealed  or  added  to  only  in  the
      following manner:
        1.  The  city  planning  commission may upon its own initiative at any
      time or upon application as provided in section two hundred one, adopt a
      resolution to amend the text of the zoning  resolution  subject  to  the
      limitations  provided  by  law. Before adopting any such resolution, the
      commission shall notify any community board or borough board affected by
      the resolution and shall afford persons interested an opportunity to  be
      heard  at  a time and place to be specified in a notice of hearing to be
      published in the City Record for the ten days of publication of the City
      Record immediately prior thereto setting  forth  in  general  terms  the
      nature  of the proposed resolution and a statement of the place at which
      the entire resolution may be examined.
        2.  Any resolution by the commission approving a change in the text of
      the zoning resolution shall be subject to review  and  approval  by  the
      council  pursuant  to section one hundred ninety-seven-d. Any resolution
      for a zoning text change which the mayor shall  have  certified  to  the
      council  as necessary, and which has been disapproved by the commission,
      may be adopted by the council by a two-thirds vote and, after notice  to
      the  parties affected, a public hearing. The council shall act upon such
      resolution within fifty days of the filing of the certification  of  the
      mayor  with the council, and such resolution shall become effective upon
      approval by the council.
        3. In case a protest against such a resolution approved  by  the  city
      planning  commission  shall have been presented to the city clerk within
      thirty days from the date of the filing  of  such  resolution  with  the
      council,  duly  signed and acknowledged by the owners of twenty per cent
      or more of the area of:
        (1) the land included in changes proposed in such proposed resolution,
      or
        (2)  the  land  immediately  adjacent  extending  one   hundred   feet
      therefrom, or
        (3)  the land, if any, directly opposite thereto extending one hundred
      feet from the street frontage of such  opposite  land,  such  resolution
      shall  not be effective after the filing of such protest unless approved
      by the council by a three-fourths vote within one  hundred  eighty  days
      after  the  filing of said resolution with the city clerk. The effective
      date of such resolution, if so approved,  shall  be  the  date  of  such
      approval.    A protest duly filed as herein provided may be withdrawn at
      any time within  sixty  days  from  the  date  of  the  filing  of  such
      resolution.
        b.  Designations  of  zoning districts under the zoning resolution and
      the issuance of special permits which under  the  terms  of  the  zoning
      resolution  are  within the jurisdiction of the city planning commission
      shall be subject to review  and  approval  pursuant  to  the  procedures
      provided  in  section one hundred ninety-seven-c and section one hundred
      ninety-seven-d, except that whenever the city  planning  commission  has
    
      not  recommended  approval  of a proposed change in the designation of a
      zoning district or the issuance of a special  permit  under  the  zoning
      resolution  or  has  failed  to  act  on  such  a matter within the time
      specified  in  section  one  hundred  ninety-seven-c,  the  council by a
      two-thirds vote may approve such change or the issuance of  such  permit
      only  if  the mayor shall have certified to the council that such change
      or issuance is necessary. The council shall act upon such designation or
      permit within fifty days of the filing of the certification of the mayor
      with the council.
