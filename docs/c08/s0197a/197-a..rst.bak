Section 197-a. ::    
        
     
        §  197-a. Plans. a. Plans for the development, growth, and improvement
      of the city and of its boroughs and community districts may be  proposed
      by  (1)  the mayor, (2) the city planning commission, (3) the department
      of city planning, (4) a borough president with respect to  land  located
      within  his  or  her  borough,  (5) a borough board with respect to land
      located within its borough, or (6) a community  board  with  respect  to
      land  located  within its community district. A community board, borough
      board or borough president that proposes any such plan shall submit  the
      plan  together  with  a  written  recommendation  to  the  city planning
      commission for determinations pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
      Any such submission may be made by a community board, borough  board  or
      borough  president  only  after the board or borough president proposing
      such a plan has held a public hearing on the plan.
        b. The city planning commission shall adopt rules establishing minimum
      standards for the form and content of plans  pursuant  to  this  section
      within  a  reasonable  time period after the first day of July, nineteen
      hundred ninety. Upon receipt of a plan proposed pursuant to this section
      by a community board, borough  board  or  borough  president,  the  city
      planning  commission  shall,  within a reasonable time period, determine
      whether such plan satisfies the standards established in such rules  and
      is  consistent  with sound planning policy. If the commission makes such
      determinations with respect to a plan submitted by a community board, it
      shall prepare or cause to be prepared any environmental analysis of such
      plan required by law to enable the  city  planning  commission  and  the
      council to act on the plan pursuant to subdivision d of this section. If
      the  city  planning  commission makes the determinations provided for in
      this subdivision with respect to a plan, such plan shall be referred  to
      the  department  of city planning for circulation and review pursuant to
      subdivisions c and d of this section.
        c. All plans proposed pursuant to this section shall  be  referred  to
      the department of city planning for circulation by the department to all
      affected  community boards, all affected borough boards and all affected
      borough presidents for review and written  recommendation,  except  that
      any  such  plan  need  not  be circulated to the agency or official that
      proposed such plan. All affected community boards and borough boards  to
      which  such  a  plan is referred shall hold a public hearing on any such
      plan, except that in the case of a plan that includes an entire  borough
      or  land  in more than one borough, only one public hearing need be held
      in each affected borough. The city planning commission  shall  establish
      by rule the procedures and schedule for review of such plans, consistent
      with  the provisions of this section. A community board or borough board
      may review a plan which does not involve land so located as  to  require
      its review if in its judgment the plan significantly affects the welfare
      of  the  district  or  borough served by such board. In such a case, the
      plan and any written recommendations  relative  thereto  shall  be  made
      available  to  such board on request. Such board may hold its own public
      hearing on such plan if it  desires  and  may  submit  its  own  written
      recommendations in regard thereto to the city planning commission.
        d. Within a reasonable time period following review and recommendation
      of  a  plan pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the city planning
      commission shall (1) review such plan, (2) hold a public hearing on such
      plan, and (3) by  resolution  approve,  approve  with  modifications  or
      disapprove  such plan. If the commission has approved a plan or approved
      a plan with modifications, such plan shall  be  subject  to  review  and
      action  by  the  council pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-d.
      The council may by a two-thirds vote  approve  a  plan  which  the  city
      planning commission disapproved or on which the commission has failed to
      act  if  the  mayor  so requests. Upon the filing by the mayor of such a
    
      request with the commission and the council, the commission shall within
      five days file with the council a copy of its decision together  with  a
      copy  of the plan. Copies of approved plans shall be filed with the city
      clerk, the department of city planning, the affected borough presidents,
      the affected borough boards and the affected community boards.
