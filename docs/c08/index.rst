Section 192. ::    
        
     
        §  192.  City planning commission. a.  There shall be a  city planning
      commission to consist of the chair and twelve other members.  The  mayor
      shall  appoint  the chair and   six other members of the commission, the
      public advocate shall appoint one member,  and  each  borough  president
      shall   appoint   one  member.    Members  shall  be  chosen  for  their
      independence, integrity and  civic  commitment.    Appointments  of  all
      members,  except  for  the  chair,  shall  be  subject to the advice and
      consent of the council.  For such appointments by officials  other  than
      the  mayor,  the  procedure  for obtaining the advice and consent of the
      council shall be the same as  the  procedure  provided  for  in  section
      thirty-one  for appointments by the mayor.  Except as otherwise provided
      in section one hundred ninety-one, no member shall hold any  other  city
      office.    Members other than the chair shall be appointed for a term of
      five years; provided, however, that of the members other than the chair,
      one member appointed by the mayor and one member appointed by a  borough
      president  shall serve for terms to expire on the thirtieth day of June,
      nineteen hundred ninety-one; one member appointed by the mayor  and  one
      member  appointed by a borough president shall serve for terms to expire
      on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred  ninety-two;  one  member
      appointed  by  the mayor and one member appointed by a borough president
      shall serve for terms to expire on the thirtieth day of  June,  nineteen
      hundred  ninety-three;  one member appointed by the mayor and one member
      appointed by a borough president shall serve for terms to expire on  the
      thirtieth  day  of  June,  nineteen hundred ninety-four; and two members
      appointed by the mayor, the member appointed by the public advocate  and
      one  member  appointed  by  a borough president shall serve for terms to
      expire on the thirtieth day of June, nineteen hundred ninety-five.   The
      borough  presidents  shall determine by lot the length of the term to be
      served by the member first appointed  by  each  borough  president.  The
      appointing   officials  shall  make  their  first  appointments  to  the
      commission on or before the first day of March, nineteen hundred ninety.
      The commission members so appointed shall assume office on the first day
      of July, nineteen hundred ninety.   Members of  the  commission    shall
      serve until their successors have been confirmed.  Any vacancy occurring
      other  than  by expiration of a term shall be filled by the official who
      appointed the member in the same manner as the original appointment.   A
      person so appointed shall serve for the unexpired portion of the term of
      the  member  succeeded.    Terms  shall begin on the next date after the
      expiration date of the preceding term.
        b.  Members, except for the chair, shall  not  be  considered  regular
      employees  of  the  city for purposes of chapter sixty-eight. The agency
      served by the members of the commission shall for  purposes  of  chapter
      sixty-eight  be  deemed  to be both the commission and the department of
      city planning. No member,  while  serving  as  a  member,  shall  appear
      directly  or  indirectly  before  the department, the commission, or any
      other city agency for which the conflicts of interest  board  shall,  by
      rule,  determine such appearance creates a conflict of interest with the
      duties and responsibilities of the member.  No firm in  which  a  member
      has  an interest may appear directly or indirectly before the department
      or commission.   For purposes  of  this  section,  the  terms  "agency,"
      "appear," "firm," and "interest" shall be defined as provided in chapter
      sixty-eight.
        c.  One of the members other than the chair shall be designated by the
      mayor as vice-chair and shall serve as vice-chair at the pleasure of the
      mayor. The vice-chair shall possess  the powers and perform  the  duties
      of  the  chair when the chair is absent or while a vacancy exists in the
      office of the chair, and shall at such times serve as director  of  city
      planning.
    
        d.   The city planning commission shall be responsible for the conduct
      of planning relating to  the  orderly  growth,  improvement  and  future
      development  of  the city, including  adequate and appropriate resources
      for the housing,  business,    industry,  transportation,  distribution,
      recreation,  culture,  comfort,  convenience,  health and welfare of its
      population.
        e. The city planning commission shall oversee implementation  of  laws
      that  require  environmental  reviews of actions taken by the city.  The
      commission shall establish by rule procedures for environmental  reviews
      of  proposed actions by the city where such reviews are required by law.
      Such rules shall include procedures for (1) selection of the city agency
      or agencies that  will  be  responsible  for    determining  whether  an
      environmental impact statement is required in connection with a proposed
      action and for  preparation and filing of any such statement required by
      law,  (2)  participation  by the city in environmental reviews involving
      agencies other than city agencies and (3) coordination of  environmental
      review  procedures with the land use review procedures set forth in this
      charter.  The director of city planning  and  the  commissioner  of  the
      department  of  environmental protection shall assign from the staffs of
      such departments an office of environmental  coordination,  which  shall
      provide   assistance   to   all   city   agencies  in  fulfilling  their
      environmental review responsibilities.
        f.  Not later than the thirty-first day of December, nineteen  hundred
      ninety-two  and  every  four years thereafter, the commission shall file
      with  the  mayor,  the  council,  the  public  advocate,   the   borough
      presidents,  and the community boards, a zoning and planning report. The
      report shall include (1) a statement  of  the  planning  policy  of  the
      commission,  which  policy  shall  take  into consideration, among other
      things, the ten-year capital strategy, the  four-year  capital  program,
      the  report on the social, economic and environmental health of the city
      issued pursuant to section  sixteen,  the  strategic  policy  statements
      provided for in section seventeen and plans approved pursuant to section
      one  hundred  ninety-seven-a, (2) a summary of the significant plans and
      studies completed or undertaken by the department of  city  planning  in
      the  preceding  four  years,  (3)  an  analysis of those portions of the
      zoning resolution that merit reconsideration in light  of  the  planning
      policy of the commission and (4) proposals for implementing the planning
      policy  of the commission whether by amendment of the zoning resolution,
      development of plans or otherwise.

      of  official  misconduct,  neglect  of  official  duties, conduct in any
      manner connected  with  his  or  her  official  duties  which  tends  to

Section 197-a. ::    
        
     
        §  197-a. Plans. a. Plans for the development, growth, and improvement
      of the city and of its boroughs and community districts may be  proposed
      by  (1)  the mayor, (2) the city planning commission, (3) the department
      of city planning, (4) a borough president with respect to  land  located
      within  his  or  her  borough,  (5) a borough board with respect to land
      located within its borough, or (6) a community  board  with  respect  to
      land  located  within its community district. A community board, borough
      board or borough president that proposes any such plan shall submit  the
      plan  together  with  a  written  recommendation  to  the  city planning
      commission for determinations pursuant to subdivision b of this section.
      Any such submission may be made by a community board, borough  board  or
      borough  president  only  after the board or borough president proposing
      such a plan has held a public hearing on the plan.
        b. The city planning commission shall adopt rules establishing minimum
      standards for the form and content of plans  pursuant  to  this  section
      within  a  reasonable  time period after the first day of July, nineteen
      hundred ninety. Upon receipt of a plan proposed pursuant to this section
      by a community board, borough  board  or  borough  president,  the  city
      planning  commission  shall,  within a reasonable time period, determine
      whether such plan satisfies the standards established in such rules  and
      is  consistent  with sound planning policy. If the commission makes such
      determinations with respect to a plan submitted by a community board, it
      shall prepare or cause to be prepared any environmental analysis of such
      plan required by law to enable the  city  planning  commission  and  the
      council to act on the plan pursuant to subdivision d of this section. If
      the  city  planning  commission makes the determinations provided for in
      this subdivision with respect to a plan, such plan shall be referred  to
      the  department  of city planning for circulation and review pursuant to
      subdivisions c and d of this section.
        c. All plans proposed pursuant to this section shall  be  referred  to
      the department of city planning for circulation by the department to all
      affected  community boards, all affected borough boards and all affected
      borough presidents for review and written  recommendation,  except  that
      any  such  plan  need  not  be circulated to the agency or official that
      proposed such plan. All affected community boards and borough boards  to
      which  such  a  plan is referred shall hold a public hearing on any such
      plan, except that in the case of a plan that includes an entire  borough
      or  land  in more than one borough, only one public hearing need be held
      in each affected borough. The city planning commission  shall  establish
      by rule the procedures and schedule for review of such plans, consistent
      with  the provisions of this section. A community board or borough board
      may review a plan which does not involve land so located as  to  require
      its review if in its judgment the plan significantly affects the welfare
      of  the  district  or  borough served by such board. In such a case, the
      plan and any written recommendations  relative  thereto  shall  be  made
      available  to  such board on request. Such board may hold its own public
      hearing on such plan if it  desires  and  may  submit  its  own  written
      recommendations in regard thereto to the city planning commission.
        d. Within a reasonable time period following review and recommendation
      of  a  plan pursuant to subdivision c of this section, the city planning
      commission shall (1) review such plan, (2) hold a public hearing on such
      plan, and (3) by  resolution  approve,  approve  with  modifications  or
      disapprove  such plan. If the commission has approved a plan or approved
      a plan with modifications, such plan shall  be  subject  to  review  and
      action  by  the  council pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-d.
      The council may by a two-thirds vote  approve  a  plan  which  the  city
      planning commission disapproved or on which the commission has failed to
      act  if  the  mayor  so requests. Upon the filing by the mayor of such a
    
      request with the commission and the council, the commission shall within
      five days file with the council a copy of its decision together  with  a
      copy  of the plan. Copies of approved plans shall be filed with the city
      clerk, the department of city planning, the affected borough presidents,
      the affected borough boards and the affected community boards.

      executed by an agency, a local development corporation or other  entity,
      that  relate  to  the private use or the disposition of city-owned land,
      shall be conveyed to the community boards where such land is located and
      the office of the borough president where such land is located  promptly
      after issuance or execution.

        b. The following documents shall be filed with the department of  city
      planning:    (1)  applications  under  this  section, (2) any amendments
      thereto that are made prior to approval of such applications pursuant to
      this chapter,  (3) any written information   submitted by  an  applicant

      community boards, or, if any affected community board shall fail to act,
      thirty  days after the expiration of the time allowed for such community
      board to act, the borough  board  may  hold  a  public  hearing  on  the
      application   and   any   such  recommendations  and  submit  a  written
      recommendation or waiver thereof to the city planning commission.
        g. Not later than thirty days after the filing of a recommendation  or
      waiver  with the borough president by all affected community boards, or,
      if any affected community board shall fail to act, thirty days after the
      expiration of the time allowed for such  community  board  to  act,  the
      borough  president  shall  submit  a  written  recommendation  or waiver
      thereof  to the city planning commission.
        h.  Not later than sixty days after expiration of time allowed for the
      filing of a recommendation or waiver with the city  planning  commission
      by  a  borough  president,  the  commission  shall approve, approve with
      modifications, or disapprove the application.    Any  such  approval  or
      approval   with  modifications  of  the  commission  shall  require  the
      affirmative vote of at least seven  of  the  members,  except  that  the
      affirmative vote of nine members shall be required to approve or approve
      with  modifications  an  application  pursuant to paragraph five, ten or
      eleven of subdivision a of this section relating to a new city  facility
      if  the  affected  borough president recommends against approval of such
      application pursuant to subdivision g of this section and  has  proposed
    
      an  alternative  location in the same borough for such new city facility
      pursuant to subdivision f or  g  of  section  two  hundred  four.    The
      commission  shall  conduct a public hearing on all applications that are
      subject  to  review  and  approval  by  the  commission pursuant to this
      section.  Prior to taking any action pursuant to this subdivision  on  a
      matter  involving  the  siting  of  a  capital project, the sale, lease,
      exchange or other disposition or acquisition of real property, a request
      for a proposal or other solicitation for  a  franchise  or  a  revocable
      consent,  the  city  planning  commission  may  obtain a report from the
      office  of  management  and  budget  or  the  department   of   citywide
      administrative  services,  as  appropriate.    Any  action  of  the city
      planning  commission   which   modifies   or   disapproves   a   written
      recommendation  of  the  community  board,  borough president or borough
      board shall be accompanied by a written explanation of  its  reason  for
      such action.
        i.  The  city  planning commission shall establish rules providing (1)
      guidelines, minimum standards, and procedural requirements for community
      boards, borough presidents, borough boards and  the  commission  in  the
      exercise  of their duties and responsibilities pursuant to this section,
      (2) minimum standards for  certification  of  applications  pursuant  to
      subdivision  c of this section, and (3) specific time periods for review
      of applications pursuant to this section prior to certification.
        j. If a community board, borough president or borough board  fails  or
      waives  its  right  to act within the time limits for review pursuant to
      subdivisions e, f and g  of  this  section,  the  application  shall  be
      referred  to  the next level of review.  If the city planning commission
      fails to act on an   application within  the  time  limit  specified  in
      subdivision  h  of this section, the application shall be deemed to have
      been denied unless the application (i) is pursuant to paragraph three or
      four of subdivision a of this section, in which case the application may
      be forwarded to the council for review pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      subdivision b of section two hundred, if applicable, or (ii) is pursuant
      to  paragraph  eight of subdivision a of this section, in which case the
      application shall be referred to the council for review  and  action  as
      provided by state law.
        k.  Notice  of  any  hearing  on  an  application by the city planning
      commission shall be published in the  City  Record  at  least  ten  days
      immediately  prior  to the date of the hearing, and a copy of the notice
      shall be mailed to all community boards or borough  boards  affected  by
      the application.
        l.  The  commission  shall  establish  by  rule procedures for advance
      posting of notices of commission hearings on applications. Such  notices
      shall  be posted at the location of the land involved in such manner and
      with respect to such types  of  applications  as  the  commission  deems
      appropriate.  Failure to post any such notice shall not affect or impair
      the validity of any  decision  of  the  city  planning  commission,  the
      council or other agency or official pursuant to this chapter.
        m.    A  community or borough board may review an application which is
      subject to the uniform land use  review  procedure    pursuant  to  this
      section  but does not involve land so located as to require reference to
      such board for review, if in the board's judgment the application  might
      significantly  affect  the  welfare of the community district or borough
      served by such board.  In such a case the application  and  the  related
      materials submitted to the affected board or boards by the city planning
      department  shall  be  submitted  also to such board upon the request of
      such board, and such board may hold its own public hearing thereon if it
      so desires and may submit its  own  written  recommendations  in  regard
    
      thereto  to  the  city planning commission for consideration at any time
      before the city planning commission takes action thereon.

      decision being filed.
        b.  The  following  decisions  filed  with  the  council  pursuant  to
      subdivision  a of this section, shall be subject to review and action by
      the council:
        (1) any decision of the city planning commission to approve or approve
      with modifications a matter described in paragraph  three  or  eight  of
      subdivision  a  of  section one hundred ninety-seven-c, a disposition of
      residential real property (as defined in  this  paragraph)  pursuant  to
      paragraph  ten  of  subdivision  a of section one hundred ninety-seven-c
      (except  for  dispositions  to  companies  that  have   been   organized
      exclusively  to  develop  housing projects for persons of low income), a
      plan pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-a, or a change in  the
      text  of  the  zoning resolution pursuant to sections two hundred or two
      hundred one.  For purposes of this section,  residential  real  property
      shall  mean  real  property  improved  by  structures,  whether  or  not
      occupied,  built  for  or  converted  to  a  use  which   is   primarily
      residential,  but  shall  not include property subsequently converted to
      non-residential use;  (2)  any  other  decision  of  the  city  planning
      commission  to  approve or approve with modifications a matter described
      in subdivision a of section one hundred ninety-seven-c, if (i)  both  an
      affected  community  board  (after  holding  a  public  hearing) and the
      affected borough president, within the time periods allotted  for  their
      reviews pursuant to section one hundred ninety-seven-c, have recommended
      in  writing  against  approval  and (ii) the affected borough president,
      within five days of receiving a copy of the decision of the  commission,
      files  with  the  commission  and the council a written objection to the
      decision; and
        (3) any other decision of the city planning commission to  approve  or
      approve  with  modifications  a  matter  described  in  subdivision a of
      section one hundred ninety-seven-c, if within twenty days of the  filing
      of  such decision pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the council
      resolves by the majority vote of all the council members to  review  the
      decision of the commission.
        c.  Within  fifty  days  of  the  filing  with the council pursuant to
      subdivision a of this section of  any  decision  of  the  city  planning
      commission which pursuant to subdivision b of this section is subject to
      review  by  the  council, the council shall hold a public hearing, after
      giving public notice not less than five days in advance of such hearing,
      and the council, within such fifty days, shall take final action on  the
      decision.  The affirmative vote of a majority of all the council members
      shall be required to approve, approve with modifications  or  disapprove
      such  a  decision.  If,  within  the  time  period  provided for in this
      subdivision and, if applicable, in subdivision d of  this  section,  the
      council  fails to act or fails to act by the required vote on a decision
      of the city planning commission subject to council  review  pursuant  to
      subdivision  b  of  this  section,  the  council shall be deemed to have
      approved the decision of the commission.
    
        d. The council shall  not  approve  with  modifications  a  commission
      decision  if  the commission has determined pursuant to this subdivision
      that additional review  of  the  modifications  is  required.  Prior  to
      approving  a  decision of the commission with modifications, the council
      shall  file  the  text  of  any  such  proposed  modifications  with the
      commission. Within fifteen days of such  filing,  the  commission  shall
      file  with  the  council  a  written  statement  indicating whether such
      proposed modifications are of such significance that  additional  review
      of  environmental  issues  or  additional review pursuant to section one
      hundred ninety-seven-c is required. If no additional review is required,
      the commission may include in such statement its advisory recommendation
      concerning  the  proposed  modifications,  together  with  any  proposed
      amendments  to  the  proposed  modifications. The council may thereafter
      approve such proposed modifications,  with  or  without  the  amendments
      proposed  by the commission. The time period for council action shall be
      tolled during such fifteen-day period; provided, however, that  proposed
      modifications  may  be  referred  to  the  commission  pursuant  to this
      subdivision only once with respect  to  each  application  or  group  of
      related applications under review by the council.
        e.  All actions of the council pursuant to this section shall be filed
      by the council with the mayor prior to the expiration of the time period
      for council action under subdivisions c and, if applicable,  d  of  this
      section.  Actions of the council pursuant to this section shall be final
      unless the mayor within five days of receiving a filing with respect  to
      such  an  action  of  the  council  files  with  the  council  a written
      disapproval  of  the  action.  Any  mayoral   disapproval   under   this
      subdivision shall be subject to override by a two-thirds vote of all the
      council members within ten days of such filing by the mayor.
        f. The mayor shall have the right to file a written disapproval of any
      approval  deemed  to  have  occurred  pursuant  to subdivision c of this
      section as a result of a failure of the council to act or to act by  the
      required  vote.  Any  such written disapproval must be filed within five
      days of the expiration of the time period  for  action  by  the  council
      under  subdivisions c and, if applicable, d of this section. Any mayoral
      disapproval under this subdivision shall be subject  to  override  by  a
      two-thirds  vote  of  all  the  council  members within ten days of such
      filing by the mayor.
        g. If a decision of the commission approving  an  application  is  not
      subject  to council review pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision b of
      this section or is not  made  subject  to  council  review  pursuant  to
      paragraphs  two or three of subdivision b of this section, the mayor may
      nonetheless file with the council a written objection to  such  decision
      of  the  commission  within  five days of the expiration of time for the
      council to act under paragraph three of subdivision b of  this  section.
      Any  mayoral  objection  under  this  subdivision  shall  be  subject to
      override by a two-thirds vote of all the council members within ten days
      of such filing by the mayor.

      resolutions or regulations in harmony with  their  general  purpose  and
      intent  and  in  accordance  with general or specific rules contained in

      time or upon application as provided in section two hundred one, adopt a
      resolution to amend the text of the zoning  resolution  subject  to  the
      limitations  provided  by  law. Before adopting any such resolution, the

        2.  Any resolution by the commission approving a change in the text of
      the zoning resolution shall be subject to review  and  approval  by  the
      council  pursuant  to section one hundred ninety-seven-d. Any resolution
      for a zoning text change which the mayor shall  have  certified  to  the

      approval by the council.
        3. In case a protest against such a resolution approved  by  the  city

      delivery of existing facilities.   The criteria shall   be  designed  to
      further  the  fair  distribution  among  communities  of the burdens and
      benefits associated with  city  facilities,  consistent  with  community
      needs for services and efficient and cost effective delivery of services
      and  with  due  regard  for  the  social  and  economic  impacts of such
      facilities upon the areas surrounding the sites.  Not later than  thirty

        §  204.  Citywide  statement of needs. a. Each year not later than the
      fifteenth day of November,  the  mayor  shall  submit  to  the  council,
      borough  presidents,  borough  boards  and  community  boards a citywide
      statement of needs concerning city  facilities  prepared  in  accordance
      with  the  criteria  established  pursuant to section two hundred three.
      Copies of the statement shall also be made available to  the  public  in
      the  main  branch  of  the public library in each borough. The statement
      shall identify by agency and program: (1) all new  city  facilities  and
      all  significant expansions of city facilities for which the mayor or an
      agency intends to make or propose an expenditure or to select or propose
      a site during the ensuing two fiscal years and (2) all  city  facilities
      which  the  city plans to close or to reduce significantly in size or in
      capacity for service delivery during the ensuing two fiscal years.
        b. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  one  of
      subdivision a of this section, the statement of needs shall describe for
      each proposed new city facility or significant expansion: (1) the public
      purpose  to  be served thereby, (2) the size and nature of the facility,
      (3) the proposed location by borough and, if practicable,  by  community
      district  or group of community districts, and (4) the specific criteria
      to be used in locating the new facility or expansion.
        c. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  two  of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section, the statement of needs shall describe
      with respect to each such  city  facility:  (1)  the  reasons  for  such
      proposed  closing  or  reduction, (2) the location, and (3) the specific
      criteria for selecting the city facility for closure or for reduction in
      size or capacity for service delivery.
        d. The statement of needs shall be accompanied by a map together  with
      explanatory  text,  indicating  (1)  the location and current use of all
      city-owned real property, (2) all  final  commitments  relating  to  the
      disposition  or  future  use  of  city-owned  real  property,  including
      assignments  by  the  department  of  citywide  administrative  services
      pursuant  to  clause  b  of subdivision three of section sixteen hundred
      two, and (3) to the extent such information is available  to  the  city,
      (i) the location of health and social service facilities operated by the
      state  of  New  York  or  the  federal government or pursuant to written
      agreement on behalf of the state or the federal government; and (ii) the
      location of transportation or waste management  facilities  operated  by
      public  entities  or  by private entities pursuant to written agreements
      with  public  entities,  or  by  other  private  entities  that  provide
      comparable services. Information which can be presented most effectively
      in  text  may  be  presented  in  this  manner.  In  addition  to  being
      transmitted with the statement of needs pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
      this section, such map shall be kept on file with the department of city
      planning  and  shall be available for public inspection and copying. The
      map shall be updated on at least an annual basis.
        e. Preparation of the statement of needs. (1) Annually on such date as
      the mayor shall  direct,  each  agency  shall  submit  to  the  mayor  a
      statement  containing all the information required to be included in the
      statement of  needs  for  the  ensuing  two  fiscal  years  pursuant  to
      subdivisions  a,  b  and  c  of  this section that relates to the plans,
      jurisdiction and responsibility of such agency. Such statements shall be
      known as the departmental statements of need  for  city  facilities.  In
      preparing  such  departmental  statements  of  needs,  each agency shall
      review and consider the district needs statements submitted by community
      boards pursuant to paragraph ten of  subdivision  d  of  section  twenty
      eight  hundred  and the statements of budget priorities submitted by the
      community boards pursuant to section two hundred thirty.
    
        (2) The mayor, assisted  by  the  department  of  city  planning,  the
      department  of  design  and  construction and the department of citywide
      administrative services, shall review such  departmental  statements  of
      need  and  use  them to prepare the statement of needs. In preparing the
      statement  of  needs,  the  mayor  shall  apply the criteria established
      pursuant to section two hundred three.
        f. Upon receipt of the statement of needs pursuant to subdivision a of
      this section, each community board and borough  president  shall  review
      the statement of needs. Each community board shall make the statement of
      needs  available  to  the  public  and  conduct  a public hearing on the
      statement of needs. Each community board  and  borough  president  shall
      have  the  right  to  submit  comments  on the statement of needs to the
      department of city  planning  within  ninety  days  of  receipt  of  the
      statement.  Each  borough  president shall have the right, within ninety
      days of receipt of the statement of needs, to submit a written statement
      to the mayor proposing locations for  any  new  city  facilities  to  be
      located  in  his  or her borough pursuant to the statement of needs. All
      such locations proposed by a borough president shall be located  in  his
      or  her borough and shall be certified by the borough president as being
      consistent  with  the  specific  criteria  for  the  location  of   city
      facilities  contained  in  the  statement of needs and with the criteria
      established pursuant to section two  hundred  three.  Each  city  agency
      shall consider such written statements in taking actions with respect to
      matters included in the statement of needs.
        g.  Whenever an application involving a new city facility is submitted
      to the department of city planning pursuant to paragraph  five,  ten  or
      eleven  of  subdivision  a  of  section  one hundred ninety-seven-c, the
      applicant shall include as part of the application a  statement  of  (1)
      how  the proposed action satisfies the criteria for the location of city
      facilities established  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred  three,  (2)
      whether the proposed action is consistent with the most recent statement
      of  needs,  and  (3)  whether the proposed action is consistent with any
      written statements or  comments  submitted  by  borough  presidents  and
      community  boards in response to the statement of needs. If the proposed
      action is  not  consistent  with  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
      facilities,  the  statement  of needs, or any such written statements or
      comments submitted in response to the statement  of  needs,  the  agency
      shall  include as part of its application a statement of the reasons for
      any such inconsistencies. If the proposed new facility is  not  referred
      to in the statement of needs, the applicant shall submit to the affected
      borough  president  a  description of the public purpose to be served by
      the city facility, its proposed location,  the  appropriation  (if  any)
      that the agency intends to use in connection with the facility, the size
      and nature of the facility and the specific criteria for the location of
      the  facility.  The  affected  borough  president  shall have the right,
      within thirty days of the submission of such description, to propose  an
      alternative  location  in  his  or  her  borough  for  the proposed city
      facility, provided that the borough president  shall  certify  that  the
      alternative  location  satisfies  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
      facilities under section two hundred three and the specific criteria for
      locating the facility in the statement of needs. The application for the
      proposed  site  selection,  disposition  or  acquisition  shall  not  be
      certified  and  shall  not  be  reviewed pursuant to section one hundred
      ninety-seven-c until at least thirty days after the submission  of  such
      information  to  the affected borough president. A borough president may
      elect to waive the right to such thirty-day review period.
        h. The mayor's management report, prepared pursuant to section twelve,
      shall include a review of the implementation of the statement of  needs.
    
      Such  review  shall consist of (1) a list of the proposed actions in the
      statement of needs that have been  implemented  and  of  those  proposed
      actions  that  have  not  been  implemented and (2) a description of the
      proposed  actions  in the statement of needs which have been implemented
      in a manner significantly  different  from  what  was  proposed  in  the
      statement of needs and the reasons therefor.
