Chapter 1: Department of Correction
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 9-101 City correctional institutions.* ::


The commissioner of correction may designate any institution or part thereof under the jurisdiction of the commissioner for the safekeeping of persons committed to the department of correction. The commissioner may also designate any institution or part thereof under his or her jurisdiction for the safekeeping of female prisoners only. Officers charged with the transportation of persons committed to the department of correction shall deliver them to the institution or part thereof as may be directed by the commissioner.






*§ 9-102 Buildings for common jails.* ::


The board of estimate by resolution may designate from time to time any building or buildings within the city to be the common jails of such city or of any of the counties therein. The building or buildings so designated shall be such common jails until changed by a like resolution of such board.






*§ 9-103 Segregation of prisoners on Hart's Island.* ::


The lands and buildings on Hart's Island shall be utilized for the segregation of prisoners transferred thereto by the commissioner of correction.






*§ 9-104 Transfer of inmates by commissioner of correction.* ::


The commissioner of correction shall have power to transfer prisoners from any prison or correctional institution under his or her control to any other prison or correctional institution under the jurisdiction of the department.






*§ 9-105 Commitment of witnesses in criminal proceedings.* ::


The commissioner of correction shall have authority concerning the care and custody of witnesses in criminal proceedings committed to the institutions under the commissioner's charge. Upon the recommendation of the district attorney, the commissioner of correction may transfer such witnesses from one institution under the commissioner's charge to another such institution.






*§ 9-106 Legislative intent; narcotics treatment program.* ::


The charter empowers the council as the legislative body of the city of New York to pass laws "for the order, protection and government of persons and property; for the preservation of the public health, comfort, peace and prosperity of the city and its inhabitants." One of the major problems facing New York today, and one which involves almost every one of the above enumerated powers is the narcotics problem. There has been no abatement in the seriously burgeoning scourge of narcotic addiction in New York city despite the nineteen hundred sixty-two White House conference on narcotics and drug abuses and the nineteen hundred sixty-five Gracie Mansion conference on narcotics addiction, the enactment and administration of article nine of the mental hygiene law, and the various legislative expressions of interest and concern on federal, state and city levels. It has also been adequately demonstrated that the incarceration of an addict after an arrest and trial without a specific modality of medical and/or social therapy, even with the involvement of multi-million dollar expense and capital funding, offers no solution to the problem and even the establishment of many so-called "half-way houses" dealing with after-care and the social needs of the drug addict have failed. Sufficient studies have been made to determine that a program of treatment which blocks out the craving, narcotic hunger and euphoria associated with heroin is successful and by giving maintenance dosages of methadone hydrochloride as a complete substitute for heroin, we can start to drive down the rate of narcotics addiction in our city. Between December nineteen hundred sixty-seven and April nineteen hundred sixty-eight, the city prison at Rikers Island, was used for a demonstration project for the use of methadone hydrochloride to combat heroin addiction. This voluntary program involved twelve hard core, intractable, recidivist addicts, with multiple arrest and long conviction records and it achieved remarkable results. One of the conclusions of the final report of this demonstration project reveals that a large number of the four thousand to five thousand addict prisoners would be willing to accept methadone maintenance treatment if it were available. The applicants for interviews in the prison were so numerous that all could not be interviewed. Letters from prisoners still continue to arrive requesting treatment. Despite the demonstrated success of the program, it is being abandoned. The final report reflects the reason for not continuing and expanding the program to realistic dimensions; that reason is the unavailability of funds. This conclusion is difficult to comprehend in view of the multi-million dollar funding of other programs, which have neither revealed any new solutions nor have they demonstrated any degree of achievement. It is not anticipated that this legislation will solve the problem. Hopefully, it will reverse the ever mounting spiral of heroin addiction.






*§ 9-107 Narcotics treatment program.* ::


a. The commissioner of correction shall establish a program for the treatment of heroin addicts through the use of methadone hydrochloride therapy. The program shall be available on a voluntary basis only to such inmates as apply, subject to a medical evaluation, before acceptance, of their need for such treatment.

b. The commissioner of correction shall provide for the continuance of such treatment by establishing parole procedures and after-care evaluation and implementation after the incarceration has terminated, during the period of parole.






*§ 9-108 Health services.* ::


The New York city health and hospital corporation shall arrange for and make available facilities for outpatient treatment and suitable amenities for the continuance of social therapy for all persons who have received such treatment in conformance with section 9-107 of this code. Such continued treatment shall be voluntary, and shall commence upon the discharge of such persons from any penal institution and/or upon the termination of any period of parole.






*§ 9-109 Classification.* ::


The commissioner of correction shall so far as practicable classify all felons, misdemeanants and violators of local laws under the commissioner's charge, so that the youthful or less hardened offenders shall be segregated from the older or more hardened offenders. The commissioner of correction may set apart one or more of the penal institutions for the custody of such youthful or less hardened offenders, and he or she is empowered to transfer such offenders thereto from any penal institution of the city. The commissioner of correction is empowered to classify the transferred inmates, so far as practicable, with regard to age, nature of offense, or other fact, and to separate or group such offenders according to such classification.






*§ 9-110 Education and programming.* ::


The commissioner of correction may establish and maintain schools or classes for the instruction and training of the inmates of any institution under the commissioner's charge, and shall offer to all inmates incarcerated for more than 10 days a minimum of five hours per day of inmate programming or education, excluding weekends and holidays. Such programming or education may be provided by the department or by another provider, and need not be offered to inmates in punitive segregation, or to inmates who may be ineligible or unavailable for such programming or education, or where offering such programming or education would not be consistent with the safety of the inmate, staff or facility. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the department from offering such programming or education on the basis of incentive-based criteria developed by the department. For the purposes of this section, the term “inmate programming” has the same meaning as in section 9-144.








*§ 9-111 Libraries.* ::


a. The commissioner of correction is empowered to set aside in the city prison a sufficient space for the purposes of installing a library for the inmates. The commissioner of correction may do likewise in any other place in which persons are held for infractions of the law pending a determination by a court.

b. The commissioner of correction is authorized to accept contributions of books, pamphlets and periodicals. All such contributions shall be recorded and catalogued; an account thereof shall be kept and a report concerning the same shall be made to the commissioner of correction at least once in each calendar year.






*§ 9-112 Suspension of members of the uniformed force.* ::


Where a member of the uniformed force shall be charged with the commission of a crime, he or she may be suspended without pay for the duration of the time that said criminal charges are pending final disposition. If the member is found not guilty of such criminal charges he or she shall be paid full back pay for the period of suspension. However, after the final disposition of said criminal charges no member of the uniformed force shall be suspended without pay for more than thirty days while awaiting disposition of departmental charges against such member. If the member is found not guilty of the departmental charges such member shall be paid full back pay for the period he or she had been suspended while awaiting disposition of the departmental charges against such member. In the event an award of back pay is made pursuant to this section, the amount of any salary or income earned by the member of the uniformed force during the period of suspension shall be deducted from the award.






*§ 9-113 Resignation by members of the uniformed force of the department of correction.* ::


Absence, without leave and without an explanation, of any member of the force for five consecutive work days shall be deemed and held to be a resignation, and the member so absent shall, at the expiration of such period, cease to be a member of the force and be dismissed therefrom.






*§ 9-114 Discipline of inmates.* ::


a. Officers in any institution in the department of correction shall use all suitable means to defend themselves, to enforce discipline, and to secure the persons of inmates who shall:

   2. Wilfully violate the rules and regulations established by the commissioner of correction.

At least one woman correction officer shall be on duty in each prison as long as any female prisoner is detained therein.

b. Women correction officers shall search all women visiting any part of such prisons, except as otherwise ordered by the commissioner. Only women correction officers shall be admitted to the corridor or cells of the female prisoners without the consent of the officer in charge of the prison.

   1. Custodial officer shall mean and include any and all correction officers (male), any and all captains, any and all correction officers (female), and any and all supervising correction officers (female). For the purposes of this section each of the titles enumerated herein shall constitute a single employee classification.

   2. Working cycle shall mean and include that period of time within which each custodial officer in an employee classification at an institution shall be assigned to the same number of each of the normal tours of duty. Working cycles may vary as between institutions, and may vary as to the different employee classifications in the same or different institutions, but in no case may a working cycle exceed one calendar year in duration.

b. The commissioner of correction or other officer or officers having the management, control or direction of the department of correction shall divide all the custodial officers in each employee classification into three platoons at each institution. No one of such platoons nor any member thereof shall be assigned to more than one tour of duty, to consist of not more than ten consecutive hours in each consecutive twenty-four hours, excepting only that in the event of riots, prison breaks or other similar emergencies, so many of said platoons or of the members thereof as may be necessary, may be continued on duty for such hours as may be necessary. For the purpose of changing tours of duty and for the necessary time consumed therein, said platoons or members thereof shall be continued on duty until relieved.

c. Tours of duty shall commence at midnight, eight o'clock ante meridian and four o'clock post meridian of each consecutive twenty-four hours. Such tours of duty shall hereinafter be designated as normal tours of duty. At the discretion of the warden or other officer or officers in charge of an institution, other tours of duty may be created. Such tours of duty shall hereinafter be designated as miscellaneous tours of duty. Within each complete working cycle at each institution, every custodial officer in the same employee classification shall be assigned to the same number of each of the normal tours of duty. For the purpose of such assignment of normal tours of duty as hereinbefore prescribed, miscellaneous tours of duty which commence at or after seven o'clock ante meridian and at or before eleven o'clock ante meridian shall be considered to be a part of that normal tour of duty which commences at eight o'clock ante meridian; miscellaneous tours of duty which commence after eleven o'clock ante meridian and before eight o'clock post meridian shall be considered to be a part of that normal tour of duty which commences at four o'clock post meridian; miscellaneous tours of duty which commence at or after eight o'clock post meridian and before seven o'clock ante meridian shall be considered to be a part of that normal tour of duty which commences at midnight.

Every member of each platoon shall be entitled to at least one calendar day of rest upon the completion of every six tours of duty. This day of rest shall not be deferred longer than one calendar week after such member has become entitled thereto. None of the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply to or govern the rotation of tours of duty of custodial officers who may be detailed or assigned to an institution wherein no inmates are detained overnight. Where in any single institution the total number of custodial officers in any single employee classification is less than four in number, none of the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply to or govern the rotation of tours of duty of members of such employee classification in said institution. None of the foregoing provisions of this section shall apply to or govern the rotation of tours of duty of custodial officers who may be detailed or assigned to what shall hereinafter be known and designated as the special duty squad at each institution, provided, however, that the number of custodial officers detailed or assigned to a special duty squad at any single institution may not exceed twenty-five per centum of the total number of custodial officers employed at the said institution; provided, however, that custodial officers detailed or assigned to special duty squads may be assigned only to that normal tour of duty commencing at eight o'clock ante meridian, or to miscellaneous tours of duty constituting a part of such normal tour of duty; and provided further, however, that throughout the department of correction the total number of custodial officers detailed or assigned to steady tours of duty, whether as members of special duty squads or otherwise, shall not exceed fifteen per centum of the total number of custodial officers employed in the department of correction. None of the foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall apply to or govern the rotation of tours of duty of custodial officers who may be detailed or assigned to steady tours of duty for reasons of management efficiency, which reasons shall presumptively include the subdivision of a facility and/or unit into smaller units of manage- ment.

d. All custodial officers shall be allowed a vacation period as may be authorized in leave regulations promulgated by the mayor. During an emergency, as defined herein, the vacation period may be withheld for such length of time as may be necessary. Upon cessation of such emergency each of such custodial officers from whom a vacation or a portion of a vacation shall have been withheld during such emergency, shall receive within six months from such cessation a leave of absence with pay commensurate with the number of days of such vacation withheld.
