        §  204.  Citywide  statement of needs. a. Each year not later than the
      fifteenth day of November,  the  mayor  shall  submit  to  the  council,
      borough  presidents,  borough  boards  and  community  boards a citywide
      statement of needs concerning city  facilities  prepared  in  accordance
      with  the  criteria  established  pursuant to section two hundred three.
      Copies of the statement shall also be made available to  the  public  in
      the  main  branch  of  the public library in each borough. The statement
      shall identify by agency and program: (1) all new  city  facilities  and
      all  significant expansions of city facilities for which the mayor or an
      agency intends to make or propose an expenditure or to select or propose
      a site during the ensuing two fiscal years and (2) all  city  facilities
      which  the  city plans to close or to reduce significantly in size or in
      capacity for service delivery during the ensuing two fiscal years.
        b. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  one  of
      subdivision a of this section, the statement of needs shall describe for
      each proposed new city facility or significant expansion: (1) the public
      purpose  to  be served thereby, (2) the size and nature of the facility,
      (3) the proposed location by borough and, if practicable,  by  community
      district  or group of community districts, and (4) the specific criteria
      to be used in locating the new facility or expansion.
        c. With respect to the city facilities referred to in  clause  two  of
      subdivision  a  of  this  section, the statement of needs shall describe
      with respect to each such  city  facility:  (1)  the  reasons  for  such
      proposed  closing  or  reduction, (2) the location, and (3) the specific
      criteria for selecting the city facility for closure or for reduction in
      size or capacity for service delivery.
        d. The statement of needs shall be accompanied by a map together  with
      explanatory  text,  indicating  (1)  the location and current use of all
      city-owned real property, (2) all  final  commitments  relating  to  the
      disposition  or  future  use  of  city-owned  real  property,  including
      assignments  by  the  department  of  citywide  administrative  services
      pursuant  to  clause  b  of subdivision three of section sixteen hundred
      two, and (3) to the extent such information is available  to  the  city,
      (i) the location of health and social service facilities operated by the
      state  of  New  York  or  the  federal government or pursuant to written
      agreement on behalf of the state or the federal government; and (ii) the
      location of transportation or waste management  facilities  operated  by
      public  entities  or  by private entities pursuant to written agreements
      with  public  entities,  or  by  other  private  entities  that  provide
      comparable services. Information which can be presented most effectively
      in  text  may  be  presented  in  this  manner.  In  addition  to  being
      transmitted with the statement of needs pursuant  to  subdivision  a  of
      this section, such map shall be kept on file with the department of city
      planning  and  shall be available for public inspection and copying. The
      map shall be updated on at least an annual basis.
        e. Preparation of the statement of needs. (1) Annually on such date as
      the mayor shall  direct,  each  agency  shall  submit  to  the  mayor  a
      statement  containing all the information required to be included in the
      statement of  needs  for  the  ensuing  two  fiscal  years  pursuant  to
      subdivisions  a,  b  and  c  of  this section that relates to the plans,
      jurisdiction and responsibility of such agency. Such statements shall be
      known as the departmental statements of need  for  city  facilities.  In
      preparing  such  departmental  statements  of  needs,  each agency shall
      review and consider the district needs statements submitted by community
      boards pursuant to paragraph ten of  subdivision  d  of  section  twenty
      eight  hundred  and the statements of budget priorities submitted by the
      community boards pursuant to section two hundred thirty.
    
        (2) The mayor, assisted  by  the  department  of  city  planning,  the
      department  of  design  and  construction and the department of citywide
      administrative services, shall review such  departmental  statements  of
      need  and  use  them to prepare the statement of needs. In preparing the
      statement  of  needs,  the  mayor  shall  apply the criteria established
      pursuant to section two hundred three.
        f. Upon receipt of the statement of needs pursuant to subdivision a of
      this section, each community board and borough  president  shall  review
      the statement of needs. Each community board shall make the statement of
      needs  available  to  the  public  and  conduct  a public hearing on the
      statement of needs. Each community board  and  borough  president  shall
      have  the  right  to  submit  comments  on the statement of needs to the
      department of city  planning  within  ninety  days  of  receipt  of  the
      statement.  Each  borough  president shall have the right, within ninety
      days of receipt of the statement of needs, to submit a written statement
      to the mayor proposing locations for  any  new  city  facilities  to  be
      located  in  his  or her borough pursuant to the statement of needs. All
      such locations proposed by a borough president shall be located  in  his
      or  her borough and shall be certified by the borough president as being
      consistent  with  the  specific  criteria  for  the  location  of   city
      facilities  contained  in  the  statement of needs and with the criteria
      established pursuant to section two  hundred  three.  Each  city  agency
      shall consider such written statements in taking actions with respect to
      matters included in the statement of needs.
        g.  Whenever an application involving a new city facility is submitted
      to the department of city planning pursuant to paragraph  five,  ten  or
      eleven  of  subdivision  a  of  section  one hundred ninety-seven-c, the
      applicant shall include as part of the application a  statement  of  (1)
      how  the proposed action satisfies the criteria for the location of city
      facilities established  pursuant  to  section  two  hundred  three,  (2)
      whether the proposed action is consistent with the most recent statement
      of  needs,  and  (3)  whether the proposed action is consistent with any
      written statements or  comments  submitted  by  borough  presidents  and
      community  boards in response to the statement of needs. If the proposed
      action is  not  consistent  with  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
      facilities,  the  statement  of needs, or any such written statements or
      comments submitted in response to the statement  of  needs,  the  agency
      shall  include as part of its application a statement of the reasons for
      any such inconsistencies. If the proposed new facility is  not  referred
      to in the statement of needs, the applicant shall submit to the affected
      borough  president  a  description of the public purpose to be served by
      the city facility, its proposed location,  the  appropriation  (if  any)
      that the agency intends to use in connection with the facility, the size
      and nature of the facility and the specific criteria for the location of
      the  facility.  The  affected  borough  president  shall have the right,
      within thirty days of the submission of such description, to propose  an
      alternative  location  in  his  or  her  borough  for  the proposed city
      facility, provided that the borough president  shall  certify  that  the
      alternative  location  satisfies  the  criteria  for  location  of  city
      facilities under section two hundred three and the specific criteria for
      locating the facility in the statement of needs. The application for the
      proposed  site  selection,  disposition  or  acquisition  shall  not  be
      certified  and  shall  not  be  reviewed pursuant to section one hundred
      ninety-seven-c until at least thirty days after the submission  of  such
      information  to  the affected borough president. A borough president may
      elect to waive the right to such thirty-day review period.
        h. The mayor's management report, prepared pursuant to section twelve,
      shall include a review of the implementation of the statement of  needs.
    
      Such  review  shall consist of (1) a list of the proposed actions in the
      statement of needs that have been  implemented  and  of  those  proposed
      actions  that  have  not  been  implemented and (2) a description of the
      proposed  actions  in the statement of needs which have been implemented
      in a manner significantly  different  from  what  was  proposed  in  the
      statement of needs and the reasons therefor.
