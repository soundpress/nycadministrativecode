      define  or  substantially  redefine  the  overall  scope of issues to be
      addressed in  any draft environmental impact statement required by  law.
      The department of city planning shall forward a copy of any materials it
      receives  pursuant  to  this  subdivision (whether or not such materials

        c. The department of city planning shall be responsible for certifying
      that applications pursuant to subdivision a of this section are complete
      and  ready  to  proceed  through  the  uniform land use review procedure
      provided for in this section.  Upon certification of an application, the
      department shall give notice of such certification to the council.    If
    
      an  application  under  this  section  has not been certified within six
      months after filing, both the applicant and, if the land use proposed in
      an application is consistent with  the  land  use  policy  or  strategic
      policy statement of the affected borough president, the affected borough

      city planning  commission  for  certification.    The  commission  shall
      promptly,  but  in  any event within sixty days of the filing of such an
      appeal, either certify the application or state in writing what  further
      information  is    necessary  to  complete the application.   If such an
      appeal is brought by an affected borough president, the affirmative vote
      of five members of the commission shall be  sufficient  to  certify  the
      application.
        d.  If  a meeting involving a city agency and an applicant is convened
      to define or substantially redefine the  overall scope of issues  to  be
      addressed  in  any  draft environmental impact statement required by law
      for an  application subject to review under this section, each  affected
      community  board  and  each  affected  borough  president  shall receive
      advance notice of such meeting, and each shall have the  right  to  send
      one representative to the meeting.
        e.  Each  affected  community  board  shall, not later than sixty days
      after receipt of an application that  has  been  certified  pursuant  to
      subdivision  c of this section,
        (1)  notify the public of the application in a manner specified by the
      city planning commission pursuant to subdivision i of this section, and
        (2) either (a) conduct a public hearing thereon and prepare and submit
      a written recommendation directly to the city planning commission and to
      the affected borough president or (b) where authorized by this  charter,
      submit  a written waiver of the right to conduct a public hearing and to
      submit such written recommendations to the commission and  the  affected
      borough president.
        f.  A copy of a recommendation or waiver by a community board pursuant
      to subdivision e of this section that involves land located  within  two
      or  more  community  districts in a borough shall also be filed with the
      affected borough board within the  same  time  period  as  specified  in
      subdivision  e.    Not  later  than  thirty  days  after the filing of a
      recommendation  or  waiver  with  the  borough  board  by  all  affected
      community boards, or, if any affected community board shall fail to act,
      thirty  days after the expiration of the time allowed for such community
      board to act, the borough  board  may  hold  a  public  hearing  on  the
      application   and   any   such  recommendations  and  submit  a  written
      recommendation or waiver thereof to the city planning commission.
        g. Not later than thirty days after the filing of a recommendation  or
      waiver  with the borough president by all affected community boards, or,
      if any affected community board shall fail to act, thirty days after the
      expiration of the time allowed for such  community  board  to  act,  the
      borough  president  shall  submit  a  written  recommendation  or waiver
      thereof  to the city planning commission.
        h.  Not later than sixty days after expiration of time allowed for the
      filing of a recommendation or waiver with the city  planning  commission
      by  a  borough  president,  the  commission  shall approve, approve with
      modifications, or disapprove the application.    Any  such  approval  or
      approval   with  modifications  of  the  commission  shall  require  the
      affirmative vote of at least seven  of  the  members,  except  that  the
      affirmative vote of nine members shall be required to approve or approve
      with  modifications  an  application  pursuant to paragraph five, ten or
      eleven of subdivision a of this section relating to a new city  facility
      if  the  affected  borough president recommends against approval of such
      application pursuant to subdivision g of this section and  has  proposed
    
      an  alternative  location in the same borough for such new city facility
      pursuant to subdivision f or  g  of  section  two  hundred  four.    The
      commission  shall  conduct a public hearing on all applications that are
      subject  to  review  and  approval  by  the  commission pursuant to this
      section.  Prior to taking any action pursuant to this subdivision  on  a
      matter  involving  the  siting  of  a  capital project, the sale, lease,
      exchange or other disposition or acquisition of real property, a request
      for a proposal or other solicitation for  a  franchise  or  a  revocable
      consent,  the  city  planning  commission  may  obtain a report from the
      office  of  management  and  budget  or  the  department   of   citywide
      administrative  services,  as  appropriate.    Any  action  of  the city
      planning  commission   which   modifies   or   disapproves   a   written
      recommendation  of  the  community  board,  borough president or borough
      board shall be accompanied by a written explanation of  its  reason  for
      such action.
        i.  The  city  planning commission shall establish rules providing (1)
      guidelines, minimum standards, and procedural requirements for community
      boards, borough presidents, borough boards and  the  commission  in  the
      exercise  of their duties and responsibilities pursuant to this section,
      (2) minimum standards for  certification  of  applications  pursuant  to
      subdivision  c of this section, and (3) specific time periods for review
      of applications pursuant to this section prior to certification.
        j. If a community board, borough president or borough board  fails  or
      waives  its  right  to act within the time limits for review pursuant to
      subdivisions e, f and g  of  this  section,  the  application  shall  be
      referred  to  the next level of review.  If the city planning commission
      fails to act on an   application within  the  time  limit  specified  in
      subdivision  h  of this section, the application shall be deemed to have
      been denied unless the application (i) is pursuant to paragraph three or
      four of subdivision a of this section, in which case the application may
      be forwarded to the council for review pursuant  to  the  provisions  of
      subdivision b of section two hundred, if applicable, or (ii) is pursuant
      to  paragraph  eight of subdivision a of this section, in which case the
      application shall be referred to the council for review  and  action  as
      provided by state law.
        k.  Notice  of  any  hearing  on  an  application by the city planning
      commission shall be published in the  City  Record  at  least  ten  days
      immediately  prior  to the date of the hearing, and a copy of the notice
      shall be mailed to all community boards or borough  boards  affected  by
      the application.
        l.  The  commission  shall  establish  by  rule procedures for advance
      posting of notices of commission hearings on applications. Such  notices
      shall  be posted at the location of the land involved in such manner and
      with respect to such types  of  applications  as  the  commission  deems
      appropriate.  Failure to post any such notice shall not affect or impair
      the validity of any  decision  of  the  city  planning  commission,  the
      council or other agency or official pursuant to this chapter.
        m.    A  community or borough board may review an application which is
      subject to the uniform land use  review  procedure    pursuant  to  this
      section  but does not involve land so located as to require reference to
      such board for review, if in the board's judgment the application  might
      significantly  affect  the  welfare of the community district or borough
      served by such board.  In such a case the application  and  the  related
      materials submitted to the affected board or boards by the city planning
      department  shall  be  submitted  also to such board upon the request of
      such board, and such board may hold its own public hearing thereon if it
      so desires and may submit its  own  written  recommendations  in  regard
    
      thereto  to  the  city planning commission for consideration at any time
      before the city planning commission takes action thereon.
