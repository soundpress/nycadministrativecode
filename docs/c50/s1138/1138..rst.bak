Section 1138. ::    
        
     
        §  1138. Term Limits. a. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
      contained in this charter, no person shall be eligible to be elected  to
      or  serve  in the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough
      president or council member if that  person  had  previously  held  such
      office  for  two or more consecutive full terms, unless one full term or
      more has elapsed since that person last held such office.
        b. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no  local  law
      may  be  enacted  by  the  city  council,  including  but not limited to
      amendment of the provisions of this chapter, if  such  local  law  would
      alter  or  permit alteration of the term limit set forth in this section
      as such limit applies to any person then serving in the office of mayor,
      public advocate, comptroller, borough president or council member.
        c. Severability. If any provision of this section, or any provision of
      paragraph one of subdivision  k  of  section  eleven  hundred  fifty-two
      relating  to  the  application of this section, shall be held invalid or
      ineffective in whole or  in  part  or  inapplicable  to  any  person  or
      situation,  such  holding  shall  not  affect,  impair or invalidate the
      remainder of this section and such paragraph, and all  other  provisions
      thereof  shall  nevertheless  be  separately and fully effective and the
      application of any such provision to other persons or  situations  shall
      not be affected.
