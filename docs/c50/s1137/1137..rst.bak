Section 1137. ::    
        
     
        §  1137.  Public Policy. It is hereby declared to be the public policy
      of the city of New York to limit the time elected officials can serve as
      mayor, public  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president  and  council
      member  so  that  there is more opportunity for citizen participation in
      the legislative and executive branches  and  the  airing  of  a  greater
      diversity  of  ideas.  It  is  further declared that this policy is most
      appropriately served by limiting the time such officials  can  serve  to
      not  more  than  two consecutive full terms. It is further declared that
      public confidence in  government  should  be  protected  by  restricting
      amendments  that  would  affect  the  application  of term limits to any
      elected official then in office.
