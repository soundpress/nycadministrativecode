Chapter 50 - TERM LIMITS
========================

Section 1137.
-------------

Section 1137. ::    
        
     
        §  1137.  Public Policy. It is hereby declared to be the public policy
      of the city of New York to limit the time elected officials can serve as
      mayor, public  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president  and  council
      member  so  that  there is more opportunity for citizen participation in
      the legislative and executive branches  and  the  airing  of  a  greater
      diversity  of  ideas.  It  is  further declared that this policy is most
      appropriately served by limiting the time such officials  can  serve  to
      not  more  than  two consecutive full terms. It is further declared that
      public confidence in  government  should  be  protected  by  restricting
      amendments  that  would  affect  the  application  of term limits to any
      elected official then in office.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    

Section 1138.
-------------

Section 1138. ::    
        
     
        §  1138. Term Limits. a. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
      contained in this charter, no person shall be eligible to be elected  to
      or  serve  in the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough
      president or council member if that  person  had  previously  held  such
      office  for  two or more consecutive full terms, unless one full term or
      more has elapsed since that person last held such office.
        b. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, no  local  law
      may  be  enacted  by  the  city  council,  including  but not limited to
      amendment of the provisions of this chapter, if  such  local  law  would
      alter  or  permit alteration of the term limit set forth in this section
      as such limit applies to any person then serving in the office of mayor,
      public advocate, comptroller, borough president or council member.
        c. Severability. If any provision of this section, or any provision of
      paragraph one of subdivision  k  of  section  eleven  hundred  fifty-two
      relating  to  the  application of this section, shall be held invalid or
      ineffective in whole or  in  part  or  inapplicable  to  any  person  or
      situation,  such  holding  shall  not  affect,  impair or invalidate the
      remainder of this section and such paragraph, and all  other  provisions
      thereof  shall  nevertheless  be  separately and fully effective and the
      application of any such provision to other persons or  situations  shall
      not be affected.
