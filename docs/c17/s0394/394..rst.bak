        §  394.  Powers  and  duties.  a. Except as otherwise provided in this
      chapter or other law, the corporation  counsel  shall  be  attorney  and
      counsel  for the city and every agency thereof and shall have charge and
      conduct of all the law business of the city  and  its  agencies  and  in
      which the city is interested.
        b.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in this chapter or other law, the
      corporation  counsel  shall  have  charge  and  conduct  of  the   legal
      proceedings necessary in opening, widening, altering and closing streets
      and  in  acquiring  real  estate  or  interests  therein for the city by
      condemnation proceedings, and the  preparation  of  all  leases,  deeds,
      contracts, bonds, and other legal papers of the city, or of or connected
      with  any  agency  or officer thereof, and the corporation counsel shall
      approve as to form all such deeds and  bonds  and,  individually  or  by
      standard type of class, all contracts, leases and other legal papers.
        c.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in this chapter or other law, the
      corporation counsel shall have the right to institute actions in law  or
      equity and any proceedings provided by law in any court, local, state or
      national,  to  maintain,  defend  and  establish  the rights, interests,
      revenues, property, privileges, franchises or demands of the city or  of
      any part or portion thereof, or of the people thereof, or to collect any
      money, debts, fines or penalties or to enforce the laws. The corporation
      counsel  shall  not  be  empowered  to  compromise, settle or adjust any
      rights, claims, demands, or causes of action in favor of or against  the
      city,  and shall not permit, offer or confess judgment against the city,
      or accept any offer of  judgment  in  favor  of  the  city  without  the
      previous approval of the comptroller, except that with regard to matters
      involving  excise and non-property taxes, such previous written approval
      shall be obtained from the  finance  administrator;  provided,  however,
      that  this  inhibition  shall  not  operate  to  limit  or  abridge  the
      discretion of the corporation counsel in regard to the proper conduct of
      the trial of any action or proceeding or  to  deprive  such  corporation
      counsel  of the powers and privileges ordinarily exercised in the courts
      of litigation by attorneys-at-law when acting for private clients.
