The department shall only enter into an agreement pursuant to this subdivision with an awardee that has obtained a license issued by the business integrity commission pursuant to subdivision a of section 16-505 on or before the date of such agreement. A proposer that responds to the request for proposals authorized pursuant to subdivision b of this section that does not hold such a license at the time a proposal is submitted pursuant to this section must submit an application for such a license to the business integrity commission no later than the date such proposal is submitted to the department.
