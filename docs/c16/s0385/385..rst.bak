Section 385. ::    
        
     
        § 385. Heads of mayoral agencies. a. This chapter shall apply to heads
      of agencies holding office upon appointment of the mayor and to heads of
      those  units  within the executive office of the mayor designated by the
      mayor to be covered by the provisions of the chapter. It shall not apply
      to agencies headed by boards, commissions, or other multi-member  bodies
      whether  appointed  by the mayor or otherwise, nor to elected officials,
      nor to other agencies the heads of  which  are  appointed  by  officials
      other  than  the  mayor  or  by  multi-member bodies. References in this
      chapter to other sections of the  charter  shall  not  be  construed  to
      affect the applicability of those sections to officials and agencies not
      subject to this chapter.
        b.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  by law, all functions, powers and
      duties assigned to each mayoral agency by the charter or other law shall
      be vested in the head of such agency.  In  exercising  such  powers  and
      duties  and  the  powers  and duties specifically assigned to the agency
      head, such official shall  exercise  due  diligence  in  ensuring  their
      faithful  execution,  enforcement  and  performance.  In addition to the
      powers and duties granted to them and their agencies by the  charter  or
      by other law, and in addition to such other functions as are assigned to
      them  by  the mayor, heads of mayoral agencies shall have the powers and
      duties listed in the remaining sections of this chapter.
