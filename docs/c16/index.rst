Any material change in the information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported to the commission within 10 business days thereof. If the commission has reasonable cause to believe that such an officer lacks good character, honesty and integrity, it may require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the commission for such purpose and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of criminal justice services and/or the federal bureau of investigation for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records.

e. A license or registration issued pursuant to this chapter or any rule promulgated hereunder shall not be transferred or assigned to any person or used by any person other than the licensee or registrant to whom it was issued.

*§ 16-507 Registration application.* ::


a. Except in the case of a business issued a registration by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, an applicant for registration shall submit an application on a form prescribed by the commission and containing such information as the commission determines will adequately identify the business of such applicant.

   (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a trade waste broker or the issuance of a registration issued by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals of such broker or such exempt business do not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted and provide the background information required by subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, revoke the registration of such trade waste broker or such exempt business for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i) through (x) of subdivision a of section 16-509 of this chapter.

An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivisions c and d of section 16-505 may submit to the commission any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer’s good character, honesty and integrity. If the commission determines pursuant to this subdivision that there are sufficient grounds to disqualify a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, the commission shall suspend such person from holding office pending a final determination and, in the event such person is disqualified, such suspension shall continue pending resignation or vacatur of or removal from office.

Upon written request of a person suspended pursuant to subdivision g of this section within 10 business days of the commission’s determination, the director of the office of collective bargaining shall prepare a list of the names of the first fifteen arbitrators selected at random from the roster of arbitrators approved by the office of collective bargaining and present the first five names on such list to the suspended person and the commission. Within alternating periods of five business days the suspended person and then the commission shall each strike a name from the list of selected arbitrators. If the parties cannot within two additional business days jointly appoint an arbitrator from those remaining on the list, the suspended person and then the commission shall within alternating periods of two business days each strike an additional name from the list. The remaining arbitrator shall then be appointed as the arbitrator for that proceeding and shall establish a schedule for such proceeding. In the event that such arbitrator declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment, then the director of the office of collective bargaining shall within five business days present to the suspended person and the commission the next five names on the list of arbitrators previously selected at random and the procedures set forth in this subdivision for appointing an arbitrator shall be applied to this second group. In the event that the arbitrator appointed from this second group declines the appointment or for any reason is unable to accept the appointment, then the director of the office of collective bargaining shall present the remaining five names from the list of arbitrators selected at random and the suspended person shall select an arbitrator from such group. Such arbitrator shall make a final report and recommendations in writing concerning the disqualification. The commission shall accept such report and recommendations and issue its final determination consistent with such report and recommendations. In the event that the suspended person does not make a request for arbitration within the ten business-day period, he or she shall be disqualified from holding office.

i. Upon receiving a final determination from the commission pursuant to subdivision h disqualifying a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, such person shall resign or vacate such office within fourteen business days or, if such person fails to resign or vacate such office within such time period, such union or organization shall remove such person forthwith from such office. Failure of such a person to resign or vacate office within such time period shall subject such person to the penalties set forth in section 16-515. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commission to disqualify a labor union or labor organization from representing or seeking to represent employees of a business required to be licensed or registered pursuant to section 16-505.

j. In reaching a determination to fingerprint an officer of a labor union or labor organization pursuant to subdivision d of section 16-505 or to suspend or disqualify such an officer pursuant to subdivisions g and h of this section, the commission shall give substantial weight to the results of any investigation conducted by an independent investigator, monitor, trustee or other person or body charged with the investigation or oversight of such labor union or labor organization, including whether such investigation has failed to return charges against such officer.

k. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall apply to any labor union or labor organization representing or seeking to represent employees of businesses required to be licensed or registered pursuant to this chapter.








*§ 16-510 Investigation of employees.* ::


a. (i) Each person who is not otherwise a principal as defined in section 16-501 of this chapter and who is employed or proposed to be employed by a licensee in a managerial capacity, or in a job category specified in rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter, and each person who acts or is proposed to act in such a capacity or in such a category as an agent of a licensee, shall: (i) be fingerprinted by a person designated for such purpose by the commission and pay a fee to be submitted by the commission to the division of criminal justice services for the purposes of obtaining criminal history records, and (ii) submit to the commission the information set forth in subparagraphs (b) through (n) of paragraph (ii) of subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and pay the fee for the investigation of such information set forth in the rules promulgated pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter. Where, at any time subsequent to an investigation of an employee subject to the provisions of this subdivision, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that such employee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may conduct an additional investigation of such employee and may require, if necessary, that such employee provide information updating, supplementing or explaining information previously submitted. The job categories specified in rules of the commission for purposes of such fingerprinting and disclosure shall not include personnel engaged solely in operating vehicles or handling waste or clerical personnel who have no contact with customers.

   (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a licensee shall provide the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition to the business of the licensee of any person subject to the provisions of this subdivision. The commission may waive or shorten such ten day period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based on information available to it, that the addition of such new person may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such person pending the completion of an investigation by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition of such new person pending completion of the investigation would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such investigation, the commission makes a final determination that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless the employment of such person in the business of such licensee is discontinued within the time period prescribed by the commission.

b. (i) Where the commission has reasonable cause to believe that an employee or agent or prospective employee or agent of a licensee or an applicant for a license not subject to the provisions of subdivision a of this section lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission shall notify such employee or agent or prospective employee or agent that he or she shall be required to be fingerprinted and submit the information required by subdivision a of this section.

c. Where, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, the official designated by the commission to review the findings of such investigation concludes that an employee or agent or prospective employee or agent of a licensee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, such person shall be provided with notice of such conclusion and the reasons therefor and may contest the conclusion in person or in writing to such official. Such official shall review such response and, in the event that he or she continues to find that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, shall submit such final conclusion to the commission. The commission shall provide such person with notice of the conclusion of the official and an opportunity to be heard to appeal such conclusion before the commission makes a final determination.

d. A licensee shall not employ or engage as an agent any person with respect to whom the commission has made a final determination, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity.






*§ 16-511 Independent auditing or monitoring required.* ::


a. The commission may, in the event the background investigation conducted pursuant to section 16-508 of this chapter produces adverse information, require as a condition of a license that the licensee enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commission. Such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by the licensee, shall provide that the auditor investigate the activities of the licensee with respect to the licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commission shall determine by rule. The contract shall provide further that the auditor report the findings of such monitoring and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis, no less than four times a year.

b. In the case of an applicant or licensee who is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action for a crime that would provide a basis for the refusal to issue a license under this chapter, the commission, in its discretion, may, in the case of an applicant, refrain from making a licensing determination until final disposition of the criminal case, and may also require as a condition of the license that an applicant or licensee enter into a contract with an independent monitor approved or selected by the commission. The cost of such contract shall be paid by the applicant or licensee, and such contract shall require that the monitor review and either approve or disapprove certain actions proposed to be taken by the licensee, where such actions fall within a category identified by rule of the commission as having a particular bearing on the fitness of an applicant or a licensee to hold a license to conduct a trade waste removal business under this chapter. Such actions shall include, without limitation, any decision to assign contracts for the removal, collection or disposal of trade waste, any decision to transfer an ownership interest or substantial assets to another person or entity where such interests or assets exceed a threshold established in such rule, any significant expenditure by the business as defined in such rule, and the initiation of any litigation against a customer or another trade waste removal business or its customer. The monitor shall report promptly to the commission concerning the disposition of any such actions in the manner set forth in rules of the commission.

c. The commission shall be authorized to prescribe, in any contract required by the commission pursuant to this section, such reasonable terms and conditions as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the purposes hereof.






*§ 16-512 Investigations by the department of investigation.* ::


In addition to any other investigation authorized pursuant to law, the commissioner of the department of investigation shall, at the request of the commission, conduct a study or investigation of any matter arising under the provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to investigation of the information required to be submitted by applicants for licenses and employees and the ongoing conduct of licensees.

   (1) suspend a license issued pursuant to this chapter for thirty days following determination that the licensee, or any of its principals, employees or agents has violated subdivision a of section 16-524 of this chapter; and

   (2) revoke a license issued pursuant to this chapter upon determination that the licensee, or any of its principals, employees or agents has violated subdivision a of section 16-524 of this chapter two times within a period of three years.








*§ 16-514 Emergency suspension of license or registration.* ::


Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or rules promulgated thereto, the commission may, upon a determination that the operation of the business of a licensee or the removal of waste by a business required by this chapter to be registered creates an imminent danger to life or property, or upon a finding that there has likely been false or fraudulent information submitted in an application pursuant to section 16-507 or section 16-508 of this chapter, immediately suspend such license or registration without a prior hearing, provided that provision shall be made for an immediate appeal of such suspension to the chair of the commission who shall determine such appeal forthwith. In the event that the chair upholds the suspension, an opportunity for a hearing shall be provided on an expedited basis, within a period not to exceed four business days and the commission shall issue a final determination no later than four days following the conclusion of such hearing.

   6. the history of complaints from commercial establishments within the district regarding overcharging for the removal of trade waste or the inability to change providers of trade waste removal services.

b. For each area designated as a special trade waste removal district by the commission pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the commission shall be authorized to enter into agreements with one or more specified licensee(s) permitting such licensee(s) to provide for the removal of trade waste within such district. The term of any such agreement, inclusive of any period by which the original term is extended at the option of the commission, shall not exceed two years. No such agreement(s) shall be entered into until a public hearing has been held with respect thereto after publication in the City Record at least thirty days in advance of such hearing and the commission has solicited as part of the record of such hearing whether there is support for the establishment of such special trade waste removal district from local business organizations or business improvement districts.

c. The commission shall issue requests for proposals to conduct trade waste removal in a special trade waste removal district and, based upon the review and evaluation of responses thereto, may negotiate and enter into such agreement(s) pursuant to subdivision b of this section, as the commission, in its discretion, determines will best provide for the efficient and orderly removal of trade waste in such district. Such request for proposals shall solicit information regarding the qualifications of proposers, the nature and frequency of the trade waste removal services to be provided, the rate or rates to be charged to establishments for such services, the nature and extent of recycling services and waste audit services, if any, to be provided, and any other information relating to performance standards, customer service and security of performance the commission deems appropriate.

   (6) require that the licensee shall enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commission, and that such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by the licensee, shall provide: that the auditor shall investigate the activities of the licensee with respect to the licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commission shall determine by rule; and that the auditor shall report the findings of such monitoring and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis, no less than four times a year. The commission shall be authorized to prescribe such reasonable terms and conditions in such contract as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

No service provided pursuant to an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall be subcontracted, nor shall the right to provide service pursuant to such an agreement be assigned or otherwise delegated, whether upon an emergency or any other basis, unless the commission has provided specific written authorization therefor.

f. The commission shall be authorized, upon due notice and hearing, to terminate an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section based upon a determination that there has been a default in the performance of the terms and conditions of such agreement. In the event of termination, if the remaining licensees authorized to remove trade waste in the special trade waste district lack the capacity to adequately service the commercial establishments in such districts the commission may, as appropriate:

   (i) enter into an additional agreement with a licensee who responded to the request for proposals previously issued for the special trade waste removal district pursuant to subdivision c of this section; or

   (ii) issue a new request for proposals pursuant to subdivision c of such section.

g. The provisions of this section and agreements concluded pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall not apply to:

a. Definitions. For the purposes of this section:

   Side guard.

Except where otherwise authorized by rule of the commission, side guards: shall allow for a maximum 13.8 inch ground clearance, maximum 13.8 inch top clearance up to four feet in height, and a minimum 440 pound impact strength; must achieve a smooth and continuous longitudinal (forward to backward) impact surface flush with the vehicle sidewall; may include rail style guards, provided such rails be no less than four inches tall and no more than 11.8 inches apart; and may incorporate other vehicle features such as tool boxes and ladders.

   Trade waste hauling vehicle. The term "trade waste hauling vehicle" means any motor vehicle with a manufacturer's gross vehicle weight rating exceeding 10,000 pounds that is owned or operated by an entity that is required to be licensed or registered by the commission pursuant to section 16-505 of the code and that is operated in New York city for the collection, removal, transportation or disposal of trade waste.

b. Side guards. No later than January 1, 2024, all trade waste hauling vehicles shall be equipped with side guards.

c. Enforcement.

   1. Any owner or operator of a trade waste hauling vehicle that violates any provision of this section shall be liable for a civil penalty of ten thousand dollars per vehicle that is in violation, returnable to the office of administrative trials and hearings. Each notice of violation shall contain an order of the chair of the commission directing the respondent to correct the condition constituting the violation and to file with the commission electronically, or in such other manner as the commission shall authorize, a certification that the condition has been corrected within thirty days from the date of the order. In addition to such civil penalty, a separate additional penalty may be imposed of not more than five hundred dollars for each day that the violation is not corrected beyond thirty days from such order.

   2. For the purposes of this section, if the office of administrative trials and hearings finds that a certification of correction filed pursuant to this subdivision contained material false statements relating to the correction of a violation, such certification of correction shall be null and void, in addition to or as an alternative to any other penalties provided by law. It shall be an affirmative defense that the respondent neither knew nor should have known that such statements were false.

   3. The commission shall have the authority to promulgate rules requiring the installation of side guards that are to be fit to the side of any trade waste hauling vehicle, and may establish rules establishing side guard specifications that depart from the default specifications outlined in subdivision a of this section when such departure is deemed necessary by the commission. The commission may further promulgate any rules necessary to enforce the provisions of this section, including but not limited to establishing procedures for owners and operators of trade waste hauling vehicles to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section.
