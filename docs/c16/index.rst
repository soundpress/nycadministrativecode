Except in the case of a business issued a registration by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, an applicant for registration shall submit an application on a form prescribed by the commission and containing such information as the commission determines will adequately identify the business of such applicant.

c. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commission may, when there is reasonable cause to believe that a trade waste broker who is an applicant for registration lacks good character, honesty and integrity, require that such applicant be fingerprinted and provide to the commission the information set forth in subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to register such applicant for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i) through (xi) of subdivision a of section 16-509 of this chapter.

   (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a trade waste broker or the issuance of a registration issued by reason of the grant of an exemption from the requirement for a license pursuant to section 16-505 of this chapter, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals of such broker or such exempt business do not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may require that such principal(s) be fingerprinted and provide the background information required by subdivision b of section 16-508 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, revoke the registration of such trade waste broker or such exempt business for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i) through (x) of subdivision a of section 16-509 of this chapter.

The commission may require that such applicants pay such fees to cover the expenses of fingerprinting and background investigations provided for in this subdivision as are set forth in the rules promulgated pursuant to section 16-504 of this chapter.

a. The commission may, by majority vote of its entire membership and after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to issue a license to an applicant who lacks good character, honesty and integrity.

   (i) failure by such applicant to provide truthful information in connection with the application;

   (ii) a pending indictment or criminal action against such applicant for a crime which under this subdivision would provide a basis for the refusal of such license, or a pending civil or administrative action to which such applicant is a party and which directly relates to the fitness to conduct the business or perform the work for which the license is sought, in which cases the commission may defer consideration of an application until a decision has been reached by the court or administrative tribunal before which such action is pending;

   (iii) conviction of such applicant for a crime which, considering the factors set forth in section seven hundred fifty-three of the correction law, would provide a basis under such law for the refusal of such license;

   (v) commission of a racketeering activity or knowing association with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, or the equivalent offense under the laws of any other jurisdiction;

   (vi) association with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the applicant knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person;

For purposes of determination of the character, honesty and integrity of a trade waste broker pursuant to subdivision c or subdivision d of section 16-507 of this chapter, the term "applicant" shall refer to the business of such trade waste broker and all the principals thereof; for purposes of determining the good character, honesty and integrity of employees or agents pursuant to section 16-510 of this chapter, the term "applicant" as used herein shall be deemed to apply to employees, agents or prospective employees or agents of an applicant for a license or a licensee.

b. The commission may refuse to issue a license or registration to an applicant for such license or an applicant for registration who has knowingly failed to provide the information and/or documentation required by the commission pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant hereto or who has otherwise failed to demonstrate eligibility for such license under this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant hereto.

c. The commission may refuse to issue a license to an applicant when such applicant: (i) was previously issued a license or a trade waste permit pursuant to this chapter or former subchapter eighteen of chapter two of title twenty of this code and such license was revoked pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or revoked or not renewed pursuant to the provisions of such former subchapter eighteen or any rules promulgated thereto; or (ii) has been determined to have committed any of the acts which would be a basis for the suspension or revocation of a license pursuant to this chapter or any rules promulgated hereto.

f. On or after January 1, 2024, the commission may refuse to issue a license or registration to an applicant that has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that such applicant will at all times meet the requirements of section 16-526 of the code, or any rule promulgated pursuant thereto, in the performance of such license or registration.

Where, at any time subsequent to an investigation of an employee subject to the provisions of this subdivision, the commission has reasonable cause to believe that such employee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission may conduct an additional investigation of such employee and may require, if necessary, that such employee provide information updating, supplementing or explaining information previously submitted. The job categories specified in rules of the commission for purposes of such fingerprinting and disclosure shall not include personnel engaged solely in operating vehicles or handling waste or clerical personnel who have no contact with customers.

   (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a licensee shall provide the commission with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition to the business of the licensee of any person subject to the provisions of this subdivision. The commission may waive or shorten such ten day period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commission determines within such period, based on information available to it, that the addition of such new person may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such person pending the completion of an investigation by the commission. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commission that the addition of such new person pending completion of the investigation would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such investigation, the commission makes a final determination that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless the employment of such person in the business of such licensee is discontinued within the time period prescribed by the commission.

b. (i) Where the commission has reasonable cause to believe that an employee or agent or prospective employee or agent of a licensee or an applicant for a license not subject to the provisions of subdivision a of this section lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commission shall notify such employee or agent or prospective employee or agent that he or she shall be required to be fingerprinted and submit the information required by subdivision a of this section.

c. Where, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, the official designated by the commission to review the findings of such investigation concludes that an employee or agent or prospective employee or agent of a licensee lacks good character, honesty and integrity, such person shall be provided with notice of such conclusion and the reasons therefor and may contest the conclusion in person or in writing to such official. Such official shall review such response and, in the event that he or she continues to find that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity, shall submit such final conclusion to the commission. The commission shall provide such person with notice of the conclusion of the official and an opportunity to be heard to appeal such conclusion before the commission makes a final determination.

d. A licensee shall not employ or engage as an agent any person with respect to whom the commission has made a final determination, following a background investigation conducted pursuant to this section, that such person lacks good character, honesty and integrity.






*§ 16-511 Independent auditing or monitoring required.* ::


a. The commission may, in the event the background investigation conducted pursuant to section 16-508 of this chapter produces adverse information, require as a condition of a license that the licensee enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commission. Such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by the licensee, shall provide that the auditor investigate the activities of the licensee with respect to the licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commission shall determine by rule. The contract shall provide further that the auditor report the findings of such monitoring and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis, no less than four times a year.

b. In the case of an applicant or licensee who is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action for a crime that would provide a basis for the refusal to issue a license under this chapter, the commission, in its discretion, may, in the case of an applicant, refrain from making a licensing determination until final disposition of the criminal case, and may also require as a condition of the license that an applicant or licensee enter into a contract with an independent monitor approved or selected by the commission. The cost of such contract shall be paid by the applicant or licensee, and such contract shall require that the monitor review and either approve or disapprove certain actions proposed to be taken by the licensee, where such actions fall within a category identified by rule of the commission as having a particular bearing on the fitness of an applicant or a licensee to hold a license to conduct a trade waste removal business under this chapter. Such actions shall include, without limitation, any decision to assign contracts for the removal, collection or disposal of trade waste, any decision to transfer an ownership interest or substantial assets to another person or entity where such interests or assets exceed a threshold established in such rule, any significant expenditure by the business as defined in such rule, and the initiation of any litigation against a customer or another trade waste removal business or its customer. The monitor shall report promptly to the commission concerning the disposition of any such actions in the manner set forth in rules of the commission.

a. In addition to the penalties provided in section 16-515 of this chapter, the commission may, after due notice and opportunity to be heard, revoke or suspend a license or registration issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter when the registrant or licensee and/or its principals, employees and/or agents:

For each area designated as a special trade waste removal district by the commission pursuant to subdivision a of this section, the commission shall be authorized to enter into agreements with one or more specified licensee(s) permitting such licensee(s) to provide for the removal of trade waste within such district. The term of any such agreement, inclusive of any period by which the original term is extended at the option of the commission, shall not exceed two years. No such agreement(s) shall be entered into until a public hearing has been held with respect thereto after publication in the City Record at least thirty days in advance of such hearing and the commission has solicited as part of the record of such hearing whether there is support for the establishment of such special trade waste removal district from local business organizations or business improvement districts.

c. The commission shall issue requests for proposals to conduct trade waste removal in a special trade waste removal district and, based upon the review and evaluation of responses thereto, may negotiate and enter into such agreement(s) pursuant to subdivision b of this section, as the commission, in its discretion, determines will best provide for the efficient and orderly removal of trade waste in such district. Such request for proposals shall solicit information regarding the qualifications of proposers, the nature and frequency of the trade waste removal services to be provided, the rate or rates to be charged to establishments for such services, the nature and extent of recycling services and waste audit services, if any, to be provided, and any other information relating to performance standards, customer service and security of performance the commission deems appropriate.

   (6) require that the licensee shall enter into a contract with an independent auditor approved or selected by the commission, and that such contract, the cost of which shall be paid by the licensee, shall provide: that the auditor shall investigate the activities of the licensee with respect to the licensee's compliance with the provisions of this chapter, other applicable federal, state and local laws and such other matters as the commission shall determine by rule; and that the auditor shall report the findings of such monitoring and investigation to the commission on a periodic basis, no less than four times a year. The commission shall be authorized to prescribe such reasonable terms and conditions in such contract as the commission deems necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

f. The commission shall be authorized, upon due notice and hearing, to terminate an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of this section based upon a determination that there has been a default in the performance of the terms and conditions of such agreement. In the event of termination, if the remaining licensees authorized to remove trade waste in the special trade waste district lack the capacity to adequately service the commercial establishments in such districts the commission may, as appropriate:

   (i) enter into an additional agreement with a licensee who responded to the request for proposals previously issued for the special trade waste removal district pursuant to subdivision c of this section; or

   (ii) issue a new request for proposals pursuant to subdivision c of such section.

g. The provisions of this section and agreements concluded pursuant to subdivision b of this section shall not apply to:

   (1) the collection and disposal of recyclable materials as such term is defined in subdivision i of section 16-303 of this code where a commercial establishment wishes to contract separately for the sale of any such materials;

   (8) the removal and disposal of trade waste from a building located within the special trade waste removal district owned or controlled by an individual or an entity that owns or controls a building or buildings within the city of New York which, in the aggregate, occupy a floor area of one million square feet or more, where the contract for the collection, removal or disposal of trade waste for the building located within the special trade waste removal district is with a licensee who also provides trade waste removal services for other buildings within the city of New York that are owned or controlled by such individual or entity.

h. Except for a licensee who has entered into an agreement with the commission pursuant to subdivision b of this section, a trade waste business required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter shall notify the commission of any agreement to provide a service described in subdivision g of this section within a special trade waste district. The commission may provide by rule for the visual identification of vehicles providing such services in a special trade waste district.

b. Whenever a person interferes or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation, or coercion, or by destruction or damage of property or equipment, with performance of the terms of an agreement entered into pursuant to subdivision b of section 16-523 of this code, the corporation counsel, at the request of the commission, may bring a civil action on behalf of the city for injunctive and other appropriate relief in order to permit the uninterrupted and unimpeded delivery of such services.

A copy of such list shall be made available upon request to an applicant for a license pursuant to this chapter.

In addition to such civil penalty, a separate additional penalty may be imposed of not more than five hundred dollars for each day that the violation is not corrected beyond thirty days from such order.

   2. For the purposes of this section, if the office of administrative trials and hearings finds that a certification of correction filed pursuant to this subdivision contained material false statements relating to the correction of a violation, such certification of correction shall be null and void, in addition to or as an alternative to any other penalties provided by law. It shall be an affirmative defense that the respondent neither knew nor should have known that such statements were false.

   3. The commission shall have the authority to promulgate rules requiring the installation of side guards that are to be fit to the side of any trade waste hauling vehicle, and may establish rules establishing side guard specifications that depart from the default specifications outlined in subdivision a of this section when such departure is deemed necessary by the commission. The commission may further promulgate any rules necessary to enforce the provisions of this section, including but not limited to establishing procedures for owners and operators of trade waste hauling vehicles to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section.
