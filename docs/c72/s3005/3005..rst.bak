      filled  by  appointment  by  whosoever was responsible for such original
      appointment. The board shall meet once every 90 days or upon the request
      of any of its members. Any member of  such  board  shall  have  complete
      access,  during  work  hours,  to  inspect  and  review  any  appraisal,
      organization, processing or archiving of city records in the custody  of
      an entity with which an agreement has been entered into for the purposes
      specified  in  subdivision  five of section 3003. Such board may request
      and receive,  from  the  department,  assistance  and  data  as  may  be

      shall render annually to the  mayor  a  report  reviewing  the  archival
