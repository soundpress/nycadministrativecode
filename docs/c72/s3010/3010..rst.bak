        §  3010.  Municipal  archives reference and research fund. 1. There is
      hereby established a municipal archives  reference  and  research  fund,
      which  shall  be credited with all sums appropriated therefor, donations
      made thereto, and proceeds from the  disposition  of  personal  property
      which is in the custody of the department and which the commissioner has
      determined is not a record which must be retained pursuant to law and is
      not  necessary  for  archival, reference, or research purposes. Interest
      accruing on principal from all  aforementioned  sources  also  shall  be
      credited to the fund.
        2.  The  municipal archives reference and research fund established by
      this section shall be used, subject to the approval of the  director  of
      management  and  budget,  by  the department for purposes related to its
      library and archival research programs including, but  not  limited  to,
      purchasing  and  conserving  books  and other records, financing lecture
      series and commissioning studies and articles.
