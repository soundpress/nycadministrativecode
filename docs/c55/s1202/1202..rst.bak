      and tunnels,  parks  and  recreational  facilities,  sewers  and  sewage
      disposal   plants,  water  supply  and  distribution  structures,  waste

      perform responsibilities as the mayor shall direct with respect  to  the
      acquisition of real or personal property in connection with construction
      or  a capital project, including responsibilities delegated elsewhere by
      the charter or the administrative code, provided that the acquisition of
      real property shall be made in the  same  manner  as  acquisitions  made
      pursuant  to  subdivision  three  of section sixteen hundred two of this
      charter.
        b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision  of  this  section,  the
      mayor may assign in whole or in part operations and functions related to
      a  particular  construction  project  or particular category or class of
      construction projects to an agency other than the department  of  design
      and  construction,  if  the  mayor determines that it is appropriate for
      such other agency to perform such operations and functions.
