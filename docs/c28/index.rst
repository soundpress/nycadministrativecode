Chapter 3: Landmarks Preservation Preservation and Historic Districts

*§ 25-301 Purpose and declaration of public policy.* ::


a. The council finds that many improvements, as herein defined, and landscape features, as herein defined, having a special character or a special historical or aesthetic interest or value and many improvements representing the finest architectural products of distinct periods in the history of the city, have been uprooted, notwithstanding the feasibility of preserving and continuing the use of such improvements and landscape features, and without adequate consideration of the irreplaceable loss to the people of the city of the aesthetic, cultural and historic values represented by such improvements and landscape features. In addition, distinct areas may be similarly uprooted or may have their distinctiveness destroyed, although the preservation thereof may be both feasible and desirable. It is the sense of the council that the standing of this city as a world wide tourist center and world capital of business, culture and government cannot be maintained or enhanced by disregarding the historical and architectural heritage of the city and by countenancing the destruction of such cultural assets.

b. It is hereby declared as a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of improvements and landscape features of special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of the health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people. The purpose of this chapter is to (a) effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation of such improvements and landscape features and of districts which represent or reflect elements of the city's cultural, social, economic, political and architectural history; (b) safeguard the city's historic, aesthetic and cultural heritage, as embodied and reflected in such improvements, landscape features and districts; (c) stabilize and improve property values in such districts; (d) foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the past; (e) protect and enhance the city's attractions to tourists and visitors and the support and stimulus to business and industry thereby provided; (f) strengthen the economy of the city; and (g) promote the use of historic districts, landmarks, interior landmarks and scenic landmarks for the education, pleasure and welfare of the people of the city.

*§ 25-306 Determination of request for certificate of no effect on protected architectural features.* ::


a. (1) In any case where an applicant for a permit from the department of buildings to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site or in an historic district or containing an interior landmark, or an applicant for a special permit from the city planning commission or the board of standards and appeals authorizing any such work pursuant to article seven of the zoning resolution, or amendments thereof, files a copy of such application or amended application with the commission, together with a request for a certificate of no effect on protected architectural features, the commission shall determine:

      (a) whether the proposed work would change, destroy or affect any exterior architectural feature of the improvement on a landmark site or in an historic district or any interior architectural feature of the interior landmark upon which said work is to be done; and

      (b) in the case of construction of a new improvement, whether such construction would affect or not be in harmony with the external appearance of other, neighboring improvements on such site or in such district. If the commission determines such question in the negative, it shall grant such certificate; otherwise, it shall deny such request.

   (2) Within thirty days after the filing of such application and request, the commission shall either grant such certificate, or give notice to the applicant of a proposed denial of such request.

*§ 25-307 Factors governing issuance of certificate of appropriateness.* ::


a. In any case where an applicant for a permit to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, or in an historic district or containing an interior landmark, files such application with the commission together with a request for a certificate of appropriateness, and in any case where a certificate of no effect on protected architectural features is denied and the applicant thereafter, pursuant to the provisions of section 25-306 of this chapter, files a request for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall determine whether the proposed work would be appropriate for and consistent with the effectuation of the purposes of this chapter. If the commission's determination is in the affirmative on such question, it shall grant a certificate of appropriateness, and if the commission's determination is in the negative, it shall deny the applicant's request, except as otherwise provided in section 25-309 of this chapter.

b. (1) In making such determination with respect to any such application for a permit to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish an improvement in an historic district, the commission shall consider (a) the effect of the proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or affecting the exterior architectural features of the improvement upon which such work is to be done, and (b) the relationship between the results of such work and the exterior architectural features of other, neighboring improvements in such district.

   (2) In appraising such effects and relationship, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent matters, the factors of aesthetic, historical and architectural values and significance, architectural style, design, arrangement, texture, material and color.

   (3) All determinations of the commission pursuant to this subdivision b shall be made subject to the provisions of section 25-304 of this chapter, and the commission, in making any such determination, shall not apply any regulation, limitation, deter- mination or restriction as to the height and bulk of buildings, the area of yards, courts or other open spaces, density of population, the location of trades and industries, or location of buildings designed for specific uses, other than the regulations, limitations, determinations and restrictions as to such matters prescribed or made by or pursuant to applicable provisions of law, exclusive of this chapter; provided, however, that nothing contained in such section 25-304 or in this subdivision b shall be construed as limiting the power of the commission to deny a request for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or alteration of an improvement in an historic district (whether or not such request also seeks approval, in such certificate, of construction or reconstruction of any improvement), on the ground that such demolition or alteration would be inappropriate for and inconsistent with the effectuation of the purposes of this chapter, with due consideration for the factors hereinabove set forth in this subdivision b.

c. In making the determination referred to in subdivision a of this section with respect to any application for a permit to construct, reconstruct, alter or demolish any improvement on a landmark site, other than a landmark, the commission shall consider (1) the effects of the proposed work in creating, changing, destroying or affecting the exterior architectural features of the improvement upon which such work is to be done, (2) the relationship between such exterior architectural features, together with such effects, and the exterior architectural features of the landmark, and (3) the effects of the results of such work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the landmark on such site. In appraising such effects and relationship, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent matters, the factors mentioned in paragraph two of subdivision b of this section.

d. In making the determination referred to in subdivision a of this section with respect to an application for a permit to alter, reconstruct or demolish a landmark, the commission shall consider the effects of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the exterior architectural features of such landmark which cause it to possess a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value.

e. In making the determination referred to in subdivision a of this section with respect to an application for a permit to alter, reconstruct or demolish an improvement containing an interior landmark, the commission shall consider the effects of the proposed work upon the protection, enhancement, perpetuation and use of the interior architectural features of such interior landmark which cause it to possess a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value.

*§ 25-317.1 Civil penalties.* ::


a. Any person who violates any provision of sections 25-305, 25-310 or 25-311 or subdivision c of section 25-317 of this chapter or any order issued by the chair with respect to such provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty which may be recovered by the corporation counsel in a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil penalty shall be determined as follows:

   (1) The defendant shall be liable for a civil penalty of up to the fair market value of the improvement parcel, with or without the improvement, whichever is greater, where in violation of such provision or order:

      (a) all or substantially all of an improvement on a landmark site or within a historic district has been demolished;

      (b) work has been performed or a condition created or maintained which significantly impairs the structural integrity of an improvement on a landmark site or within a historic district;

      (c) work has been performed or a condition created or maintained which results in the destruction, removal or significant alteration of more than fifty percent of the square footage of two facades of an improvement on a landmark site or within a historic district, including party and sidewalls; or

      (d) the defendant has failed to take action to prevent any condition described in subparagraph a, b or c of this paragraph from occurring.

   (2) Where, in violation of such provision or order, work is performed or a condition is created or maintained which results in the destruction, removal or significant alteration of a significant portion of the protected features identified in the designation report of an interior landmark, the defendant shall be liable for a civil penalty equal to two times the estimated cost of replicating the protected features that were demolished, removed or altered.

   (3) All other violations. The defendant shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars.

   (4) For the purposes of this subdivision, each day during which there exists any violation of the provisions of paragraph three of subdivision a of section 25-305 of this chapter or paragraph two of subdivision a of section 25-310 of this chapter or subdivision a, b or c of section 25-311 of this chapter or any order issued by the chair with respect to such provisions shall constitute a separate violation.

b. In addition to or as an alternative to any of the remedies and penalties provided in this chapter, any person who violates any provision of sections 25-305, 25-310 or 25-311 or subdivision c of section 25-317 of this chapter or any order issued by the chair with respect to such provisions shall be liable for a civil penalty which may be recovered in an administrative proceeding before the office of administrative trials and hearings, the environmental control board or other administrative tribunal having jurisdiction as hereinafter provided.

   (1) An administrative proceeding for civil penalties shall be commenced by the service of a notice of violation in accordance with the applicable law and rules governing the procedures of the administrative tribunal before which the notice of violation is returnable or as otherwise provided by the rules of the commission. The notice of violation shall identify the allegedly illegal conditions or work with reasonable specificity. As used in this subdivision, the term "reasonable specificity" shall mean a description of work or conditions, reasonably described given the circumstances, sufficient to inform a reasonable person that (1) work has been or is being done without an appropriate approval from the commission, (2) conditions have been created or are being maintained in violation of this chapter, or (3) there has been a failure to take action to prevent conditions that are in violation of this chapter. Such administrative tribunal shall have the power to impose civil penalties in accordance with this chapter. A judgment of an administrative tribunal imposing civil penalties may be enforced by the commencement of a civil action or proceeding in a court or as otherwise authorized by the applicable law governing the procedures of such administrative tribunal. Prior to serving a notice of violation, the chair shall serve a warning letter upon a respondent either personally or by mail in the manner provided by the rules of the commission. The warning letter shall inform the respondent that the chair believes the respondent has violated the provisions of this chapter, shall describe generally the allegedly illegal conditions and/or activities, shall warn the respondent that the law authorizes civil penalties for such violations, and shall provide the respondent with a grace period for removing or applying for a permit to legalize or otherwise address the allegedly illegal conditions. No such warning letter shall be required prior to the service of a notice of violation where (i) the subject violation is a second or subsequent offense, (ii) the subject violation is alleged to be an intentional violation, or (iii) the chair is seeking civil penalties for failure to comply with a stop work order, issued pursuant to this chapter.

   (2) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, where a respondent has been found liable for or admitted liability to a violation of this chapter in an administrative proceeding, a civil penalty for such violation shall be imposed in accordance with the schedule set forth below.

      (a) Type A and Type B violations.

         (i) First offense. The respondent shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars.

         (ii) Second and subsequent offenses. The respondent shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars a day for each day that a condition underlying a prior violation continues to exist, measured from the date the respondent was found liable for or admitted liability to the prior violation, but in no event shall the civil penalty be less than the maximum possible penalty for a first offense.

      (b) Type C violation.

         (i) First offense. The respondent shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars.

         (ii) Second and subsequent offenses. The respondent shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than fifty dollars a day for each day that a condition underlying a prior violation continues to exist, measured from the date the respondent was found liable for or pled guilty to the prior violation, but in no event shall the civil penalty be less than the maximum possible penalty for a first offense.

   (3) Notwithstanding the penalty schedule set forth above, the chair may, in his or her discretion, for good cause shown, recommend that a lesser or no civil penalty be imposed on a respondent in an administrative proceeding.

   (4) Restrictions on service of notice of violation for second or subsequent offense.

      (a) The chair shall not serve a notice of violation for a second or subsequent offense unless (i) more than twenty-five days have elapsed since the respondent was found liable or admitted liability in the prior proceeding and (ii) where the respondent in the prior proceeding has submitted an application to the commission for an appropriate approval to legalize or to undertake the work necessary to cure the condition underlying the prior proceeding, more than thirty days have elapsed since such application has been disapproved or denied in whole or in part or if granted, such approval by its terms has expired. If the respondent has filed more than one such application with the commission, the thirty day period shall commence after the first such application has been disapproved or denied in whole or in part or, if granted, by its terms has expired.

      (b) Nothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the chair, subject to the rules of the administrative tribunal having jurisdiction over the proceeding, from serving an amended notice of violation for the purpose of clarifying the allegedly illegal conditions referred to in the prior notice of violation, or from serving a subsequent notice of violation that alleges separate violations of this chapter. An amended notice of violation shall be returnable on the same date and before the same administrative body as the initial notice of violation.

   (5) Multiple violations incurred for the same work. If work, reasonably identified in a notice of violation, was done without an appropriate approval from the commission, the total amount of any civil penalty for such work shall be determined by, to the extent feasible, separately considering and assessing a penalty for each type of work and/or each distinct effect on the protected features of the landmark, interior landmark or improvement in an historic district. In no event shall the civil penalty exceed five thousand dollars for a first offense. Where the respondent is the owner, separate penalties shall not be assessed for each type of work and/or each distinct effect if the illegal work was performed during a period of time when the premises were leased to and under the control of a person other than the owner.

   (6) Grace period.

      (a) No civil penalty shall be imposed in an administrative proceeding for a first violation if prior to the return date of the notice of violation, the respondent concedes liability for the violation and supplies the commission with proof, satisfactory to the commission, that the violation has been corrected. If the respondent makes any misrepresentation or omission of a material fact to the commission regarding the removal of the violation, the respondent shall be liable for a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars.

      (b) No civil penalty shall be imposed in an administrative proceeding for a first violation if prior to the return date of the notice of violation the respondent concedes liability for the violation and submits an application to the commission for approval to legalize or to undertake the work necessary to cure the violation.

      (c) The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to a second or subsequent offense or where the respondent is alleged to have violated a stop work order or where the respondent has after the issuance of a warning letter pursuant to paragraph one of subdivision (b) of section 25-317.1 applied for and received a permit to cure or otherwise address a violation, and the respondent has failed to cure the violation pursuant to the terms of such permit.

The order shall also identify the subject premises by the tax block and lot or street address, and shall be addressed to a person in charge of the improvement, or to a person who is alleged to have created the illegal conditions or performed, authorized overseen or permitted the illegal work. The chair may issue a separate order to each person who, as a result of the same condition or work, is alleged to have violated the provisions of this chapter.

c. In addition to any of the remedies or penalties provided for in this section, failure to comply with a stop work order shall be subject to the payment of a civil penalty in the sum of five hundred dollars for each day there is non-compliance, to be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the chair or in an administrative proceeding before the office of administrative trials and hearings, the environmental control board or other administrative tribunal having jurisdiction.

d. Enforcement proceedings.

   (1) Upon the violation of any provision of this chapter, or the failure to comply with any stop-work order issued by the chair thereunder, or whenever any person is about to engage in or is engaging in any act or practice that may constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter, the chair may request the corporation counsel to institute all necessary actions and/or proceedings to restrain, correct or abate such violation or potential violation, to compel compliance with such order and/or to seek civil penalties pursuant to this chapter. The corporation counsel may institute such actions or proceedings as may be necessary and appropriate for such purposes.

   (2) Such actions and proceedings may be instituted by the corporation counsel in the name of the city in any court of appropriate jurisdiction. In such actions or proceedings, the city may apply for restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or other provisional remedies, with or without notice.

e. Notice of violation; presumptive evidence. In any action or proceeding founded upon a claim by the chair that any law or rule enforceable by the commission has been violated, or that a lawful order issued by the chair has not been complied with, a notice of violation shall be presumptive evidence of any matter stated therein.

f. In addition to police officers, officers and employees of the commission and employees of other city agencies designated by the chair may enforce the provisions of this chapter and may issue summonses and appearance tickets returnable in the criminal court and notices of violation returnable before the environmental control board, the office of administrative trials and hearings or other administrative tribunal having jurisdiction.

Such a further hearing shall also be required in the event that the city council proposes to amend the district plan to reduce improvements or services or provide additional improvements or services not included in the original plan prior to the establishment of the district.
