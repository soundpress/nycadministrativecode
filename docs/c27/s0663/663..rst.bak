        §  663.  Meetings.  Meetings of the board shall be held at the call of

      or in his or her absence the vice-chair may administer oaths and  compel
      the attendance of witnesses. All hearings before the board shall be open
      to  the  public and shall be before at least three members of the board,
      and a concurring vote of at least three members shall be necessary to  a
      decision  to  grant  an  application or an appeal, to revoke or modify a
      variance, special permit or other decision of the  board,  or  to  make,
      amend  or  repeal  a rule or regulation. The board shall keep minutes of
      its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon every question, or
      if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall also  keep
      records  of its examinations and other official action. Such minutes and
      such records shall be public records.
