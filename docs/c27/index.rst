      following procedure:
        1. Each proposal or application shall  be  filed  with  the  board  of
      standards  and  appeals,  which shall forward a copy within five days to
      the community board for  each  community  district  in  which  the  land

      districts in a borough.
        2.  Each  such  community board shall, not later than sixty days after
      the receipt of the proposal or application, either notify the public  of
      the  proposal  or  application,  in  the  manner  specified  by the city
      planning commission pursuant to subdivision i  of  section  one  hundred
      ninety-seven-c,  conduct a public hearing thereon and prepare and submit
      a written recommendation thereon directly to the board of standards  and
      appeals, or waive the conduct of such public hearing and the preparation
      of such written recommendation.
        3.  A copy of a recommendation or waiver by a community board pursuant
      to paragraph two of this subdivision that involves land  located  within
      two  or  more  community districts in a borough shall also be filed with
      the borough  board  within  the  same  time  period  specified  in  that
      paragraph.  Not  later  than  thirty  days  after  the  filing of such a
      recommendation or waiver with the borough board by every community board
      in which the land involved is located or after  the  expiration  of  the
      time  allowed  for  such  community boards to act, the borough board may
      hold a public hearing on  the  proposal  or  application  and  any  such
      recommendation  and  may  submit  a  written  recommendation or a waiver
      thereof to the board of standards and appeals.
        4. The receipt of such a recommendation or waiver from every community
      or borough board involved, or the expiration of  the  time  allowed  for
      such  boards  to  act, shall constitute an authorization to the board of
      standards and appeals to review the application and to make a decision.
        5. If after the receipt of such a recommendation or waiver from  every
      community  or  borough  board  involved,  or  the expiration of the time
      allowed for such boards to act, the applicant for a  special  permit  or
      variance  submits  to  the board of standards and appeals any additional
      documents or plans, he or she shall at the same time forward  copies  of
      such  documents  or  plans  to the city planning commission, the council
      member involved and to the community or borough board involved.
        6. Copies of any written information submitted  by  an  applicant  for
      purposes  of  determining whether an environmental impact statement will
      be required by law in connection with an application under this section,
      and any  documents  or  records  intended  to  define  or  substantially
      redefine  the  overall scope of issues to be addressed in any such draft
      environmental impact  statement  shall  be  delivered  to  all  affected
      community boards and borough boards.
        7.  If  a meeting involving a city agency and an applicant is convened
      to define or substantially redefine the overall scope of  issues  to  be
      addressed  in  any  draft environmental impact statement required by law
      for an application subject to review under this section, each  community
      board involved and each borough president involved shall receive advance
      notice  of  such  meeting,  and  each  shall  have the right to send one
      representative to the meeting.
        b. The recommendation of a community board or borough  board  pursuant
      to  subdivision  a  of  this  section  shall  be filed with the board of
      standards and appeals and a copy sent to the city  planning  commission.
    
      The  board  of  standards and appeals shall conduct a public hearing and
      act on the proposed application.  A decision of the board shall indicate
      whether each of the specific requirements of the zoning  resolution  for
      the  granting  of  variances  has been met and shall include findings of
      fact with regard to each such requirement.
        c. Copies of a decision of the board  of  standards  and  appeals  and
      copies  of any recommendation of the affected community board or borough
      board shall be filed with the city planning commission.  Copies  of  the
      decision  shall  also  be  filed  with the affected community or borough
      boards.
        d. Any decision of the board of standards and appeals pursuant to this
      section may be reviewed as provided by law.
        e. The city planning commission shall be a party to any proceeding  to
      determine  and  vary  the  application  of  the  zoning  resolution. The
      commission may appear and be heard on any application pursuant  to  this
      section before the board of standards and appeals if, in the judgment of
      the  city  planning commission, the granting of relief requested in such
      application would violate the  requirements  of  the  zoning  resolution
      relating  to  the  granting  of  variances.  The  commission  shall have
      standing to challenge  the  granting  or  denial  of  a  variance  in  a
      proceeding  brought  pursuant  to  article  seventy-eight  of  the civil
      practice law and rules, or in any similar proceeding.
