* By the same respondent of the same provision of law, order, rule or regulation and, if the respondent is the owner, agent, lessee or other person in control of the premises with respect to which the violation occurred, at the same premises (all violations committed within two years).

Each day during which such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. The board may remit, in whole or in part, such a civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the board determination under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is no longer in violation of a provision of this code, or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board;

   (6) Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars on any owner of a device for each day such equipment is sealed pursuant to this section;

   (7) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than four thousand dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or causes or permits the breaking of, a seal placed on a device pursuant to this section.

   (8) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of twenty-five percent of that which would otherwise be imposed for each twelve decibels by which the sound or noise level measured exceeds the maximum sound level as contained in subchapters five and six of this chapter.

   (9) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of ten percent of the penalty orginally imposed, for late payment of penalty for each month, or part thereof, that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no event shall the total additional civil penalty exceed the maximum set forth in the table of civil penalties, or as modified pursuant to paragraph eight of this subdivision or paragraph ten of this subdivision, or both.

   (10) Order any person to be classified as a persistent violator if such person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on one or more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in violation of this code, where such repeated violations evidence substanial* disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent violator, the board shall in each instance double the amount of the penalty which it would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision. Such double penalties shall be imposed for violations which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding at which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for all violations committed within two years immediately following such classification, after whcih such classification shall terminate. However, if at the end of such two year period such person is still in violation of this code because of a failure to take or complete a corrective action as required by the board, such classification shall continue until such time as such person is no longer in violation of this code because of such failure, at which time such classification shall cease. Thereafter, the board may again classify such person as a persistent violator, on the same basis it used originally.

(c) The board may, upon notice pursuant to section 24-259 of this code:

   (1) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of any listed device without a certificate as required by section 24-245 of this code and the board may also seal such device;

   (2) order any person to cease and desist from tunneling without a tunneling permit as required by section 24-245 of this code and the board may also seal any device used in such tunneling;

   (3) order any person not in possession of an after hours work authorization issued pursuant to section 24-223 of this code to cease and desist from construction activities other than during the permissible hours specified in section 24-222 of this code and the board may also seal any device used in such construction activities;

   (4) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of a device without registration required by section 24-208 of this code and the board may also seal such device.

(d) The board may order the commissioner to install any apparatus or to repair or alter any device or apparatus which causes or is maintained or operated so as to cause a violation of an order issued pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section, where such repairing or alteration can reasonably be expected to correct such a violation. Any work required under such an order may be executed by the commissioner through the officers, agents or contractors of the department. The department shall be reimbursed promptly for all costs and expenses of such work by the owner of the device to which the order relates and in respect to which such expenses were incurred. Such expenses may be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner.

(e) If an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section provides for a period of time during which a person subject to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board may require the respondent to post a performance bond or other security with the department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the correction of such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a failure to meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the bond or other security shall be forfeited and shall be paid to the commissioner.

(f) (1) The board may order any person to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes causes unreasonable noise which creates imminent peril to the public health and well being, or to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes constitutes a willful or continued violation of any provision of this code or order or regulation, promulgated by the commissioner or board. Such order shall be effective upon service thereof. Any party affected by such an order may request a hearing on written notice, and he or she shall be afforded a hearing, within twenty-four hours after service of such request, pursuant to section 24-263 of this code. If such an accelerated hearing is not requested, then a hearing shall be afforded within ten days of the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its final decision and order thereon within three days from the conclusion of a hearing held pursuant to this subdivision.

(g) The default penalty imposed pursuant to paragraph 5 of subdivision (b) of this section for a violation of section 24-218(a), as set forth in section 3-115 of title 48 of the rules of the city of New York or any successor provision, shall not exceed 150 percent of the scheduled penalty set forth therein.

(c) No person shall cause or permit a building or its appurtenances or a road to be constructed, altered or repaired without taking such precautions as may be ordered by the commissioner or as established by the rules of the department to prevent dust from becoming air-borne.

(d) No person shall cause or permit any use, as defined by section 12-10 of the zoning resolution of the city of New York, to be implemented or maintained without taking reasonable precautions as established by the rules of the department, including, but not limited to, planting or covering, to prevent dust from becoming air-borne.

(e) No person shall cause or permit the spraying of any insulating material, not otherwise prohibited by this code, in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair, unless he or she complies with the rules of the department regarding precautions for the spraying of insulating material.

(f) No person shall cause or permit a building or other structure to be demolished, unless he or she complies with the following precautions:

   (1) Demolition by toppling of walls shall not occur except when approved by the commissioner pursuant to section 24-109 of this code, or when conducted by or on behalf of a city agency pursuant to chapter one of title seventeen of the code or pursuant to an order issued by the department of buildings under article two hundred fifteen of chapter two of title twenty-eight of the code.

   (2) Before the demolition of any section of wall, floor, roof, or other structure, necessary wetting procedures to lay the dust or other precautions to prevent dust from becoming air-borne, as set forth in this section and the rules of the department, shall be employed. All debris shall be thoroughly wetted before loading and while dumping into trucks, other vehicles or containers. In all cases and at all stages of demolition, wetting procedures shall be adequate to lay the dust. Trucks shall be adequately covered or enclosed to prevent dust dispersion while in transit to point of disposal.

   (3) No structural members shall be dropped or thrown from any floor but shall be carefully lowered to ground level.

   (4) Debris shall not be dropped or thrown outside the exterior walls of the building from any floor to any floor below. In buildings twelve stories or greater in height any debris transported outside the exterior walls of the building shall be transported from the upper floors via enclosed, dust-tight chutes or via buckets or other containers. Where chutes or shaftways are used either inside or outside the building, a water soaking spray shall be employed to saturate the debris before it reaches the point of discharge from the chute or shaftway. Where buckets or other containers are used, the debris shall be adequately wetted to preclude dust dispersion when buckets or other containers are dumped.

   (5) (i) In the event particulate matter becomes airborne for a continuous period of fifteen minutes, despite the application of the procedures set forth in this section and the rules of the department, or because freezing temperatures preclude the use of water for laying the demolition dust, the work of demolition shall cease at once until other adequate measures can be taken and procedures shall be evaluated by the commissioner before initiation thereof, provided, however, that if the demolition work is being conducted by or on behalf of a city agency pursuant to chapter one of title seventeen of the code or pursuant to an order issued by the department of buildings under article two hundred fifteen of chapter two of title twenty-eight of the code and freezing temperatures preclude the use of water, then the demolition work may continue as long as necessary to complete the demolition process.

      (ii) An abatement order may be issued by the commissioner, or his or her authorized representative, at any time when it is found that work is being performed in violation of the provisions of this section, or any rules promulgated thereunder, and such work poses a threat to human health and safety. Upon issuance of an abatement order, the activity giving rise to the violation shall immediately stop unless otherwise specified. Such order may be given orally or in writing to the owner, lessee or occupant of the property involved, or to the agent of any of them, or to the person or persons performing the work. Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), a verbal order shall be followed promptly by a written order and shall include the reason for the issuance of an abatement order. The order may require all such work to be done as may be necessary, in the opinion of the commissioner, to remove the danger therefrom.

      (iii) An abatement order issued pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may be appealed in accordance with the rules of the department, and the commissioner shall provide notice and an opportunity to be heard within fourteen days of the filing of such appeal. An abatement order shall be lifted if, upon appeal, the commissioner determines that the issuance of such order was not proper, or upon the submission of proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the requirements of such order have been satisfied. In the case of a verbal abatement order, if the commissioner determines that the condition that gave rise to the order has been immediately corrected, such order shall be lifted at once and shall not be followed by a written order.

It shall be the duty of an owner, lessee, agent, manager, operator and of any other person in charge of or who has control over any premises, plant, equipment, facility, device or operation to make frequent regular inspections so as to minimize the likelihood of leak or waste and within a reasonable time after the discovery or notification of any leak or wasteful condition to effect repairs or take other appropriate corrective action within the power of such person. The commissioner of environmental protection shall promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as the commissioner may from time to time deem appropriate for the prevention of the waste of water.

b. In addition to enforcement pursuant to section 24-346 the commissioner may serve a leak and waste notice upon any person having a duty to repair or correct a leak or wasteful condition or upon any person in violation of the rules and regulations for the prevention of the waste of water. Such notice shall specify the repair or correction to be made and shall fix a reasonable time for compliance. Where such notice has been served and water continues to be wasted after the time for correction has expired, the commissioner may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the commissioner or his or her designee, turn off the water supply to the premises or impose a penalty not to exceed fifty dollars per day for each day that water continues to be wasted after the expiration date contained in the notice, or both. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section may be added to the water rents; except that no such penalty may be imposed against any property unless both the leak and waste notice and notice of the proceeding to impose the penalty was served upon the owner by mailing copies thereof to the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills at the address on file for such purpose or where no name appears to the property addressed to "owner" or "agent" and such person has had an opportunity to be heard.

Within one year after the effective date of this section, and annually thereafter, the committee shall submit to the city council a report evaluating the effectiveness of paragraphs a through e, of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of RS 16 describing the latest available water-conserving fixtures, and including written recommendations. The department shall make available to the committee any and all information useful and necessary for the committee to prepare and complete the report for submission to the city council. To prepare such report the committee shall utilize any information and/or materials determined to be pertinent that have been published, distributed or in any other manner made available from state agencies, public and private research groups, multistate agencies such as the Delaware River Basin Commission, and other similar public or private agencies or groups with expertise with respect to water-conserving plumbing fixtures. The report shall include, but not be limited to:

   (1) a review of compliance with paragraphs a through e, of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16 of the appendix to chapter one of title twenty-seven of this code, the impact of such compliance, and the relationship of the standards set forth herein to current technology;

   (2) recommendations as to the feasibility of requiring more stringent water-saving performance standards than provided in paragraphs a through e of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16.

The department shall establish a city-wide comprehensive public information campaign focusing on water-conserving fixtures, the benefits of good water-saving equipment, and the opportunity for rapid pay-back and long-term money savings, especially in energy costs, for home owners and landlords. Within six months after the effective date of this section, a proposal for the public information campaign shall be submitted to the city council for review and commentary. The department shall report annually to the city council on the status of the public information campaign.

It shall be the duty of the commissioner of environmental protection to provide proper police protection to the inhabitants of the localities in which any work may be constructed under the authority of this subchapter during the period of construction, against the acts or omissions of persons employed on such works or found in their neighborhood. To that end the commissioner is authorized and required to appoint a sufficient number of persons to adequately police such localities for such periods. The commissioner shall also have power to remove such persons and to fix or change their compensation in his or her discretion, which compensation shall be paid by the city upon a certificate of the commissioner, as part of the expense authorized to be incurred by this subchapter.

b. The commissioner of environmental protection shall give to each person so appointed a certificate of appointment and certified copies thereof, one of which shall be filed in the office of the sheriff of each county in which any work shall be in process of construction under this subchapter and in which such person shall be authorized to perform that person's duties. Each person so appointed shall be and have all the powers of a peace officer in the county where any work is being constructed under the authority of this subchapter. Such person shall at all times when on duty wear upon his or her clothing or have in his or her possession a shield or other suitable badge of authority which such person shall at once exhibit to any person asking therefor.

c. It shall be the special duty of the persons so appointed to prevent breaches of the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest and bring before the proper magistrates persons employed on such works or found in the vicinity thereof, who are guilty of offenses against the law punishable by death, imprisonment or fines, or persons whom they may have reasonable cause to believe to be guilty of such offenses.

d. The sheriff of a county wherein a certificate of appointment of any such person as a peace officer is filed may cancel such certificate for cause, and shall immediately give notice in writing of such cancellation to the commissioner of environmental protection, specifying the cause of such revocation.

a. The city is hereby required to build and construct such highways and bridges as may be made necessary by the construction of any reservoir under this subchapter, and to repair and forever maintain such additional highways and bridges and to remove the snow and to sand the highway surfaces whenever necessary, except such as shall be part of any state route; and in case any bridge or highway thus constructed shall cross any railroad, it shall do so above or below such railroad and not upon the same level.

Provided, however, that the commissioner of environmental protection shall have no greater authority in respect thereto than is now, or may hereafter be, vested by the highway law of the state of New York in the town, county or state authorities in relation to the construction and regulation of town, county and state highways. Any individual or corporation failing to observe such rules and regulations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition, shall be liable for actual damages to such highways and bridges, to be recovered by the city.

c. The state commissioner of transportation, in his or her discretion, shall have the power to perform, at the request of the commissioner of environmental protection and at the expense of the city, any work of original construction of substituting routes required to be performed by the city pursuant to this section. Whenever the state commissioner of transportation shall grant such a request of the commissioner of environmental protection, he or she shall prepare and submit to such commissioner of environmental protection for his or her approval an estimate of the cost of performing such work. Such estimate of cost shall be an estimate of the cost of performing such work of construction pursuant to plans, designs and specifications prepared by the commissioner of environmental protection and approved by the state commissioner of transportation, and shall include all costs in connection with performing such work, including the costs of engineering, auditing and administration. Upon approval of such estimate by the commissioner of environmental protection, the city shall thereupon deposit with the state comptroller, who is authorized to receive and accept the same, for the purpose of this subdivision, a sum of money equal to such estimate, which shall be subject to the draft or requisition of the state commissioner of transportation and a copy of the resolution of such commissioner of environmental protection authorizing such deposit shall be filed with the state commissioner of transportation and with the state comptroller. If, at any time prior to the award of a contract for the performance of such work or prior to the state commissioner of transportation becoming obligated to award such a contract, it appears to such commissioner of environmental protection that the state commissioner of transportation, for any reason, will be unable to award a contract for the performance of such work or that it is undesirable that such a contract be awarded, any sum or sums so deposited by the city, less the amount of cost which the state commissioner of transportation has already incurred, if any, shall be refunded to the city by the state comptroller upon demand of such commissioner of environmental protection made to the state comptroller and to the state commissioner of transportation. The performance of any such work of construction shall be by contract, to be let, so far as practicable, in the manner provided by section thirty-eight of the highway law, which section shall, so far as practicable, apply to contracts hereunder and payments thereon. Such contract shall be subject to and in conformity with such plans, designs and specifications of the commissioner of environmental protection. No contract shall be executed for any such work until satisfactory proof has been furnished to the state commissioner of transportation that the city has made available any real property required and any easements deemed necessary. When work performed by the state commissioner of transportation hereunder has been completed and the cost thereof paid, the state commissioner of transportation shall render to the commissioner of environmental protection an itemized statement showing in full (a) the amount of money which has been deposited by the city with the state comptroller in connection with such work, and (b) all disbursements made by the state commissioner of transportation in connection with the performance of such work. Any surplus money shall be paid to the city upon the warrant of the state comptroller upon vouchers therefor approved by the state commissioner of transportation.






*§ 24-357 Report to comptroller of expenses and liabilities.* ::


The commissioner of environmental protection shall in every calendar month file in the office of the comptroller an account of any expenses made by the commissioner, or under the commissioner's authority, and of all liabilities incurred by the commissioner during the preceding month and an abstract of each such account shall be published in the City Record.






*§ 24-358 Removal of buildings to prevent contamination of the water supply.* ::


The city or its representatives shall not enter upon any lands not taken in pursuance of subchapter three-A of chapter three of title five for the purpose of preserving streams or watercourses from pollution or contamination, or of moving or causing to be moved any buildings, improvements or edifices on the ground that the same may contaminate the water supply, without making a provision for just compensation to the owner of such buildings or improvements for the removal or destruction thereof.






*§ 24-359 Rights of fishing and ice cutting in lakes and reservoirs preserved; regulation.* ::


Nothing herein contained shall authorize or empower the city to prohibit the public from using such lakes or reservoirs that may be constructed under the provisions of this subchapter, for the purpose of ice-cutting or fishing; and the city, or its representatives, shall not hereafter prohibit the public from using such lakes or reservoirs which are now under the care or supervision of the city for the purposes of ice-cutting or fishing, subject, however, to reasonable rules and regulations, and subject however, to the right of the city to prohibit such use in the event of the declaration of an emergency as provided in section 24-326 of this code.

a. It shall be lawful for any of the municipal corporations or water districts in the counties of Ulster, Greene, Delaware, Schoharie, Sullivan, Orange, Westchester and Putnam, and for the village of Deposit in the counties of Delaware and Broome, to take and receive from any of the reservoirs, aqueducts, conduits, streams or pipes of the city a supply of water for the uses and purposes of such municipal corporations or water districts or village and to that end such municipal corporations or water districts are, and each of them is, and such village also is, authorized and empowered to lay the necessary mains, pipes, valves, hydrants, supply pipes and other necessary appurtenances for the use of such water, without the consent of any board, officer, bureau, or department of the state or any subdivision thereof.

b. The connections with such reservoirs, aqueducts, conduits, streams or pipes shall be made at the expense of such municipalities or water districts. They shall pay to the city such fair and reasonable water charges or rates as may be agreed upon between the commissioner of environmental protection and the authorities of such municipal corporations or water districts or as from time to time upon the application of either party shall be fixed by the New York state department of environmental conservation, which department is hereby given power to fix such fair and reasonable charges or rates after hearing all parties interested. The expenses of any such hearing and decision by the New York state department of environmental conservation shall be paid by the applicant. Bills for such expenses shall be certified by such department to the applicant and paid by the applicant directly to the claimant within thirty days of the date of such cer- tification.

c. Such charges or rates shall not, however, exceed the charges or rates now charged by the city to persons using water in that city. Such fair and reasonable charges or rates shall be determined on the basis of the actual total cost of the water to the city after deducting from the total cost all construction costs and expenses of operation, maintenance and carrying charges incurred within the corporate limits of the city in connection with the distribution and delivery of the water within such limits.

______________________________________

Corporation counsel of the city of New York."

2. Not less than sixty days after the last publication date of said notice, the corporation counsel shall make an application to a special term of the supreme court in the same judicial district in which the cemetery or burial place is located for an order authorizing such removal of said remains, monuments and all other distinguishing marks to a cemetery or burial place in the same or an adjoining county from that in which said cemetery or burial place is located. Such order shall be made upon due proof of not less than ten days' notice to interested parties who have appeared by attorney, or who have filed appearances in writing with the corporation counsel, and of proof of publication of notice of such application once in each week for four weeks in each of two newspapers published in the county where such cemetery or burial place is situated, immediately prior to application to the supreme court. Such notice shall briefly set forth the time and place of the making of such application and a designation of the cemetery or burial place to which said remains, monuments and distinguishing marks are sought to be removed. All removals and transportation of such human remains shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the public health law and the local rules or ordinances of any town, city or village wherein such cemetery or burial place is located, or wherein any of such remains may be interred. The commissioner of environmental protection on behalf of the city may acquire by purchase such other lands as may be necessary within the county where such cemetery or burial place is located, or in an adjoining county, for the purpose of properly interring such removed remains, which lands shall be acquired with the approval of the supreme court in the same judicial district as that in which the condemnation proceedings were originally instituted. In the acquisition of such lands no cemetery or burial place shall be divided and the acreage acquired must be at least substantially equal to the acreage taken. The commissioner of environmental protection on behalf of the city may also acquire other lands within the county wherein such cemetery or burial place is located, or in an adjoining county, for the purpose of properly interring and removing such remains, in the same manner as provided by this subchapter for the acquisition of water supply and other lands but such acquisition of such lands shall be subject to approval of the supreme court. No lands shall be acquired within the corporate limits of a village or city except within the bounds of an existing cemetery unless by consent of the board of trustees of the village or common council of the city or other authorities within such village or city occupying similar positions as trustees or aldermen, respectively. The supreme court, upon application for the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, shall make inquiry as to the rights of individual lot owners in cemeteries and provide for the protection of such rights as justice shall require. All the bodies removed by said commissioner of environmental protection shall, when distinguishable, be encased each in a separate box or coffin, and each monument, head stone, foot stone, slab, board or other designating or distinguishing mark shall be properly removed and reset at the grave of each body at the time of such reinterment. Members of the same family shall be reinterred in contiguous graves. Whenever any person or persons, legally entitled to direct as to the disposition of any human remains now interred in a cemetery or burial place, shall request, in writing, within the sixty day period aforesaid, the burial of such remains in a cemetery in the same or an adjoining county, the commissioner shall cause such remains to be reinterred where requested within the same county or in adjoining county, and shall carefully and properly remove such remains to such burial plot and properly reinter the same, and in the event that any human remains be removed to, and reinterred in any other place other than that acquired as herein provided, no portion of the expense for the acquisition of any other grave, graves, or other place or places of burial shall be borne by the city, but in such event the city shall bear only the expense of removal and transportation of such remains. Whenever there is no request to remove remains within the sixty day period as hereinbefore provided, the corporation counsel shall apply for an order authorizing such removal in the manner herein provided. Whenever any person or persons legally entitled to direct as to the disposition of any human remains exhumed or to be exhumed from any cemetery or burial place as herein provided, elect to remove the same for reinterment to any burial plot or cemetery not within the same county from which such remains were exhumed, or in an adjoining county, such person or persons so entitled to designate such other burial place or plot shall be permitted to remove such exhumed remains from such county, subject to the provisions of the public health law, and the local rules or ordinances of any town, city or village wherein such cemetery or burial place shall be located, or wherein such human remains may be reinterred, but no portion of the expense of such transportation or burial shall be borne by the commissioner of environmental protection. When any lands acquired for the purposes of reinterment of human remains as herein provided, to which shall have been removed all remains exhumed from a cemetery or burial place belonging to an individual or individuals, or to a corporation organized under the religious corporations law, the not-for-profit corporation law or by special act, or belonging to a town, village or city, the board of estimate of the city of New York shall, after reinterment, execute and deliver, without expense to the prior owner, if an individual, or if such prior owner be a corporation, to the trustees or other governing body of such corporation, by whatsoever name or title they may hold office, or to the board of trustees, if any, of a town burial ground, and to their successors in office, a quit claim deed covering the lands so acquired, together with all structures erected thereon, and where lands have been acquired for the purpose of reinterment of human remains exhumed from a public or private cemetery or burial place which shall have been used by the inhabitants of any town in this state as a cemetery or burial place for the space of fourteen years and not having a board of trustees pursuant to the provisions of the town law, the board of estimate of the city of New York shall, after reinterment, execute and deliver, and without expense to the grantee therefor a quit claim deed or other proper release to such town wherein such lands so acquired as provided by this section may be situated, and such cemetery or burial place shall from and after the execution and delivery thereof be deemed to be vested in such town, and shall be subject, in the same manner as other corporate property of towns, to the government and direction of directors in town meeting, excepting, however, that where such lands so acquired for the purposes set forth in this section are situated within the limits of a village or city, such quit claim deed or release herein provided for shall be executed and delivered to such village or city and thereafter be and become property of such village or city and subject to the laws governing such village or city. From and after the execution and delivery by the board of estimate as by this section provided, of the quit claim deed or release, the city of New York shall be divested of all right and title to said lands so quit claimed or released and shall not thereafter be liable for the care, custody, maintenance and control thereof. This section does not limit any existing right of burial or removal of remains under other provisions of law applicable thereto. Nothing herein contained shall impose any duty whatsoever upon the city of New York for the care, custody, maintenance and control of any burial grounds, cemeteries or other places of interment for human remains.

Within 10 business days of receiving such notification, the department shall determine whether the location of such activity is in close proximity to critical infrastructure, as defined in rules promulgated by the department, and notify the owner of the premises, engineer, architect or contractor of such determination. If the department determines that the location of such activity is in close proximity to critical infrastructure, the owner of the premises, engineer, architect or contractor shall obtain a permit from the department prior to commencement of such activity. The issuance of any permit or approval by any agency of the city other than the department for such activity shall not relieve the owner of the premises, engineer, architect or contractor of the obligation to comply with the notification and permitting requirements of this section. The department may promulgate a rule waiving or amending the notification and permitting requirements of this section where the department determines that such activity must be performed on an emergency basis.

b. 1. The department may issue a stop work order whenever the department finds that any soil or foundation work in violation of this section or any rules promulgated thereunder creates a danger to critical infrastructure.

   2. Such order shall be posted at the site of the soil or foundation work and served personally on or mailed to the owner or developer or to the person executing the work at the site or the agent of any of them. When there is an immediate danger to critical infrastructure, a verbal order to stop work may be given followed promptly by a written order in accordance with this subdivision.

   3. Upon issuance of a stop work order, work specified in the order shall immediately cease, except work authorized or required by the commissioner to make the site safe.

   4. No person shall, with knowledge or notice of a stop work order, allow, authorize, promote, continue or cause to be continued any work covered by the stop work order, except work authorized or required by the commissioner to make the site safe.

The commissioner may by rule require the payment of a fee in the amount of the expense of additional inspection and administrative expense related to such stop work order.

   6. It shall be unlawful to tamper with, remove or deface a written posted stop work order from the location where it was affixed unless and until such stop work order has been rescinded by the commissioner.

*§ 24-406 Removal of electric wires; Manhattan and the Bronx.* ::


a. After the grade of any street in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx shall have been finally determined and established, whenever, in the opinion of the board of estimate it shall be practicable to remove the electrical conductors above ground in such street and place them underground, the commissioner of transportation shall notify the owners or operators of such conductors. Notice shall be to the effect that such electrical conductors must be removed within a certain time, sufficient for removal, which shall be fixed by such commissioner. In the case of a corporation duly authorized to lay and operate electrical conductors underground in such street, the time shall be sufficient for the proper laying of conductors underground in place of those removed.

b. All electrical conductors authorized to be placed underground, shall be so placed under and in accordance with the provisions of sections 24-410 through 24-415 of the code. Whenever application shall be made to the commissioner of transportation for permission to place underground electrical conductors in any such street, if such permission be granted, the subways therefor shall be constructed or provided, and such electrical conductors placed underground under and in accordance with the provisions of such sections. Such permission shall be granted only in accordance with the provisions of such sections.






*§ 24-407 Underground electrical conductors; Manhattan and the Bronx.* ::


Any company, operating or intending to operate electrical conductors in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, if it shall desire or be required to place its conductors or any of them underground in any of the streets of such boroughs, must remove such conductors from the surface of such streets, when duly authorized so to do. It shall be obligatory upon such company to file with the commissioner of transportation a map or maps, made to scale, showing the streets which are desired to be used for such purpose, and giving the general location, dimensions and course of the underground conduits desired to be constructed. Before any such conduits shall be constructed, it shall be necessary to obtain the approval of such commissioner of transportation of the plan of construction proposed by such company. The commissioner of transportation has and shall have power to require that the work of removal and of constructing every such system of underground conductors shall be done according to such plan so approved, subject at all times to such modifications as shall be made by him or her from time to time, and subject also to such rules and regulations as may be promulgated by him.






*§ 24-408 Electrical conductors; Manhattan and the Bronx; duties of commissioner of transportation.* ::


a. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to carefully investigate any and all methods proposed by any company for electric lighting or electrical communication by the use of conductors along or across any street in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, and, before approving of any such method, such commissioner of transportation shall require that, so far as practicable, all such conductors when constructed shall be underground. The commissioner of transportation shall have full authority to compel all companies operating electric wires to use the subway prepared in accordance with the provisions of sections 24-407 through 24-409 of the code.

b. Wherever, along the streets, in sparsely inhabited or unoccupied portions of such boroughs, the public interests do not require the electrical conductors to be placed underground, and wherever, in any other locality in such boroughs, it is deemed by such commissioner to be, for any cause, impracticable to construct and successfully operate underground the electrical conductors required by any such company, then, it shall be the duty of such commissioner to examine and grant the application of any such company for permission to deviate from such underground system. The commissioner of transportation shall not, however, grant any such permission unless he or she shall be satisfied, upon investigation, that such a permit should be granted for one of the reasons stated above, and that it will not interfere with the successful working of underground conductors elsewhere in such boroughs. Any such permit shall be held and construed to authorize the construction and maintenance of the lines of conductors therein provided for, as and where prescribed by the commissioner of transportation.

c. It is hereby made the duty of such commissioner of transportation, in granting any such permit for other than underground electrical connections, to bear in mind the policy and purpose of sections 24-407 through 24-409 of the code, which is to convert the overhead systems of electrical wires and cables now in use in such boroughs to underground systems, as soon as possible, without impairing the efficiency of their service, and to require that, as far as practicable, all electrical conductors in any street in such boroughs shall be removed from the surface and placed and operated underground, as soon as may be consistent with the convenient use thereof by the public. It is intended to authorize other than underground electrical conductors, to be used in the streets, only when and where the public interests do not require the electrical conductors to be placed underground, or when and where it shall be deemed by the board of estimate to be impracticable to place and operate the conductors advantageously underground. It is also intended to make all aerial or other electrical connections merely incidental to such underground methods, and to require that they be authorized only when and where needed for the convenient use of the public or where the underground conductors can be made more useful thereby.

d. The work of constructing every line of conductors authorized by any such permit, so granted, shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner of transportation. Every such permit shall specify the location of the structures to be erected and to be used for sustaining the electrical conductors, and shall give the general dimensions thereof.

e. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to require that the subway may be used by the city for the electric wires or conductors operated by its police, fire or other agencies without expense, except that of the wires or conductors. The city shall not, however, be compelled to place any such wires or conductors underground until the money has been specifically raised therefor, and until that time the city may continue to use and extend such wires.






*§ 24-409 Aerial electrical wires or cables; regulation.* ::


Whenever the commissioner of transportation shall permit any aerial electrical wires or cables, carried along or across and above the surface of any of the streets of such boroughs, to be crossed by aerial electrical wires or cables, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to designate also, in such permit, the route and location thereof, and to prescribe and regulate the height at which such wires or cables shall be placed. Whenever any such permit shall be granted by the commissioner of transportation, in extending the connections of any subterranean electrical conductors, for the erection of any structure or structures for sustaining electrical conductors above the surface of any street, or for placing wires or cables on any such structure or elsewhere than underground, or for carrying any such wires or cables across or along and above the surface of any street, or for placing wires or cables on any such structure or elsewhere than underground, or for carrying any such wires or cables over or into or in the rear of any building in such boroughs, any and all such structures, and any and all such wires or cables, shall be so erected and maintained as not to interfere with the other public uses of such streets.






*§ 24-410 Construction of conduits; removal of poles, wires.* ::


Whenever, in the opinion of the commissioner of transportation, a sufficient construction of conduits or subways under ground shall be made ready under the provisions of sections 24-410 through 24-414 of the code, in any street or locality in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, reference being had to the general direction and vicinity of the electrical conductors then in use overhead, the commissioner of transportation shall notify the owners or operators of the electrical conductors above ground in such street or locality. The notice shall inform them that they are to make such electrical connections in such street or through other streets, localities or parts of such boroughs with such underground conduits or subways as shall be determined by such commissioner of transportation, and to remove poles, wires, or other electrical conductors above ground and their supporting fixtures or other devices from such street and locality within ninety days after notice to such effect shall be given.






*§ 24-411 Removal of abandoned poles.* ::


a. All telegraph, telephone and electric light poles, wires or conductors which shall hereafter remain or stand disused, or become disused or abandoned, in, or over or upon any street, shall be forthwith removed, but for sufficient cause shown the commissioner of transportation may extend the time for such removal, by one or more orders, for periods not exceeding one year each.

b. The persons owning, operating, managing or controlling poles, wires or appurtenances which may have been so disused or abandoned, or which may be dangerous or unsafe, shall take down and remove them, and upon their failure to do so, the commissioner of transportation shall remove the same forthwith, at the expense of such persons. Before such removal, the commissioner of transportation, except where a condition of danger exists, shall mail a notice thereof to the last known address of such persons, a copy of which shall be posted for a period of ten days on each of such poles prior to its removal.

c. Any person convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $750 dollars, imprisonment for not more than ten days, or both. In addition to or as an alternative to such penalty, such person shall also be subject to a civil penalty of no less than nor more than $100 per day such person is in violation of any provision of this section. Such civil penalties shall be imposed in the manner set forth in section 19-150.








*§ 24-412 Agreement with Consolidated Telegraph and Electrical Subway Company; new contracts.* ::


The agreement made by and between the commissioners of electrical subways or the commissioner of water supply, gas and electricity for the city of New York and the Consolidated Telegraph and Electrical Subway Company or its successor by merger, the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, under date of July twenty-seventh, eighteen hundred eighty-six, when and as amended and modified by a second and further contract or agreement between these parties, dated the seventh day of April, eighteen hundred eighty-seven, is hereby ratified and confirmed, subject, however to all the provisions of sections 24-410 through 24-414 of the code.

   1. The term "agency having jurisdiction" shall mean the department of environmental protection.

   2. The term "curb-to-sewer connection" shall mean the connection from the curb line to the sewer or to a sewer riser constructed with the sewer.

   3. The term "cost" shall mean the actual cost of constructing each sewer-to-curb connection.

   4. The term "curb line" shall mean the curb line determined pursuant to the resolution of the board of estimate establishing street and roadway widths.

b. The owner of any parcel of real property to be connected with the sewer system shall pay the cost of each curb-to-sewer connection serving such real property, if such curb-to-sewer connection was or shall be constructed in connection with the construction, reconstruction or replacement of a sewer duly authorized on or after January first, nineteen hundred sixty-two. Such cost shall become due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property when the amount thereof shall have been computed by the agency having jurisdiction and an entry thereof shall have been made against such premises in the office of the city collector in the book in which charges for curb-to-sewer connections are to be entered. A notice thereof, stating the amount due and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector, within five days after such entry, to the last known address of the person whose name appears upon the records in the office of the city collector as being the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills or where no name appears, to the premises addressed to either the owner or the agent, together with a statement that if such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date of entry the amount thereof with interest thereon at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry, will constitute, until paid, a lien against the premises which shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax, water rent, sewer rent, sewer surcharge or local assessment. If such charge is not paid within ninety days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to collect and receive interest thereon at the rate of seven percent per annum, to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. Such charge and the interest thereon shall continue to be, until paid, a lien on the premises served by such curb-to-sewer connection. Such charge and interest shall be calculated and the lien thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the collection and foreclosure of the lien of taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents due and payable to the city, and the provisions of the code applicable to the collection and foreclosure of the lien of such taxes, sewer rents, sewer surcharges and water rents shall apply to such charge and the interest thereon and the lien thereof.

*§ 24-514 Sewer rents.* ::


a. Sewer system, defined. As used in this section the term "sewer system" shall mean and include the sewers, manholes, intercepting sewers, sewage pumping, treatment and disposal works, and any other plants, works or equipment and accessories within the city, which are used or useful in connection with the collection, treatment or disposal of sewage and waste, and which are owned, operated or maintained by the city as part of the public sewer system.

b. Imposition and computation of sewer rent or charge.

   1. In addition to any other fees or charges provided by law, the owner of any parcel of real property connected with the sewer system, including but not limited to real property connected with the sewer system by means of a private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, shall pay a sewer rent or charge for the use of the sewer system. Such rent or charge shall be based on the water supplied to any such real property as measured by the amount charged for such water, except as otherwise provided by this section. Such rent or charge shall be computed by the commissioner of environmental protection in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   2. For any such property supplied with water from the municipal water supply system the sewer rent or charge shall be equal in amount to sixty percent of the charges for water supplied to such property from such system.

   3. For any such property supplied with water by a private water company, the commissioner of environmental protection shall, by rule and regulation, subject to the approval of the board of estimate, fix the fraction of the charges for such water, which shall constitute the sewer rent for such property, so that the sewer rent or charge for such property shall, as nearly as possible, be equivalent to the sewer rent or charge imposed under paragraph two of this subdivision for property supplied with water from the municipal water supply system.

   4. If any such property is supplied with river water or water from private wells, the sewer rent or charge for such property shall be equal in amount to sixty percent of the amount that would be charged for the quantity of water supplied from such sources if such water were supplied by the city at the rates charged for water supplied to metered premises. The commissioner of environmental protection shall estimate the quantity of water supplied from such sources and shall compute the sewer rent or charge, on the basis of such estimated quantity, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. However, if a water meter, approved by the commissioner of environmental protection, has been or shall be installed by the owner or occupant of the premises to measure the quantity of water supplied from such sources, the quantity of water measured by such meter shall constitute the basis for computing the sewer rent or charge in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. In the event that such property supplied with river water or water from private wells is also supplied with water from the municipal water supply system or by a private water company, the sewer rent or charge for such property shall consist of the rent or charge computed pursuant to this paragraph and the rent or charges computed in accordance with paragraph two or three of this subdivision as the case may be.

   5. The commissioner of environmental protection shall have the power to promulgate rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the board of estimate, prescribing reasonable sewer rents or charges for any such property which is used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that water supplied to it cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system. The sewer rent or charges prescribed pursuant to this paragraph shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system as estimated by the commissioner of environmental protection, or where an estimate of such amount is impracticable, upon any other basis bearing a reasonable relationship to the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system.

c. Additional rule making powers. The commissioner of environmental protection shall have the power to make such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations shall be subject to approval by the board of estimate.

d. Cooperation by private persons, water companies, and public agencies. The commissioner of environmental protection may require every person who owns or occupies real property within the city, every private water company supplying water to property within the city, and all municipal agencies, officers, and employees to furnish him or her with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Every such person, water company, or municipal agency, officer, or employee shall cooperate with the commissioner of environmental protection in carrying out the provisions of this section and shall comply with all rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Such commissioner shall have the power to hold such hearings and to subpoena such witnesses and direct the production of such books and papers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

e. Exemptions from sewer rents or charges. Any real property which is entitled to an exemption from the payment of water rents or charges shall also be exempt from payment of the sewer rents or charges imposed hereunder.

f. Payment and enforcement of sewer rents or charges. All sewer rents or charges imposed hereunder shall be due and payable at the times and in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the code. Such rents or charges shall constitute a lien upon the real property served by the sewer system and such lien shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax, water rent or local assessment. Such rents or charges shall be collected and the liens thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of this code.

g. Sewer fund. The revenues derived from the sewer rentals imposed hereunder, including penalties and interest thereon, shall be kept in a separate and distinct fund to be known as the sewer fund. Such fund shall be used for the payment of the cost of the management, maintenance, operation and repair of the sewer system, the cost of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the cost of collection of the sewer rents or charges imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section, and any surplus in such fund shall be used for the payment of the interest and amortization on any debt which has been or shall be incurred for the construction of intercepting sewers and sewage treatment and disposal works, and for the enlargement, replacement, or addition of intercepting sewers or sewage treatment works. However, such funds shall not be used for the extension of sewers to serve unsewered areas.

In applying such formula the commissioner may use, as the figure representing the number of cubic feet of sewage discharged into the sewer system, (A) the amount of water supplied to the premises by the city or a private water company as shown upon the water meter if the premises are metered, or (B) if the premises are supplied with river water or water from private wells, the amount of water supplied from such sources as estimated by the commissioner, pursuant to paragraph four of subdivision b of section 24-514 of this chapter, or (C) if such premises are used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that the water supplied to the premises cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system, the estimate of the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system made by the commissioner, pursuant to the provisions of paragraph five of subdivision b of section 24-514 of the code, or (D) the number of cubic feet of sewage discharged into the sewer system as determined by measurements and samples taken at a manhole installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer system at his or her own expense in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this method, or (E) a figure determined by the commissioner by any combination of the foregoing or by any other equitable method.

c. 1. The commissioner may require that a permit be obtained for the discharge whether direct or indirect into the sewer system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, of sewage, industrial wastes or other wastes, the characteristics of which do not conform to the characteristics prescribed for normal sewage in accordance with the provisions of paragraph ten of subdivision a of this section or for the discharge of any toxic substance or any other objectionable material or substance specified by the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to subdivision e of this section. The commissioner, in his or her discretion, may require a permit for all such discharges or for any class or category of such discharges. Any discharge pursuant to such permit shall be upon such terms and conditions as may be established by the commissioner in the issuance of such permit. Such terms and conditions may include requirements of a limitation upon the volume of sewage and the rate of flow permitted from the premises which are the subject of the permit, the installation and maintenance by the permittee at his or her own expense of facilities or equipment for intermittent or continuous measurement of sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged into the sewer system from such premises, the installation and maintenance by the permittee, at his or her own expense, of detention tanks or other facilities or equipment for reducing the maximum rates of discharge of sewage to such percentage of the twenty-four hour rate as may be required by the commissioner, the installation and maintenance by the permittee, at his or her own expense of such preliminary treatment facilities as may be required by the commissioner, the installation and maintenance by the permittee, at his or her own expense, of a suitable control manhole in the house sewer, if any, carrying such sewage; the submission to and approval by the commissioner of the plans for any of the facilities or equipment required to be installed and maintained by the permittee pursuant to such terms and conditions; and such other terms and conditions as may be necessary to protect the sewer system and carry out the provisions of this section. Such terms and conditions may also provide that subsequent to the commencement of operation of any preliminary treatment facilities required by the commissioner, periodic reports shall be made by the permittee to the commissioner, setting forth adequate data upon which the acceptability of the sewage, industrial waste or other wastes, after treatment, may be determined. A violation by the permittee of any term or condition of the permit shall constitute cause for revocation or suspension of the permit.

   2. Whenever required to carry out the provisions of this section and the regulations promulgated pursuant to this section, the commissioner may require any person discharging directly or indirectly into the sewer system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system to (i) establish and maintain such records, (ii) make such reports, (iii) install, use and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods (including where appropriate biological monitoring methods) (iv) sample such effluents (in accordance with such methods, at such locations, at such intervals and in such manner as the commissioner shall prescribe) and (v) provide such other information as he or she may reasonably require.

   3. Any person discharging directly or indirectly into the sewer system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, shall be deemed to have consented and agreed that the commissioner or his or her deputies or such other officers or employees as are authorized by the commissioner may enter on the premises from which such discharge is emitted or in which any records required to be maintained under paragraph two are located and may at reasonable times have access to and copy any records, inspect any monitoring equipment or method required under paragraph two and sample any effluents discharged from the premises to the sewer system.

   4. It shall be unlawful to make any false statement, representation or certification in any application, record, report, plan, or other document filed with or required to be maintained by the commissioner or to falsify, tamper with or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method required to be maintained by the commissioner.

d. Sampling of industrial wastes. Whenever sewage, industrial waste or other waste which has characteristics which do not conform to the characteristics prescribed for normal sewage or receivable industrial waste pursuant to paragraphs ten and eleven of subdivision a of this section, or which contains toxic substances or other material or substance excluded from the sewer system by the commissioner pursuant to this section is discharged into the sewer system from any premises, the commissioner shall have the power to take such samples and tests as may be necessary to determine the nature and concentration of such wastes, and shall have the power to reassess his or her findings by taking such additional samples or tests at any time or by periodic rechecks without notice to the owner or person discharging such wastes. Samples shall be taken and flow measurements made, whenever possible, at a common manhole into which all flows of sewage, industrial waste or other waste from such premises are combined. Such manhole shall be constructed by the owner of such premises, at his or her own expense, when directed by order of the commissioner. Whenever the installation of such a manhole is impossible or impracticable, the owner of such premises shall construct and maintain at his or her own expense, any additional manholes required by order of the commissioner, for accurate measurement of all flow of sewage, industrial waste or other wastes discharged from such premises into the sewer system. Failure to comply with an order of the commissioner issued pursuant to this subdivision may subject the premises to temporary termination of water supply in accordance with the provisions of section 11-314 of the code.

e. Rules and regulations.

   1. The commissioner shall have the power to promulgate rules and regulations:

      (a) identifying toxic substances and regulating, restricting or prohibiting the discharge of such substances into the sewer system in amounts or concentrations which may cause any of the adverse effects described in paragraph thirteen of subdivision a of this section;

      (b) regulating, restricting or prohibiting the discharge into the sewer system of any material or substance which is or may be detrimental or destructive to the sewer system or the treatment processes thereof or to the public health or welfare;

      (c) specifying the characteristics and the minimum and maximum amounts thereof, in addition to those specified in paragraph eleven of subdivision a hereof, for receivable industrial waste;

      (d) such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary to protect personnel, the sewer system and the treatment process thereof and the receiving waters; and

      (e) regulating the amount and concentration of substances contained in industrial waste discharged directly or indirectly into the sewer system to achieve compliance with effluent limitations imposed upon city discharges to receiving waters by federal or state law or regulation or a discharge permit issued pursuant thereto.

   2. The commissioner shall by rule or regulation adopt the standards, prohibitions and requirements promulgated under the federal water pollution control act, commonly referred to as the clean water act, as amended, except where such standards, prohibitions and requirements are less stringent than those which are established by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph one or three of this subdivision.

   3. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, the commissioner may order any person discharging a toxic substance directly or indirectly into the sewer system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system to reduce the amount or concentration of such toxic substance to a level which the commissioner determines to be economically achievable by the discharger notwithstanding that such level is lower than that which is prescribed in the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph one or two or that the discharge is not regulated under such provision. Within twenty days after the issuance of an order by the commissioner, any person affected by such order may request a hearing before the commissioner. The commissioner may suspend, revoke or modify the order.

f. Cooperation by private persons, water companies and public agencies. The commissioner may require every person who owns or occupies real property within the city and every private water company supplying water to property within the city, to furnish him or her with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. The commissioner shall have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena any such persons or company, or any officer, employee or agent of any such company, and direct the production of books and papers in order to carry out the provisions of this section. Every such person, water company or public official or municipal agency, officer or employee shall cooperate with the commissioner in carrying out the provisions of this section and shall comply with all rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section.

g. Payment and enforcement of sewer surcharges. All surcharges imposed hereunder shall be due and payable at the times and in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the code with respect to the payment of sewer rents based upon the metered supply of water. Such sewer surcharges shall constitute a lien upon the real property served by the sewage system and such lien shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax, water rent, sewer rent or local assessment. Such sewer surcharges shall be collected and the liens thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the code. The revenues derived from the sewer surcharges imposed hereunder, including penalties and interest thereon shall be paid into the sewer fund established pursuant to section 24-514 of the code and shall be used in the manner and for the purposes provided therein.

Chapter 5-A: Water Pollution Control
--------------------------------------------------




**Subchapter 1: General**



*§ 24-540 Policy.* ::


Land development and associated increases in site impervious cover increase stormwater runoff causing flooding, soil erosion, and sediment transport and deposition in waterways. A high percentage of impervious area correlates with a higher rate of stormwater runoff, which generates greater pollutant loadings to the city’s separate stormwater and combined sewer systems. Pollutants found in urban runoff include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, phosphorus, silt and sediment, pathogens, floatables, petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

Clearing and grading during construction may increase soil erosion and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Improperly designed and constructed stormwater management practices increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from land development activities. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance standards governing long-term stormwater management and site design produces development compatible with the natural functions of a particular site and thereby mitigates the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.

Material handling and storage, equipment maintenance and cleaning, and other activities at industrial facilities are often exposed to stormwater, which can pick up pollutants and transport them to surface waters directly or via a storm sewer. Appropriate stormwater management at industrial facilities can reduce these impacts.

This chapter establishes stormwater management controls meeting the requirements of state and federal law in areas of the city where stormwater does not pass through wastewater treatment plants before it enters the waters of the state. In these areas water borne pollutants in stormwater runoff are more likely to enter and have an adverse impact on the waters of the state.

The purpose and intent of this chapter is to (i) reduce pollutants discharged in stormwater runoff from construction activities in such areas to the maximum extent practicable through appropriate erosion and sediment controls; (ii) minimize, to the maximum extent practicable, increases in stormwater runoff volume and velocity, and pollutant loading in stormwater runoff, from development sites in such areas; (iii) ensure the proper maintenance of post-construction stormwater management practices; and (iv) ensure compliance by certain industrial facilities in such areas with applicable requirements to manage stormwater runoff in order to reduce pollutants in stormwater from industrial activities to the maximum extent practicable.

Chapter 10: Environmental Hazard Remediation.
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 24-1000 Declaration of policy.* ::


It is hereby declared that asthma and other respiratory conditions have increased significantly in the United States and that evidence suggests that indoor environments, where most people spend a majority of their time, play an important role in predisposing vulnerable populations to asthma and other respiratory diseases. The National Academy of Sciences found that there was sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between a number of respiratory conditions and the presence of asthma triggers, irritants, pathogens, fungi and mold, including stachybotrys chartarum, soot from severe smoke or fire damage and flood damage, mold or environmental pathogens including bird or bat droppings or potentially infectious materials as defined by 29 CFR 1910, including H1N1, viruses, bacteria, blood borne pathogens, chemical spills, and sewage. Vulnerable populations such as those with profound immune-suppression, obstructive or cavity lung diseases, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma exacerbated by moldy materials, pneumonitis, are at particular risk. A highly trained workforce with skills across individual hazard and remediation method techniques will help to address multiple and common hazards in a safe manner. Further, in times of crisis, both natural and manmade, profiteers and other unscrupulous persons have historically taken advantage of victims. An approved master environmental hazard remediation technician registration program would result in a uniform standard of training that would allow the citizens of New York city to have confidence that environmental hazard remediation is done efficiently, effectively and safely.

Therefore, the council finds that it is in the best interests of the city to create a voluntary master environmental hazard remediation technician registration program which would recognize those who are sufficiently trained to hold themselves out as a master environmental hazard remediation technician.

Each program or course shall be presented by an instructor or institution authorized by the respective governing authority to conduct such training.

"Environmental hazard remediation" means the removal, cleaning, sanitizing, treatment or implementation of other preventive actions to eliminate environmental hazards.

"Master environmental hazard remediation technician identification" means a written document issued by the commissioner certifying that a person is registered with the department pursuant to this chapter.

"Master environmental hazard remediation technician" means a person registered with the department upon successfully presenting to the commissioner current documentation of having successfully completed required environmental remediation training programs or courses from a department approved training provider as evidenced from a certificate of completion.
