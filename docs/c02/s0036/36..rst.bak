Section 36. ::    
        
     
        § 36. Local laws; passage. No local law shall be passed until it shall
      have been in its final form and upon the desks of the council members at
      least  seven  calendar  days,  exclusive  of Sundays, prior to its final
      passage, unless the mayor shall have certified as to the  necessity  for
      its  immediate  passage  and such local law be passed by the affirmative
      vote of two-thirds of all the council members.
        For purposes of this section, a local law shall be deemed to  be  upon
      the  desks  of  the  council  members  if:  it is set forth in a legible
      electronic format by electronic means, and it is available for review in
      such format at the desks of the members. For purposes  of  this  section
      "electronic  means"  means  any  method  of  transmission of information
      between computers or other machines designed for the purpose of  sending
      and  receiving  such  transmissions  and  which: allows the recipient to
      reproduce  the  information  transmitted  in  a   tangible   medium   of
      expression; and does not permit additions, deletions or other changes to
      be made without leaving an adequate record thereof.
