        §  43.  Special  meetings.  The  mayor  may  at  any time call special
      meetings of the council. He shall also call a  special  meeting  when  a
      requisition  for  that  purpose  signed by five council members has been
      presented to him. Not less than one day  before  a  special  meeting  is
      held,  notice  of  the  time  thereof and of the business proposed to be
      transacted, signed by the mayor, shall be published in the City  Record,
      and at the same time the city clerk shall cause a copy of such notice to
      be left at or sent by post to the usual place of abode or of business of
      each  council  member;  but want of service of a notice upon any council
      member shall not affect the validity of the meeting. No  business  shall
      be  transacted at such special meetings other than that specified in the
      notice relating thereto.
