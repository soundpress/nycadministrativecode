Section 25. ::    
        
     
        §  25.  Election;  term;  vacancies.  a.  The council members shall be
      elected  at  the  general  election  in  the   year   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-seven and every fourth year thereafter and the term of office of
      each council member shall commence on the first day of January after the
      elections  and  shall  continue  for  four  years  thereafter; provided,
      however, that the council member elected at the general election in  the
      year two thousand and one and at the general election in every twentieth
      year  thereafter  shall  serve for a term of two years commencing on the
      first day of January after such election; and provided further  that  an
      additional  election  of  Council  Members  shall be held at the general
      election in the year two thousand three  and  at  the  general  election
      every  twentieth  year  thereafter  and that the members elected at each
      such additional election shall serve for a term of two  years  beginning
      on the first day of January after such election.
        Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this charter or other law, a
      full term of two years, as established by  this  subsection,  shall  not
      constitute  a  full term under section 1138 of this charter, except that
      two consecutive full terms of two years shall constitute one  full  term
      under  section  1138.  A member of the council who resigns or is removed
      from office prior to the completion of a full term shall  be  deemed  to
      have  held  that  office for a full term for purposes of section 1138 of
      the charter.
        b. Any vacancy which may occur among  the  council  members  shall  be
      filled by popular election in the following manner.
        1.  Within  three  days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the council,
      the mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required
      by this subdivision, provide notice of such  proclamation  to  the  city
      clerk  and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City
      Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election  to  be  held
      pursuant  to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk
      shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week  preceding
      the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and
      the  board  of  elections  shall  mail  notice  of  such election to all
      registered voters within the district in which the  election  is  to  be
      held.
        2.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
      term or the first year of a two-year term, a general  election  to  fill
      the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the
      year  in  which  the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the
      last day on which an occurring vacancy may  be  filled  at  the  general
      election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such
      election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116
      of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in  any  year  after  such
      last  day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at
      the general election in the following year provided,  however,  that  no
      general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the
      term,  except  as  provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party
      nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a  vacancy  for
      the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election,
      except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision.
        3.  If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim
      basis has not been previously held pursuant  to  paragraphs  four,  six,
      seven  and  eight  of  this  subdivision, the person elected to fill the
      vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at  a  general  election
      shall  take  office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until
      the term expires. If a special or general election to fill  the  vacancy
      on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
      the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general
    
      election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
      general election and shall serve until the term expires.
        4.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
      term or in the first year of a two-year term and on or before  the  last
      day in the third year of such a four-year term or the first year of such
      a  two-year  term  on  which  an occurring vacancy may be filled for the
      remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  with  party
      nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, a special or
      general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be  held,
      unless  the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary
      election at which party nominations for a general election to  fill  the
      vacancy  may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring
      vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  the
      general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party
      nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law.
        5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day  in  the  third  year  of  a
      four-year  term  or  the  first  year  of  a  two-year  term on which an
      occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
      at  a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates
      for such election being made at  a  primary  election,  as  provided  in
      section  6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before
      the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such a  four-year
      term  or  the  second year of such a two-year term, a special or general
      election to fill such vacancy for the remainder of  the  unexpired  term
      shall be held.
        6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
      subdivision shall be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner:  A  special
      election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
      forty-five  days  after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the
      mayor,  in  the  proclamation  required  by  paragraph   one   of   this
      subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
      days  after  such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days after such
      proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
      to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
        (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
      the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
      vacancy is less than ninety days before a  regularly  scheduled  general
      election  or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall
      be filled at such general election;
        (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
      the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
      vacancy is after a regularly scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy
      shall be filled at such general election; and
        (c)  if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year
      and the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the  occurrence  of
      the  vacancy  is  after,  but  less  than thirty days after, a regularly
      scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be  filled  at  a  special
      election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
        7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
      paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
      nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
      made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
      of this subdivision shall not be counted.
        8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the council  at  an  election
      held  pursuant  to  paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office
      immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty-first  of
    
      the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled  for the remainder of the
      unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision.  A  person
      elected to fill a vacancy in the council at an election held pursuant to
      paragraph  five  of  this subdivision shall take office immediately upon
      qualification and serve until the term expires.
        9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
      primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
      general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
      office immediately upon qualification  and  fill  the  vacancy  for  the
      remainder of the unexpired term.
