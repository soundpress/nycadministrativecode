The deadline for filing such certification shall be:

      (i) for a primary and general election, (A) the ninth Monday preceding the primary election, or such other later date as the board shall provide, or (B) the thirtieth day after a special election is held to fill a vacancy for the office sought by the candidate; whichever is later; provided, however, that any candidate who files such written certification prior to such date shall be permitted to rescind such certification in writing on or before such date or prior to the receipt of public funds, whichever occurs first;

      (ii) for a special election to fill a vacancy, the fourteenth day after the proclamation of such special election.

      (iii) A certification may be filed on or before the seventh day after the occurrence of an extraordinary circumstance in an election, as declared by the campaign finance board, following the receipt and review of a petition submitted by a candidate in such election. For purposes of this paragraph, an "extraordinary circumstance" shall include the death of a candidate in the election, the resignation or removal of the person holding the office sought, and the submission to the board of a written declaration by an officeholder that terminates his or her campaign for reelection;

   (d) obtain and furnish to the campaign finance board, and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must obtain and furnish to the board, any information it may request relating to his or her campaign expenditures or contributions and furnish such documentation and other proof of compliance with this chapter as may be requested by such board, provided, however, that the board shall accept such required documentation through an electronically scanned transmission. For contributions submitted in support of a claim for matching funds, the following records shall be maintained by a candidate and his or her principal or authorized committee:

      (i) for a contribution by cash, a contribution card containing the contributor's name and residential address and the amount of the contribution;

The use of an entity other than the designated principal committee to aid or otherwise take part in the election(s) covered by the candidate's certification shall be a violation of this section and shall trigger the application to such entity of all provisions of this chapter governing principal committees;

   (f) not accept and his or her principal committee, or authorized committees must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions from any one individual, partnership, political committee, labor organization or other entity for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate which in the aggregate: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller shall exceed two thousand dollars, or (ii) for borough president, shall exceed one thousand five hundred dollars, or (iii) for member of the city council, shall exceed one thousand dollars; or a non-participating candidate which in the aggregate: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller shall exceed three thousand five hundred dollars, or (ii) for borough president, shall exceed two thousand five hundred dollars, or (iii) for member of the city council, shall exceed one thousand five hundred dollars; provided that a participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees may accept additional contributions which do not exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any run-off primary election, additional day for voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the New York state election law, special election to fill a vacancy, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, delayed or otherwise postponed election, or election held pursuant to court order which is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks nomination for election or election; and provided further that for the purposes of this paragraph, contributions made by different labor organizations shall not be aggregated or treated as contributions from a single contributor for purposes of the contribution limit that is set forth in this paragraph if those labor organizations make contributions from different accounts, maintain separate accounts with different signatories, do not share a majority of members of their governing boards, and do not share a majority of the officers of their governing boards; and provided further that if state law prescribes a contribution limitation of a lesser amount, this paragraph shall not be deemed to authorize acceptance of a contribution in excess of such lesser amount. The maximum contributions set forth in this paragraph shall be adjusted in accordance with subdivision seven of this section;

   (g) maintain and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must maintain such records of receipts and expenditures for a covered election as required by the board;

   (h) not make expenditures from or use his or her personal funds or property or the personal funds or property jointly held with his or her spouse, domestic partner, or unemancipated children in connection with his or her nomination for election or election except as a contribution to his or her principal committee in an amount that does not exceed three times the maximum contribution amount applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of this subdivision. Such candidate shall not make expenditures from or use other personal funds or property of his or her spouse, domestic partner or unemancipated children in connection with his or her nomination for election or election; provided that this paragraph shall not be construed to limit contributions by persons other than the candidate;

   (i) not make and his or her principal committee must not make expenditures which in the aggregate exceed the applicable expenditure limitations set forth in section 3-706;

   (j) meet the threshold for eligibility set forth in subdivision two of this section;

   (k) not accept and his or her principal committee must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any political committee for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating candidate, except as is otherwise provided for contributions by political committees pursuant to section 3-707 of this chapter; and

   (l) not accept and his or her principal committee or authorized committees must not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan from any corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or partnership, other than a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or partnership that is a political committee as defined in subdivision eleven of section 3-702 of this chapter, for all covered elections held in the same calendar year in which he or she is a participating or non-participating candidate, provided, however, that where a contribution is from a contributor whose name is followed by a professional designation including but not limited to "M.D.", "Esq." and "C.P.A." the board shall not treat such contribution as coming from a corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership or partnership in the absence of further indicia that such contribution is from such an entity;

   (m) fulfill the requirements of section 12-110 of the administrative code of the city of New York, including payment of any penalties as determined by the conflicts of interest board.

      (i) The conflicts of interest board shall maintain a record of all candidates in compliance with section 12-110 of the administrative code of the city of New York. Such record shall indicate the date of filing of the candidate's most recent annual disclosure report and the status of the candidate's compliance with section 12-110 of the administrative code for all years for which the candidate is required to file. Such record shall be provided to the campaign finance board upon request.

      (ii) A participating candidate shall fulfill the requirements of section 12-110 of the administrative code to the satisfaction of the conflicts of interest board by the twenty-fifth day after the last day for filing his or her designating or independent nominating petitions pursuant to the election law in the year of the covered election, or such other later date as the campaign finance board shall provide by rule, provided that in a special election to fill a vacancy such deadline shall be established by campaign finance board rule, and further provided that a participating candidate seeking public funds for a December 15, January 15, February 15, March 15, or April 15 payment date shall file a report or reports as required by subparagraph (a) of paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 12-110 and in order for such candidate to receive public funds on any such payment date the participating candidate shall fulfill the requirements of section 12-110 to the satisfaction of the conflicts of interest board by no less than three days prior to such payment date. A participating candidate that files a report covering the first nine months of the year preceding the year of the covered election shall not be eligible for further receipt of public funds after January 15 of the year of the covered election until a report covering the entire calendar year preceding the year of the covered election, as required by subparagraph (a) of paragraph 2 of subdivision b of section 12-110, has been made to the satisfaction of the conflicts of interest board and if such requirements are not satisfied then such participating candidate shall be liable for the repayment of any public funds received for such covered election.

      (iii) A participating candidate who fails to adhere to the requirements of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may thereafter satisfy the requirements of this paragraph by fulfilling the requirements of section 12-110 of the administrative code to the satisfaction of the conflicts of interest board. The campaign finance board shall thereafter allow the participating candidate to make a claim for public funds upon satisfying the requirements of this paragraph and all other applicable law, rules and regulations; provided, however that a failure to fulfill the requirements of section 12-110 of the administrative code to the satisfaction of the conflicts of interest board in a timely fashion pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may result in a delay of any payment of public funds by the board.

   (n) satisfy any claim made by the board for the payment of civil penalties or repayment of public funds that remains outstanding against such candidate or his or her principal committee or an authorized committee of such candidate from a prior covered election, if (i) the candidate had written notice of such potential claim and ineligibility to receive public funds prior to filing a written certification for the current covered election pursuant to paragraph (c) of this subdivision, or (ii) in the event no such timely notice has been given pursuant to subparagraph (i), the candidate has been given an opportunity to present to the board reasons he or she should be eligible to receive public funds.

   (o) agree that expenditures by his or her principal committee for the purpose of advocating a vote for or against a proposal on the ballot in an election that is also a covered election shall be subject to the contribution and expenditure limitations applicable in such covered election.

1-a. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, a participating candidate or his or her principal committee may not accept, either directly or by transfer, any contribution or contributions for a covered election in which he or she is a participating candidate from a natural person who has business dealings with the city, as that term is defined in subdivision eighteen of section 3-702 of this chapter, if the aggregate of such contributions to such candidate from such person for all covered elections in the same calendar year exceeds: (i) for the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller four hundred dollars; (ii) for borough president three hundred twenty dollars; and (iii) for member of the city council two hundred fifty dollars; provided that a participating candidate or his or her principal committee may accept additional contributions which do not exceed one half the amount of the applicable limitation for any run-off primary election, additional day for voting held pursuant to section 3-108 of the New York state election law, special election to fill a vacancy, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, delayed or otherwise postponed election, or election held pursuant to court order which is a covered election and in which the candidate seeks nomination for election or election. Any contribution made pursuant to this section shall not be a matchable contribution. For purposes of this subdivision, "person" shall include any chief executive officer, chief financial officer and/or chief operating officer of an entity which has business dealings with the city, any person employed in a senior managerial capacity regarding such an entity, or any person with an interest in such an entity which exceeds ten percent of the entity. For purposes of this subdivision, the phrase "senior managerial capacity" shall mean a high level supervisory capacity, either by virtue of title or duties, in which substantial discretion and oversight is exercised over the solicitation, letting or administration of business transactions with the city, including contracts, franchises, concessions, grants, economic development agreements and applications for land use approvals. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, the limitations on contributions contained herein shall not apply to any contribution made by a natural person who has business dealings with the city to a participating candidate or his or her principal committee where such participating candidate is the contributor, or where such participating candidate is the contributor's parent, spouse, domestic partner, sibling, child, grandchild, aunt, uncle, cousin, niece or nephew by blood or by marriage.

1-b. Individuals and organizations having business dealings with the city of New York.

   a. Each participating candidate and his or her principal committee shall provide to every individual or entity making a contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan in excess of the amounts set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 a notice containing the statement "If a contributor has business dealings with the City as defined in the campaign finance act, such contributor may contribute only up to two hundred fifty dollars for city council, three hundred twenty dollars for borough president and four hundred dollars for mayor, comptroller or public advocate." The principal committee shall report each contribution to the board on the next applicable filing deadline in accordance with the board's disclosure schedule. The board shall check each contribution against the doing business database and shall notify the principal committee within twenty days of the reporting of such contribution if a contribution exceeding the doing business contribution limitation set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 is subject to such limitations of this subchapter or if a contribution is not matchable pursuant to such subdivision. Notwithstanding any provision in this subdivision, in the six weeks preceding the covered election the board shall provide such notification to the principal or authorized committee within four business days of the reporting of such contribution to the board in accordance with applicable reporting deadlines. If the board fails to notify the principal committee that a contribution is in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 of this chapter in accordance with this subdivision, any such contribution shall be deemed valid for purposes of such limitation, provided, however, that no such contribution shall be matchable. Such principal committee shall have twenty days from the date of any such notification to return the amount of any contribution in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 to the contributor. No violation shall issue and no penalty shall be imposed where such excess amount is postmarked or delivered within twenty days of such notification by the board and the board shall not designate a candidate as having accepted a contribution in excess of such limitations where such excess has been returned in accordance with the time limitations set forth herein. Failure to return such excess amount in accordance with the provisions herein shall not result in the board withholding public funds for which the participating candidate's principal committee is otherwise eligible pursuant to section 3-705 of this chapter; provided, however, that the board may deduct an amount equal to the total unreturned contributions in excess of the limitations set forth in subdivision 1-a of section 3-703 of this chapter from such payment of public funds. For purposes of this section, "individual" shall include any chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and/or chief operating officer of an entity or persons serving in an equivalent capacity, any person in a senior managerial capacity regarding an entity, or any person with an interest in an entity, which exceeds ten percent of the entity. For purposes of this subdivision, the phrase "senior managerial capacity" shall mean a high level supervisory capacity, either by virtue of title or duties, in which substantial discretion and oversight is exercised over the solicitation, letting or administration of business transactions with the city, including contracts, franchises, concessions, grants, economic development agreements, and applications for land use approvals.

1-c. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section, a participating and non-participating candidate and his or her principal or authorized committee may accept text message contributions; provided, however, that such contributions may not exceed ninety nine dollars per contributor per candidate for all covered elections in the same calendar year, and further provided that the contributor shall certify via text message that he or she will personally pay the amount specified to the wireless service provider, and shall provide such other certifications as the board shall require. A text message contribution shall be attributed to the individual who is the registered user of the specific mobile device from which the contribution was initiated; shall be reported in accordance with the requirements of subdivision six of this section; and shall be a matchable contribution pursuant to subdivision three of section 3-702, provided such contribution meets the requirements of that subdivision, of this section, and of the rules of the board.

   2. (a) The threshold for eligibility for public funding for participating candidates in a primary or general election for mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president or member of the city council, or special election to fill a vacancy for borough president or member of the city council, shall be in the case of:

         (i)  mayor, not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums up to two hundred fifty dollars per contributor including at least one thousand matchable contributions of ten dollars or more;

         (ii)  public advocate and comptroller, not less than one hundred twenty-five thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to two hundred fifty dollars per contributor including at least five hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more;

      (iii) borough president, an amount equal to the number of persons living in such borough as determined by the last census multiplied by two cents in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one hundred seventy-five dollars per contributor including at least one hundred matchable contributions of ten dollars or more from residents of the borough, or ten thousand dollars comprised of sums of up to one hundred seventy-five dollars per contributor, whichever is greater.

      (iv) member of the city council, not less than five thousand dollars in matchable contributions comprised of sums of up to one hundred seventy-five dollars per contributor including at least seventy-five matchable contributions of ten dollars or more from residents of the district in which the seat is to be filled.

   (b) Any participating candidate meeting the threshold for eligibility in a primary election for one of the foregoing offices shall be deemed to have met the threshold for eligibility for such office in any other election, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, held in the same calendar year.

   (c) For any special election to fill a vacancy for mayor, public advocate or comptroller, the threshold dollar amount of summed matchable contributions pursuant to subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph (a) of this subdivision shall be halved.

3. In order to be eligible to receive public funds in a primary election a participating candidate must agree that in the event he or she is a candidate for such office in any other election held in the same calendar year, other than a special election to fill a vacancy, that he or she will be bound in each such other election by the eligibility requirements and all other provisions of this chapter.

4. Candidates who are contested in a primary election for nomination for election to office and who do not file a written certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section shall not be eligible for public funds for any election to such office held in the same calendar year other than a special election to fill a vacancy.

5. Participating candidates who are seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates, who are unopposed in a covered election, or who are opposed in a covered election only by candidates seeking nomination or election exclusively as write-in candidates, shall not be eligible to receive public funds for such election.

6. (a) Each participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee, and each non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees shall report to the board every contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan received by the candidate and such committee, the full name, residential address, occupation, employer, and business address of each contributor, lender, guarantor, or provider of security and of each person or entity which is the intermediary for such contribution, loan, guarantee, or other security for such loan, and every expenditure made by the candidate and such committee, including expenditures not subject to section 3-706. Disclosure reports shall be submitted at such times and in such form as the board shall require and shall be clearly legible.

   (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) above:

      (i) an intermediary need not be reported for any contribution to a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees that was collected from a contributor in connection with a party or other candidate-related event held at the residence of the person delivering the contribution, unless the expenses of such events at such residence for such candidate exceed five hundred dollars for a covered election or the aggregate contributions received from that contributor at such events exceed five hundred dollars;

      (ii) contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars from any one contributor for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election need not be separately itemized in disclosure reports submitted to the board on behalf of a participating, or limited participating or non-participating candidate and his or her principal committee or authorized committees, provided, however, that contributions which are not itemized shall not be matchable;

      (iii) the treasurer of the principal committee need not collect or disclose the occupation, employer, and business address of any contributor making contributions aggregating not more than ninety-nine dollars for all covered elections held in a single calendar year or for a special election; provided, however, such occupation, employer, and business address shall be disclosed if such contributors are employees of a participating or limited participating candidate or the spouse or domestic partner of such candidate or an entity in which such candidate, spouse or domestic partner has an ownership interest of ten percent or more or a management position, including, but not limited to, being an officer, director or trustee; and

      (iv) disclosure reports, other than reports required to be filed every six months in accordance with the schedule specified by the New York state board of elections, need not be submitted on behalf of a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees if the cumulative amount of contributions and loans accepted by such candidate and committee following the period covered in the last disclosure report submitted to the campaign finance board on behalf of such candidate is less than two thousand dollars or such higher amount as may be determined by the campaign finance board, provided, however, that disclosure reports shall be submitted on behalf of a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees if that candidate and his or her committee have made expenditures in excess of forty-five percent of the expenditure limitation applicable to participating and limited participating candidates under section 3-706. The campaign finance board shall make available to the public a copy of disclosure reports within two business days after they are accepted by the board.

6-a. Any rules promulgated by the board to require that disclosure reports submitted pursuant to this chapter be submitted in an electronic format shall provide exemptions for small campaigns, as defined by board rules, and for other campaigns that demonstrate that submission in an electronic format would pose a substantial hardship.

7. Not later than the first day of March in the year two thousand twenty-two and every fourth year thereafter the campaign finance board shall (i) determine the percentage difference between the average over a calendar year of the consumer price index for the metropolitan New York-New Jersey region published by the United States bureau of labor statistics for the twelve months preceding the beginning of such calendar year and the average over the calendar year two thousand nineteen of such consumer price index; (ii) adjust each maximum contribution applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision one of this section by the amount of such percentage difference to the nearest fifty dollars; and (iii) publish such adjusted maximum contribution in the City Record. Such adjusted maximum contribution shall be in effect for any election held before the next such adjustment.

8. If a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee or a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees demonstrate to the board that a political committee has not accepted contributions, loans, or other receipts or made expenditures or transfers in a covered election, and represent that such committee will not accept contributions, loans, or other receipts or make expenditures or transfers in a covered election, the participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee or non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees may submit to the board legible copies of financial disclosure reports, required to be filed with the city or state board of elections, for such committees in lieu of the disclosure report form designated by the board for purposes of subdivision six of this section.

9. No political committee authorized by a participating, or limited participating or non-participating candidate for a covered election may be authorized to aid or take part in the elections of more than one candidate.

10. All receipts accepted by a participating or limited participating candidate and his or her principal committee shall be deposited in an account of the principal committee. All receipts accepted by a non-participating candidate and his or her authorized committees shall be deposited in an account of the authorized committees. The treasurer of the principal committee or authorized committee shall be responsible for making such deposits. All deposits shall be made within twenty business days of receipt; provided, however, that deposits of contributions made in the form of cash shall be made within ten business days of receipt. Each disclosure report filed pursuant to subdivision six of this section shall include the date of receipt of each contribution accepted.

11. Regardless whether a participating candidate demonstrates eligibility for optional public financing under this chapter, a participating candidate and his or her principal committee are nonetheless required to abide by the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (k) and (l) of subdivision one of this section.

12. (a) Each participating candidate or limited participating candidate for nomination for election, or election, or the principal committee of such candidate, shall submit, in a contemporaneous manner, the disclosure reports required pursuant to this chapter, filed in accordance with the schedule specified by the state board of elections for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements, and such other disclosure reports as the rules of the board may require, in order for any contributions received during the periods covered by such reports and prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section to qualify as matchable contributions.

   (b) The board shall review each disclosure report timely submitted by a candidate prior to the last date upon which such candidate may file a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-717, and issue to the candidate a review within 30 days of the date upon which such disclosure report was due, provided a candidate may agree to an extension of time for such review by the board. Any response from the candidate to such review shall be due no earlier than when the next disclosure report is due. Such review shall inform the candidate of relevant questions the board has concerning the candidate's: (i) compliance with requirements of this chapter and of the rules issued by the board; and (ii) qualification for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter. In the course of this review, the board shall give candidates an opportunity to respond to and correct potential violations, before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section, or subdivision one of section 3-717, and give candidates an opportunity to address questions the board has concerning their matchable contribution claims or other issues concerning eligibility for receiving public funds pursuant to this chapter; provided, however, this paragraph shall not apply to the last required disclosure report before the deadline for filing a certification pursuant to paragraph (c) of subdivision one of this section or subdivision one of section 3-717. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the board from subsequently reviewing such disclosure reports and taking any action otherwise authorized under this chapter, provided that the board shall not invalidate a matchable contribution claim in a subsequent review unless the board learns of new information that is relevant to the eligibility for matching of such contribution claim and that was not available to the board at the time of the initial review.

13. Candidates who file a certification pursuant to subdivision one of this section shall not be eligible to file a certification pursuant to section 3-717, and candidates who file a certification pursuant to section 3-717 shall not be eligible to file a certification pursuant to subdivision one of this section.

14. (a) Transfers that a principal committee receives from a political committee (other than an authorized committee filing contemporaneous disclosure statements with the board in a timely manner) at any time during an election cycle shall:

      (i) be attributed to previous contributions in accordance with the duly promulgated rules of the campaign finance board applicable to such transfer or use;

      (ii) exclude an amount equal to the total of:

         (A) such previous contributions, or portions thereof, that violate the limitations, restrictions, or prohibitions of the charter and this chapter applicable in the covered election for which the principal committee is designated; and

         (B) such previous contributions, or portions thereof, for which the principal committee has not obtained and submitted to the board, prior to receipt of the transfer, evidence of the contributor's intent to designate the contribution for such covered election, and any other record, as determined by the rules of the board; and

Each participating candidate for nomination for election or election in a covered election may obtain payment to his or her principal committee from public funds for qualified campaign expenditures, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, and subject to appropriation.

1. No such public funds shall be paid to a principal committee unless the board determines that the participating candidate has met the eligibility requirements of this chapter. Payment shall not exceed the amounts specified in this chapter, and shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Such payment may be made only to the participating candidate's principal committee. No public funds shall be used except as reimbursement or payment for qualified campaign expenditures actually and lawfully incurred or to repay loans used to pay qualified campaign expenditures.

2. (a) If the threshold for eligibility is met, the participating candidate's principal committee shall receive payment for qualified campaign expenditures of: (i) eight dollars for each one dollar of matchable contributions, up to two thousand dollars in public funds per contributor, obtained and reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, with respect to any participating candidate for nomination for election or election to the office of mayor, public advocate or comptroller; or (ii) eight dollars for each one dollar of matchable contributions, up to one thousand four hundred dollars in public funds per contributor, obtained and reported to the campaign finance board in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, with respect to any participating candidate for nomination for election or election to the office of borough president or member of the city council.

   (b) In no case shall the principal committee of a participating candidate receive public funds pursuant to paragraph (a) above in excess of an amount equal to the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks nomination for election or election, less such expenditure limit divided by the addition of the number one and the dollar amount for each one dollar of matchable contributions for such office pursuant to paragraph a of this subdivision.

   (c) No funds shall be provided pursuant to this subdivision with respect to any covered election specified in subdivision five of this section.

3. A participating candidate seeking or obtaining nomination for election by more than one party shall be deemed one candidate, and shall not receive additional public funds or be authorized to accept contributions in excess of the maximum contribution applicable pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision one of section 3-703 or make additional expenditures by reason of such candidate seeking or obtaining nomination for election by more than one party. Subdivision five of section 3-703 shall not be applicable to such a candidate who is opposed for the nomination of at least one party in a primary election. The elimination of the expenditure limitations provided in subdivision three of section 3-706 shall not be applicable to such a candidate who is opposed for the nomination of at least one party solely by participating candidates.

4. For contributions reported less than ninety days before a covered general election, less than forty-five days before a covered primary election, or less than thirty days before any other covered election, the campaign finance board shall make possible payment within four business days after receipt of reports of matchable contributions, or as soon thereafter as is practicable; provided, however, that the board shall withhold up to five percent of all public funds payments to participating candidates until the final pre-election payment for any given election. The board shall schedule payment dates on December 15 of the year preceding the year of election, as well as January 15, February 15, March 15, April 15 and a minimum of three payment dates within the forty-five days prior to a covered primary election, a payment date of July 15 and a minimum of four payment dates within the ninety days prior to a covered general election, and a minimum of three payment dates within the thirty days prior to any other covered election.

For purposes of such payment dates, the board shall provide each candidate with a written determination specifying the basis for any non-payment. The board shall provide candidates with a process by which they may immediately upon receipt of such determination petition the board for reconsideration of any such non-payment and such reconsideration shall occur within five business days of the filing of such petition. In the event that the board denies such petition then it shall immediately notify the candidate of his or her right to bring a special proceeding pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and rules.

5. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a participating candidate in a run-off primary election held pursuant to section 6-162 of the New York state election law or a run-off special election to fill a vacancy shall obtain prompt payment for qualified campaign expenditures in an amount equal to twenty-five cents for each one dollar of public funds paid pursuant to this chapter to the candidate's principal committee for the preceding election.

   (c) Except as provided for by this subdivision and any rules promulgated hereby, no public funds shall be provided to any candidate for any run-off primary election, run-off special election to fill a vacancy, additional day for voting, election held pursuant to court order, or delayed or otherwise postponed election.

6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, to protect the public fund from disproportionately large payments when the number of voters eligible to vote in a primary election is small, the board shall adopt rules setting a reduced maximum primary election public funds payment for participating candidates on the ballot in one or more primary elections in which the number of persons eligible to vote for party nominees total fewer than such number as shall be specified by the board in such rules, if any. Any such rules shall not apply to participating candidates opposed in a primary election by one or more participating candidates who are not subject to such reduced maximum primary election public funds payment or by a non-participating candidate who makes expenditures in excess of a specified amount for such primary election, as determined by the board.

7. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the amount of public funds payable to a participating candidate on the ballot in any covered election shall not exceed one quarter of the maximum public funds payment otherwise applicable under subdivision two of this section, and no participating candidate shall be eligible to receive a disbursement of public funds prior to two weeks after the last day to file designating petitions for a primary election, unless:

      (1) the participating candidate has submitted a certified signed statement attesting to the need and stating the reason for additional public funds in such election, in which case the board shall publish such statement and supporting documentation at the time such additional public funds are paid, including on the board's internet website.

         (C) the participating candidate is opposed by a candidate who has had significant media exposure in the twelve months preceding the election. For purposes of this paragraph, significant media exposure shall mean appearance of the opponent or his or her name on television or radio in the area of the covered election or in print media in general circulation in the area of the covered election at least twelve times in the year preceding the covered election; provided, however, that the listing of names of candidates or potential candidates for a covered election without additional information concerning the opponent shall not constitute an appearance for purposes of this paragraph;

         (D) the participating candidate is opposed by a candidate who has received twenty-five percent or more of the vote in an election for public office in an area encompassing all or part of the area that is the subject of the current election in the last eight years preceding the election;

         (E) the participating candidate is opposed by a candidate whose name is substantially similar to the candidate's so as to result in confusion among voters, as determined by the board;

      (2) the participating candidate is opposed in a primary or special election for an office for which no incumbent is seeking re-election; or

      (3) the participating candidate is opposed by any candidate who has received public funds payments for the covered election.

8. Contributions by a principal committee of a participating candidate to other political committees shall not be a basis for reducing public funds payments, provided that:

   (a) such principal committee has received contributions (other than matchable contributions) that, in the aggregate, exceed the total of such contributions to other political committees and

   (b) such contributions in the aggregate do not exceed:

      (i) three thousand dollars, if such principal committee is the principal committee of a participating candidate seeking nomination for election or election to the office of member of the city council;

Such estimates shall be submitted in such manner and at such times as to assure that such amounts as shall be necessary may be appropriated in full by the beginning of the fiscal year prior to that in which elections are scheduled pursuant to the charter and that additional amounts may be appropriated as necessary.

4. The moneys in such fund shall be paid to participating candidates by the board upon its certification that such candidates qualify for such funds.

5. No moneys shall be paid to participating candidates in a primary or general election any earlier than December 15 of the year preceding the primary election, or the thirtieth day after a special election is held to fill a vacancy for the office sought by the candidate; whichever is later.

6. (a) No moneys shall be paid to participating candidates in a run-off primary election held pursuant to section 6-162 of the election law any earlier than the day after the day of the primary election held to nominate candidates for such election.

   (b) No moneys shall be paid to participating candidates in a run-off special election held to fill a vacancy any earlier than the day after the day of the special election for which such run-off special election is held.

7. No moneys shall be paid to any participating candidate who has been finally disqualified or whose designating or nominating petitions have been finally declared invalid by the New York city board of elections or a court of competent jurisdiction. Any payment from the fund in the possession of such a candidate or his or her principal committee on the date of such final disqualification or invalidation may not thereafter be expended for any purpose except the payment of liabilities incurred in qualified campaign expenditures before such date and shall be promptly repaid to the fund.

8. Prior to the first distribution of public funds to candidates in any election, the board shall make a determination whether the moneys in the fund are sufficient to provide all candidates the amounts they may receive pursuant to this chapter for all elections to be held during the calendar year for which such determination is made. Such determination shall be published in the City Record, together with information supporting such determination.

9. The board shall be empowered to accept donations to be credited to the fund. The board may devise such methods of soliciting and collecting donations as it may deem feasible and appropriate.








*§ 3-709.5 Mandatory debates.* ::


(1) (a) In any year in which a primary, general or special election is to be held, any participating candidate and any limited participating candidate for nomination or election to a city-wide office shall participate in either of the two pre-election debates, or both, held pursuant to this section for which he or she is eligible and is required to debate pursuant to this section. A participating candidate or limited participating candidate for nomination or election to a city-wide office is eligible to participate in a debate for each election in which he or she is on the ballot if he or she has met such criteria for participation as specified in this section, and as shall be further specified in any agreement between the debate sponsor and the board.

   (b) In any year in which a run-off primary or run-off special election to fill a vacancy for a city-wide office is held, any participating candidate and any limited participating candidate for nomination or election to such city-wide office who is on the ballot shall participate in one run-off election debate. If, seven days prior to the date of the run-off election debate, the New York city board of elections has not yet approved a finalized run-off ballot, the participating and limited participating candidates with the two highest vote counts in the primary or special election immediately preceding the run-off election, as determined by the New York city board of elections unofficial election results, shall participate in one run-off election debate. If any additional candidate is separated from the candidate with the second highest vote count by one percent or less of all votes cast in the special or primary election immediately preceding the run-off election, as determined by the New York city board of elections unofficial election results, then such candidate shall also participate in such run-off election debate. If the New York city board of elections determines prior to the run-off debate that a run-off election will not take place, the debate sponsors and the board shall cancel the run-off election debate.

   (c) In the case of a primary election, the debate shall be among participating candidates and limited participating candidates seeking the nomination of the same political party who meet the requirements provided in paragraph (a) of this subdivision. If there is no contested primary election for an office in a political party then no debate for that party's nomination shall be held pursuant to this section.

   (d) Each debate held pursuant to this section shall be at least one hour's duration.

2. For purposes of this section, a "debate" shall mean the moderated reciprocal discussion of issues among candidates on the ballot for the same office.

3. The campaign finance board shall select one or more sponsors for each debate required pursuant to this section. For primary, general and special elections, the second debate shall be a debate among the leading contenders for the office, as described in paragraph (b) of subdivision five of this section.

4. Organizations which are not affiliated with any political party or with any holder of or candidate for public office, which have not endorsed any candidate in the pending primary, special, general, or run-off election for the city-wide office shall be eligible to sponsor one or more of the required debates. The rules for conducting such debates, and the date, time and location of such debates, shall be solely the responsibility of the organizations selected but shall not be made final without consultation with the campaign finance board.

5. Written applications by organizations to sponsor a debate shall be submitted to the campaign finance board on a form provided by the board not later than a date chosen by the board in any year in which an election is held for city-wide offices.

   (a) The written application shall:

      (i) demonstrate that the organization and any proposed co-sponsor meet the criteria of subdivision four of this section;

      (ii) specify any elections and offices for which the organization seeks to sponsor debates;

      (iii) set forth proposed dates, times, durations, and locations of the debates and the specific and exclusive circumstances under which the dates or times may be changed, together with a provision for when the rescheduled debates would be held;

      (iv) provide a detailed description of the format and ground rules for the debates;

      (v) verify that the staging, promotion, and coverage of the debates shall be in conformance with all applicable laws;

      (vi) include an agreement to indemnify the city, including the board, for any liability arising from the acts or omissions of the sponsor;

      (vii) set forth plans for publicity and for broadcast and other media coverage for the debates; and

      (viii) set forth the proposed criteria for determining which candidates are eligible to participate in each debate the organization seeks to sponsor, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subdivision.

   (b) (i) Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) below, each debate for a primary, general or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates the sponsor of each such debate has determined meet the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board; provided, however, that the criteria for the first debate for a primary or general election shall include financial criteria requiring that a participating candidate or limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, (I) raised, and (II) spent, an amount equal to or more than two and one half percent of the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks nomination for election or election; provided, further, that the criteria for the first debate for a special election shall include financial criteria requiring that a participating candidate or limited participating candidate shall be eligible to participate in such debate if he or she has, by the last filing date prior to such debate, (I) raised, and (II) spent, an amount equal to or more than one and one quarter percent of the expenditure limitation provided in subdivision one of section 3-706 for the office for which such candidate seeks election; and provided, further, that the second debate for a primary, general, or special election shall include only those participating candidates or limited participating candidates who the sponsors have also determined are leading contenders on the basis of additional non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria set forth in any agreement between the sponsor and the board. For the purpose of determining whether a participating candidate or limited participating candidate has met the financial criteria to be eligible to participate in any debate, only contributions raised and spent in compliance with the act shall be used to determine the amount that the candidate has raised and spent as a percentage of the expenditure limit provided in subdivision one of section 3-706; further, money "raised" and "spent" does not include outstanding liabilities or loans. Nothing in this provision is intended to limit the debates to the two major political parties.

      (ii) If a debate sponsor has determined that a non-participating candidate has met all the non-partisan, objective, and non-discriminatory criteria applicable to participating candidates and limited participating candidates for access to any of the primary, general, or special election debates, the sponsor may invite that candidate to participate in such debate. In the case of a run-off primary election or a run-off special election, the sponsor may invite a non-participating candidate to participate in such debate. However, if a non-participating candidate does not accept such invitation to debate or does not appear at such debate, the debate shall go forward as scheduled; provided, however, if there is only one participating candidate or limited participating candidate participating in any such debate, such debate shall be canceled.

6. Prior to choosing a sponsor, the board shall provide for the receipt of comments from interested persons regarding the qualifications of potential sponsors. The board shall consider and give substantial weight to such comments submitted by candidates.

7. Based upon the criteria in subdivision four above and any comments received pursuant to subdivision six above, the board shall select the organization or organizations to sponsor the debates and shall provide written notification to the organization or organizations so selected. In addition to the sufficiency of the application, the board shall consider the applicant's ability to reach a wide audience and present a fair and impartial debate. The board may accept an application subject to modifications as it deems appropriate and as are acceptable to the sponsor.

8. For all debates, the board shall provide each debate sponsor it has selected with a list of participating candidates and limited participating candidates who are eligible to be considered to participate in such debates.

9. If a candidate fails to participate in any debate required under this section before an election, the candidate shall be liable for return of any public matching funds previously received pursuant to the certification filed by the candidate in connection with the election for which such debate is held, shall be ineligible to receive any further matching funds for that election, and may be subject to a civil penalty pursuant to section 3-711. For purposes of this subdivision, each primary, general, special or run-off election shall be considered a separate election.

10. Following the submission of a petition on behalf of the candidate and a hearing before the board, the sanction or sanctions provided in subdivision nine of this section applicable to a candidate for failure to participate in any debate as required under this section may be waived upon a determination by the board that the failure to participate in the debate occurred under circumstances beyond the control of the candidate and of such nature that a reasonable person would find the failure justifiable or excusable.

11. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude any candidate from agreeing to participate in any number of additional debates between any and all candidates for a city-wide office, including non-participating candidates or limited participating candidates. These debates need not be held under guidelines or the purview of the campaign finance board.

12. The city of New York shall indemnify each sponsor for any liability of such sponsor arising out of the acts or omissions of the city of New York in connection with the selection of candidates for participation in any debate held pursuant to this section 3-709.5.

13. Any broadcast plan accepted by the board pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 5, and subdivision 7, of this section shall include a requirement that the debate be made available, at no cost, to the city-owned or operated television channel serving the largest public audience for simultaneous broadcast. Each debate held pursuant to this section shall be broadcast simultaneously, to the extent technologically practicable and in accordance with federal law and the rules of the federal communications commission, on such city-owned or operated television channel. Such city-owned or operated television channel shall not be a sponsor of such debate.








*§ 3-710 Examinations and audits; repayments.* ::


1. The campaign finance board is hereby empowered to audit and examine all matters relating to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the proper administration of this chapter and of chapter 8 of title 3 of this code. The board shall conduct its campaign audits in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, and shall promulgate rules regarding what documentation is sufficient in demonstrating financial activity. These audit and examination powers extend to all participating candidates, limited participating candidates, and non-participating candidates, and the principal and authorized committees of all participating, limited participating, and non-participating candidates, provided that:

   a. Any draft audit, the subject of which is a participating, limited participating or non-participating candidate, or the principal and/or authorized committees of any participating, limited participating or non-participating candidate shall be completed within (i) eight months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) ten months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time;

   b. The campaign finance board shall provide each candidate a final audit, which shall contain the final resolution of all issues raised in the draft audit; such final audit shall be provided to the candidate, where such candidate or such candidate's campaign manager or treasurer has completed audit training provided by the board, within (i) fourteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election, for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) sixteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time. Where such candidate or such candidate's campaign manager or treasurer has not completed audit training provided by the campaign finance board, such final audit shall be provided to such candidate within (i) sixteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election, for city council races and borough-wide races, and (ii) eighteen months after the submission of the final disclosure report for the covered election for citywide races, unless the subject of such audit consents in writing to a longer period of time. Provided, however, that where the issuance of such final audit is preceded by a notice of violations and recommended penalties and/or a notice of repayment of public funds, such notice or notices shall include all potential penalties and/or repayment obligations and a notice of a candidate's right to a hearing pursuant to section 3-710.5 or section 3-710(4) of this chapter and shall be provided to the candidate according to the deadlines applicable to final audits as set forth in this paragraph.

   c. Any advice provided by board staff to a participating, limited participating, or non-participating candidate with regard to an action shall be presumptive evidence that such action, if taken in reliance on such advice, should not be subject to a penalty or repayment obligation where such candidate or such candidate's committee has confirmed such advice in a writing to such board staff by registered or certified mail to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile transmission with evidence of receipt, describing the action to be taken pursuant to the advice given and the board or its staff has not responded to such written confirmation within seven business days disavowing or altering such advice, provided that the board's response shall be by registered or certified mail to the correct address, or by electronic or facsimile transmission with evidence of receipt.

   d. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs a and b of this subdivision, if a committee has failed to respond to a request for information made by board auditors during the post-election audit process, the time period for completing the draft and final audits shall be tolled and extended by the number of days by which the committee has exceeded the original deadline for a response, provided that the committee has received timely written notice of: (i) the original deadline to provide the information, which shall not have been less than thirty days from the date such information was requested; and (ii) the commencement of the tolling period pursuant to this section. If a committee has responded to a request for information made by board auditors but such response is inadequate, the time period for completing the draft and final audits shall be tolled and extended by the number of days until an adequate response is provided, provided that the committee has received timely written notice of: (i) the original deadline to provide the information, which shall not have been less than thirty days from the date such information was requested; (ii) the commencement of the tolling period pursuant to this section; and (iii) the detailed reasons why the original response was inadequate.

   e. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, the deadlines provided in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision for the completion of draft and final audits shall not apply in cases where the audit raises issues involving potential campaign-related fraud, potential other criminal activity, or activity that may constitute a breach of certification pursuant to rules of the board or potential significant violations of the limits set forth in section 3-706.

   f. Notwithstanding any provision of the law to the contrary, the deadlines provided in paragraphs a and b of this subdivision for the completion of draft and final audits shall not apply in the event that board operations are interrupted due to a catastrophic emergency such as a natural disaster or criminal event, provided that once board operations resume, the board shall within two weeks announce new deadlines for the completion of draft and final audits consistent with paragraphs a and b.

2. (a) If the board determines that any portion of the payment made to the principal committee of a participating candidate from the fund was in excess of the aggregate amount of payments which such candidate was eligible to receive pursuant to this chapter, it shall notify such committee and such committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the amount of excess payments.

   (b) If the board determines that any portion of the payment made to a principal committee of a participating candidate from the fund was used for purposes other than qualified campaign expenditures, it shall notify such candidate and committee of the amount so disqualified and such candidate and committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to such disqualified amount; provided, however, that in considering whether or not a participating candidate shall be required to pay to the board such amount or an amount less than the entire disqualified amount, the board shall act in accordance with the following: (i) where credible documentation supporting each qualified campaign expenditure exists but is incomplete, the board shall not impose such liability for such expenditure; and (ii) where there is an absence of credible documentation for each qualified campaign expenditure, the board may impose liability upon a showing that such absence of credible documentation for such expenditure arose from a lack of adequate controls including, but not limited to trained staff, internal procedures to follow published board guidelines and procedures to follow standard financial controls.

   (c) If the total of contributions, other receipts, and payments from the fund received by a participating candidate and his or her principal committee exceed the total campaign expenditures of such candidate and committee for all covered elections held in the same calendar year or for a special election to fill a vacancy such candidate and committee shall use such excess funds to reimburse the fund for payments received by such committee from the fund during such calendar year or for such special election. No such excess funds shall be used for any other purpose, unless the total amount of the payments received from the fund by the principal committee has been repaid.

3. (a) If a participating candidate whose principal committee has received public funds is disqualified by a court of competent jurisdiction on the grounds that such candidate committed fraudulent acts in order to obtain a place on the ballot and such decision is not reversed, such candidate and his or her principal committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the total of public funds received by such principal committee.

   (b) If a participating candidate whose principal committee has received public funds fails to actively campaign for election to a covered office, such candidate and his or her principal committee shall pay to the board an amount equal to the total of public funds received by such principal committee. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term “actively campaign for a covered office” shall mean activities that include, but are not limited to, filing designating or nominating petitions for inclusion on the ballot, raising and spending funds for nomination for election or election to a covered office, seeking endorsements, and broadly soliciting votes.

   (c) If a participating candidate whose principal committee has received public funds prior to the last day for filing designating or nominating petitions for inclusion on the ballot ceases to actively campaign for a covered office, including but not limited to making public statements indicating that such participating candidate is no longer seeking nomination for election or election to a covered office, then the board shall inform such participating candidate of the board’s determination that such candidate has ceased actively campaigning for a covered office. Expenditures incurred prior to the date by which such candidate has ceased actively campaigning for a covered office may be considered qualified expenditures, but no expenditures incurred after the date of such a determination of the board shall be considered qualified expenditures.

4. No claim for the repayment of public funds shall be made against any candidate or committee without written notice to such candidate or committee, issued in a timely manner pursuant to all of the requirements of subdivision one of this section, and an opportunity to appear before the board. Any such repayment claim shall be based on a final determination issued by the board following an adjudication before the board consistent with the procedures set forth in section 1046 of the charter unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or principal committee. Such final determination shall be included in and made part of the final audit which shall be issued within thirty days of such determination.








*§ 3-710.5 Findings of violation infraction; adjudications; final determinations.* ::


(i) The board shall determine whether a participating candidate, his or her principal committee, principal committee treasurer or any other agent of a participating candidate has committed a violation or infraction of any provision of this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder, for which the board may assess a civil penalty pursuant to section 3-711 of this chapter. The board shall promulgate rules defining infractions, and such definitions shall include, but not be limited to, failures to comply with the provisions of this chapter or the rules promulgated hereunder that are limited and non-repetitive.

(ii) (a) The board shall give written notice and the opportunity to appear before the board to any participating, limited participating or non-participating candidate, his or her principal committee, authorized committee, committee treasurer or any other agent of such candidate, if the board has reason to believe that such has committed a violation or infraction before assessing any penalty for such action. Any such written notice of alleged violations shall be issued in a timely manner pursuant to all of the requirements of subdivision one of section 3-710 and shall precede the issuance of the final audit required pursuant to subdivision one of section 3-710. In the case of a written notice issued prior to the date of a covered election, or after the date of a covered election in the case of a notice regarding an alleged failure to respond to a request for audit documentation, such notice may be issued prior to the issuance of a draft audit. Alleged violations and proposed penalties shall be subject to resolution by adjudication before the board consistent with the procedures of section 1046 of the charter, unless such procedures are waived by the candidate or principal committee; provided, however, that in the case of adjudications conducted prior to the date of a covered election, the board shall use the procedures of section 1046 of the charter only to the extent practicable, given the expedited nature of such pre-election adjudications; and further provided that alleged violations and proposed penalties may be subject, at the discretion of the candidate or principal committee prior to the commencement of an adjudication proceeding before the board, to a proceeding before a tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings. Within 90 days of a candidate or principal committee's response to a notice of alleged violations and selection of adjudication process, the board shall accordingly calendar an adjudication proceeding before the board or serve a petition upon the candidate or principal committee for a proceeding before a tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings. No candidate, representative of a candidate or campaign finance board staff other than a professional counsel hired or retained for such purpose and not otherwise supervised by campaign finance board staff shall be present during an executive session of the board at which an adjudication before the board is discussed. The board shall issue a final determination within thirty days of the conclusion of an adjudication proceeding or, following a proceeding before a tribunal of the office of administrative trials and hearings and the receipt of findings and recommendations regarding such proceeding, each party shall have 20 days to submit written comments to the board and within 30 days of the conclusion of the written comments period the board shall issue a final determination.

   (b) The board shall include in every final determination:

      (i) notice of the respondent's right to bring a special proceeding challenging the board's final determination in New York State supreme court pursuant to article 78 of the civil practice law and rules; and

      (ii) notice of the commencement of the four-month period during which such a special proceeding may be brought pursuant to article 2 of the civil practice law and rules.

1. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict candidates or their agents from making appearances at events sponsored or paid for by persons, political committees, or other entities that are not in any way affiliated with such candidate or any agent of such candidate. The costs of such events shall not be considered contributions to or expenditures by such a candidate pursuant to this chapter solely because such an appearance is made; provided that this subdivision shall not apply to any event in relation to which contributions are solicited on behalf of such candidate.

2. The following activities in support of other candidates by a participating, or limited participating or non-participating candidate or his or her principal committee shall not be considered contributions to or expenditures by such participating, or limited participating or non-participating candidate or his or her principal committee, except to the extent such activities are paid for by such candidate or his or her principal committee for a covered election:

   (a) The act alone of endorsing or appearing with another candidate for public office, party nomination or party position.

3. The communication of an endorsement or appearance which is not insubstantial under paragraph (b) of subdivision two, fundraising assistance which is promotional under paragraph (c) of subdivision two and a political club communication which does not meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of subdivision two, shall be contributions to and expenditures by the participating, or limited participating or non-participating candidate.
