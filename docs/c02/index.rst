        §  24.  Election;  term;  vacancies.  a.  The public advocate shall be
      elected by the electors of the city at the same time and  for  the  same
      term  as in this charter prescribed for the mayor. A public advocate who
      resigns or is removed from office prior to the completion of a full term
      shall be deemed to have held that office for a full term for purposes of
      Section 1138 of the charter.
        b. The public advocate may be removed or suspended in the same  manner
      as provided in this charter with respect to the mayor.
        c.  Any  vacancy  in  the office of public advocate shall be filled by
      popular election in the following manner:
        1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the  office  of
      the  public advocate, the mayor shall proclaim the date for the election
      or elections required  by  this  subdivision,  provide  notice  of  such
      proclamation  to  the  city clerk and the board of elections and publish
      notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation  of  the  date
      for  an  election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this
      subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not  less  than
      twice  in  each  week  preceding the date of such election in newspapers
      distributed within the city, and  the  board  of  elections  shall  mail
      notice of such election to all registered voters within the city.
        2.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of the term, a
      general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the  unexpired
      term  shall  be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the
      vacancy occurs after the last day on which an occurring vacancy  may  be
      filled  at the general election in that same year with party nominations
      of candidates for such election being made at  a  primary  election,  as
      provided  in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs
      in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of
      the unexpired term  at  the  general  election  in  the  following  year
      provided,  however,  that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be
      held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph  nine
      of  this  subdivision.  Party  nominations  of  candidates for a general
      election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall
      be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph  five  of
      this subdivision.
        3.  If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim
      basis has not been previously held pursuant  to  paragraphs  four,  six,
      seven  and  eight  of  this  subdivision, the person elected to fill the
      vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at  a  general  election
      shall  take  office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until
      the term expires. If a special or general election to fill  the  vacancy
      on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
      the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general
      election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
      general election and shall serve until the term expires.
        4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on
      or  before  the  last  day  in  the  third  year of the term on which an
      occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
      at  a  general  election  with  party nominations of candidates for such
      election being made at a primary election, as provided in section  6-116
      of  the  election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy
      on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs  less  than
      ninety  days before the next primary election at which party nominations
      for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or  before
      the  last  day  on  which  an  occurring  vacancy  may be filled for the
      remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year
      in which the vacancy occurs with party  nominations  of  candidates  for
    
      such  election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section
      6-116 of the election law.
        5.  If  a  vacancy  occurs after the last day in the third year of the
      term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for  the  remainder  of
      the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  in  such year with party
      nominations of candidates for such election  being  made  at  a  primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less
      than  ninety  days before the date of the primary election in the fourth
      year of such term, a special or general election to  fill  such  vacancy
      for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held.
        6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
      subdivision shall be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner:  A  special
      election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
      forty-five  days  after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the
      mayor,  in  the  proclamation  required  by  paragraph   one   of   this
      subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
      days  after  such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days after such
      proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
      to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
        (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
      the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
      vacancy is less than ninety days before a  regularly  scheduled  general
      election  or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall
      be filled at such general election;
        (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
      the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
      vacancy is after a regularly scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy
      shall be filled at such general election; and
        (c)  if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year
      and the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the  occurrence  of
      the  vacancy  is  after,  but  less  than thirty days after, a regularly
      scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be  filled  at  a  special
      election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
        7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
      paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
      nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
      made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
      of this subdivision shall not be counted.
        8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of public advocate
      at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall
      take office immediately upon  qualification  and  serve  until  December
      thirty-first  of  the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled for the
      remainder of the unexpired  term  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this
      subdivision.  A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of public
      advocate at  an  election  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  five  of  this
      subdivision  shall  take office immediately upon qualification and serve
      until the term expires.
        9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
      primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
      general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
      office immediately upon qualification  and  fill  the  vacancy  for  the
      remainder of the unexpired term.
        d.  The  public  advocate  may,  by  written  authority filed with the
      appropriate board, body or committee and with the city clerk,  designate
      any  two  officers  or  employees  appointed  by  the public advocate to
      exercise the powers specified in this subdivision. Either  such  officer
      or  employee, so designated, may act in the place of the public advocate
      on any board, body or committee, other than the council,  of  which  the
    
      public advocate is a member whenever the public advocate shall be absent
      from a meeting of said board, body or committee for any reason whatever.
        e.  The  public  advocate  shall  have the right to participate in the
      discussion of the council but shall not have a vote.
        f. In addition  to  other  duties  and  responsibilities,  the  public
      advocate  shall  serve  as the public advocate and shall (1) monitor the
      operation of the public information and service  complaint  programs  of
      city  agencies  and  make proposals to improve such programs; (2) review
      complaints of a recurring and multiborough or city-wide nature  relating
      to  services  and  programs,  and  make  proposals to improve the city's
      response  to  such  complaints;  (3)   receive   individual   complaints
      concerning  city  services  and  other  administrative  actions  of city
      agencies; and (4) investigate and  otherwise  attempt  to  resolve  such
      individual  complaints except for those which (i) another city agency is
      required by law to adjudicate, (ii) may be resolved through a  grievance
      mechanism established by collective bargaining agreement or contract, or
      (iii) involve allegations of conduct which may constitute a violation of
      criminal  law or a conflict of interest. If the public advocate receives
      a complaint which is subject to a procedure described in  items  (i)  or
      (ii) of this paragraph, the public advocate shall advise the complainant
      of  the  appropriate  procedure for the resolution of such complaint. If
      the public advocate receives a complaint of the type described  in  item
      (iii)  of  this  paragraph, the public advocate shall promptly refer the
      matter in accordance with subdivision k of this section.
        g. The public advocate shall establish procedures  for  receiving  and
      processing    complaints,   responding   to   complainants,   conducting
      investigations, and reporting findings,  and  shall  inform  the  public
      about  such  procedures.  Upon an initial determination that a complaint
      may be valid, the public advocate shall  refer  it  to  the  appropriate
      agency.  If  such  agency  does  not  resolve  the  complaint  within  a
      reasonable time, the public advocate may conduct  an  investigation  and
      make  specific  recommendations  to  the  agency  for  resolution of the
      complaint. If, within a reasonable time after the  public  advocate  has
      completed  an  investigation and submitted recommendations to an agency,
      such agency has failed to  respond  in  a  satisfactory  manner  to  the
      recommendations,  the  public advocate may issue a report to the council
      and the mayor.  Such  report  shall  describe  the  conclusions  of  the
      investigation   and   make   such  recommendations  for  administrative,
      legislative,  or  budgetary   action,   together   with   their   fiscal
      implications,  as  the  public  advocate  deems necessary to resolve the
      individual complaint or complaints or to address the underlying problems
      discovered in the investigation.
        h. In addition  to  other  duties  and  responsibilities,  the  public
      advocate  may  review  the programs of city agencies. Such reviews shall
      include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  annual  evaluations  of:  (1)  the
      implementation  of  the requirements for coterminality of local services
      contained in all subdivisions of section twenty seven hundred four;  (2)
      the  effectiveness  of  the  public  information  and  service complaint
      programs of city agencies; and (3) the responsiveness of  city  agencies
      to  individual  and group requests for data or information regarding the
      agencies' structure, activities  and  operations.  The  public  advocate
      shall  submit any reports documenting or summarizing such reviews to the
      council, mayor and appropriate agency and shall include in such  reports
      his  or  her  recommendations for addressing the problems identified and
      the fiscal implications of such recommendations.
        i. Except for those matters which involve conduct which may constitute
      a violation of criminal law  or  a  conflict  of  interest,  the  public
      advocate  may,  on the request of a resident, taxpayer, community board,
    
      council member or borough president,  or  on  his  or  her  own  motion,
      inquire  into  any alleged failure of a city officer or agency to comply
      with any provision of the charter. If as a result of such  inquiry,  the
      public  advocate  concludes  that  there  is  any substantial failure to
      comply with any provision of the charter,  he  or  she  shall  submit  a
      preliminary  report  documenting  the  conclusions of the inquiry to the
      officer or officers and the head  of  each  agency  involved.  Within  a
      reasonable  time  after  submitting  such preliminary report, the public
      advocate shall issue a final report to the council,  mayor,  and  agency
      documenting the conclusions of the inquiry.
        j.  The  public advocate shall have timely access to those records and
      documents of city agencies which the public advocate deems necessary  to
      complete  the  investigations,  inquiries  and  reviews required by this
      section. If a city agency does not comply  with  the  public  advocate's
      request  for such records and documents, the public advocate may request
      an appropriate committee of the council to  require  the  production  of
      such  records  and  documents  pursuant  to  section  twenty-nine of the
      charter. The provisions of this subdivision shall  not  apply  to  those
      records  and  documents  of city agencies for which a claim of privilege
      may properly be raised or  which  are  prepared  or  maintained  by  the
      department  of  investigation for use in any investigation authorized by
      chapter thirty-four of the charter.
        k. If the public advocate receives a complaint alleging conduct  which
      may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest, he
      or  she shall promptly refer the complaint regarding criminal conduct to
      the department of investigation or, as applicable,  to  the  appropriate
      prosecuting attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall refer the
      complaint  regarding  conflict  of interest to the conflicts of interest
      board. If during the conduct of any investigation,  inquiry,  or  review
      authorized  by  this  section,  the  public  advocate discovers that the
      matter involves conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law
      or a conflict of interest, he or she shall take no  further  action  but
      shall  promptly  refer  the  matter  regarding  criminal  conduct to the
      department of  investigation  or,  as  applicable,  to  the  appropriate
      prosecuting  attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall promptly
      refer the matter regarding conflict of  interest  to  the  conflicts  of
      interest  board.  Unless  otherwise  provided  by  law,  all  complaints
      received and any investigative file prepared or maintained by the public
      advocate  regarding  matters  covered  by  this  subdivision,  shall  be
      confidential.
        l. Before making public any portion of any draft, preliminary or final
      report  relating  to  the  operations or activities of a city officer or
      agency, the public advocate shall send a copy of the draft report to any
      such officer, and to the head of any agency, discussed  in  such  report
      and  provide  the  officer  and  agency,  in  writing, with a reasonable
      deadline for their  review  and  response.  The  public  advocate  shall
      include  in  any report, or portion thereof, which is made public a copy
      of all such officer and agency responses.
        m. The public advocate may hold  public  hearings  in  the  course  of
      fulfilling  the  requirements  of  this section provided that a complete
      transcript of any such hearings  shall  be  made  available  for  public
      inspection  free  of  charge  within  sixty  days after the hearing. The
      public advocate shall also provide a copy of any requested pages of such
      transcript at a reasonable  fee  to  cover  copying  and,  if  relevant,
      mailing costs.
        n.  Not  later  than the thirty-first day of October of each year, the
      public advocate shall present to the council a report on the  activities
      of  the  office  during  the  preceding  fiscal  year.  The report shall
    
      include: (1) a statistical summary of  the  complaints  received  during
      such  fiscal  year,  categorized  by  agency,  type of complaint, agency
      response, mode of resolution, and  such  other  factors  as  the  public
      advocate  deems appropriate; (2) an analysis of recurring complaints and
      the public advocate's recommendations for administrative, legislative or
      budgetary  actions  to  resolve  the  underlying  problems  causing  the
      complaints;  (3)  a  summary  of the findings and recommendations of the
      agency program reviews conducted during the fiscal year and a summary of
      the agency responses to such findings and recommendations; (4) a summary
      of the charter requirements which, in the opinion of the public advocate
      are not being implemented by the city agencies and officers  subject  to
      them, including a description of the nature and extent of the failure to
      comply and a summary of the responses of the agencies or officers to the
      public  advocate's  conclusions;  and  (5)  a summary of improvements in
      charter compliance since the public advocate's last annual  report.  The
      public  advocate  shall include an assessment of the fiscal implications
      of any recommendations presented in this report.

Section 25. ::    
        
     
        §  25.  Election;  term;  vacancies.  a.  The council members shall be
      elected  at  the  general  election  in  the   year   nineteen   hundred
      seventy-seven and every fourth year thereafter and the term of office of
      each council member shall commence on the first day of January after the
      elections  and  shall  continue  for  four  years  thereafter; provided,
      however, that the council member elected at the general election in  the
      year two thousand and one and at the general election in every twentieth
      year  thereafter  shall  serve for a term of two years commencing on the
      first day of January after such election; and provided further  that  an
      additional  election  of  Council  Members  shall be held at the general
      election in the year two thousand three  and  at  the  general  election
      every  twentieth  year  thereafter  and that the members elected at each
      such additional election shall serve for a term of two  years  beginning
      on the first day of January after such election.
        Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this charter or other law, a
      full term of two years, as established by  this  subsection,  shall  not
      constitute  a  full term under section 1138 of this charter, except that
      two consecutive full terms of two years shall constitute one  full  term
      under  section  1138.  A member of the council who resigns or is removed
      from office prior to the completion of a full term shall  be  deemed  to
      have  held  that  office for a full term for purposes of section 1138 of
      the charter.
        b. Any vacancy which may occur among  the  council  members  shall  be
      filled by popular election in the following manner.
        1.  Within  three  days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the council,
      the mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required
      by this subdivision, provide notice of such  proclamation  to  the  city
      clerk  and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City
      Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election  to  be  held
      pursuant  to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk
      shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week  preceding
      the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and
      the  board  of  elections  shall  mail  notice  of  such election to all
      registered voters within the district in which the  election  is  to  be
      held.
        2.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
      term or the first year of a two-year term, a general  election  to  fill
      the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the
      year  in  which  the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the
      last day on which an occurring vacancy may  be  filled  at  the  general
      election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such
      election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116
      of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in  any  year  after  such
      last  day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at
      the general election in the following year provided,  however,  that  no
      general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the
      term,  except  as  provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party
      nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a  vacancy  for
      the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election,
      except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision.
        3.  If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim
      basis has not been previously held pursuant  to  paragraphs  four,  six,
      seven  and  eight  of  this  subdivision, the person elected to fill the
      vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at  a  general  election
      shall  take  office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until
      the term expires. If a special or general election to fill  the  vacancy
      on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
      the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general
    
      election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
      general election and shall serve until the term expires.
        4.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
      term or in the first year of a two-year term and on or before  the  last
      day in the third year of such a four-year term or the first year of such
      a  two-year  term  on  which  an occurring vacancy may be filled for the
      remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  with  party
      nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, a special or
      general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be  held,
      unless  the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary
      election at which party nominations for a general election to  fill  the
      vacancy  may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring
      vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  the
      general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party
      nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law.
        5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day  in  the  third  year  of  a
      four-year  term  or  the  first  year  of  a  two-year  term on which an
      occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
      at  a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates

      adopted by any of the following methods:
        1.  By local law adopted in accordance with  the  provisions  of  this
      charter.
        2.   By vote of the electors of the city upon the petition of electors
      of the city, an amendment may be adopted
        (a)  in relation to the manner of voting for the elective officers  of
      the city or any of them, or
        (b)    abolishing  any  elective  office  or offices or creating a new
      office or offices, including if so provided a transfer of powers to  the
      newly  created  office  or offices or a disposition of the powers of any
      office abolished, but no such  amendment  shall  repeal  or  change  any
      limitations contained in this charter on any power.
        (c)  such amendment may be adopted in the manner following:
        (1)  Not  less  than fifty thousand qualified electors of the city may
      file in the office of the city clerk a petition for  the  submission  to
      the  electors  of the city at the next general election therein held not
      less than sixty days after filing of such petition of  such  a  proposed
      amendment  or  amendments  to the charter to be set forth in full in the
      petition.   The petition may  be  made  upon  separate  sheets  and  the
      signatures  of each shall be authenticated in the manner provided by the
      Election Law for the  authentication  of  designating  petitions.    The
      several  sheets  so  signed and authenticated when fastened together and
      offered for filing shall be  deemed  to  constitute  one  petition.    A
      signature made earlier than one hundred twenty days before the filing of
      the  petition shall not be counted.  If within ten days after the filing
      of such petition a written objection thereto be filed with the office of
      the city clerk, the Supreme Court or any justice thereof of  the  first,
      second  or  eleventh  judicial  district  shall  determine  any question
      arising thereunder and make such order as justice  may  require.    Such
      proceedings  shall  be  heard and determined in the manner prescribed by
      the election law in relation to judicial proceedings thereunder.
        (2)  If such proposed amendment or amendments receive the  affirmative
      vote  of  the  majority  of  the  qualified  electors of the city voting
      thereon, it or they shall take effect as prescribed therein.
        3.  In such other manner as may be provided by law.

      approval  of  the  electors  pursuant  to this charter shall contain the
      title of such local law or a brief statement  of  the  subject  of  such
      amendment.  The  city  clerk  with the advice of the corporation counsel

      the electors at the time of  the  registration  of  voters  and  at  the
      election.    If there be more than one such proposition to be voted upon
      at  such  election,  each  such   proposition   shall   be   separately,
      consecutively  and  consistently  numbered  on  the  ballot  and  on the
      abstract. In case of a conflict between two local laws or two amendments
      adopted at the same election, the one receiving the largest  affirmative

      clerk  may  be removed on charges by a two-third vote of all the council
      members, subject, however, to judicial  review.  The  city  clerk  shall
      collect such fees as shall be fixed by law.

      clerk, the city clerk by an instrument in writing may designate  one  of
      his  or  her  clerks,  who shall be vested with and possessed of all the
      rights and powers and charged with all the duties by  law  imposed  upon
      said  clerk. The signature of the person so designated shall be in place
      of and of the same force and effect as the signature of the city  clerk.

      remain  of  record  in the city clerk's office and in the offices of the
      mayor and of the comptroller, but the designation shall be for a  period
      not  exceeding three months and shall not extend beyond the city clerk's
      term of office and shall be at all times revocable by the city clerk.
