      shall be one hundred sixty-five thousand dollars a year.
        b. The salary of each council  member  shall  be  one  hundred  twelve
      thousand  five  hundred  dollars a year. In addition any council member,
      while serving as  a  committee  chairperson  or  other  officer  of  the

      fixed by resolution, after a hearing, for the particular and  additional
      services pertaining to the additional duties of such position.
        c.   If  prior  to  the  enactment  of  a  local  law  increasing  the
      compensation of council members, the council establishes a commission to
      study and make recommendations for changes in the compensation levels of
      council  members,  or  if  it  otherwise  causes  an  analysis  of  such
      compensation  levels  to  be made to assist it in its consideration of a
      local law, such study  or  analysis  may  include  an  analysis  of  the
      benefits,  detriments,  costs  and  impacts  of  placing restrictions on
      earned income derived by council members from sources other  than  their
      council salary.
