Section 37. ::    
        
     
        §  37.  Local laws; action by mayor.  a.  Every local law certified by
      the clerk of the council, after its passage by  the  council,  shall  be
      presented to the mayor for approval.
        b.    If the mayor approves the local law, the mayor shall sign it and
      return it to the clerk; it shall then be deemed to  have  been  adopted.
      If the mayor disapproves it, he or she shall return it to the clerk with
      his  or her objections stated in writing and the clerk shall present the
      same with such objections to the council at its next regular meeting and
      such objections shall be entered in its journal.    The  council  within
      thirty  days  thereafter  may  reconsider  the  same.    If  after  such
      reconsideration the votes of two-thirds of all the  council  members  be
      cast  in  favor of repassing such local law, it shall be deemed adopted,
      notwithstanding the objections of the mayor.  Only one vote shall be had
      upon such reconsideration.  The vote shall be taken by  ayes  and  noes,
      which  shall be entered in the journal.  If within thirty days after the
      local law shall have been presented to  him  or  her,  the  mayor  shall
      neither  approve  nor  return the local law to the clerk with his or her
      objections, it shall be deemed to have been adopted in like manner as if
      the mayor had signed it.  At any time prior to the return of a local law
      by the mayor, the council may recall the same and reconsider its  action
      thereon.
