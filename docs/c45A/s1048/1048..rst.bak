Section 1048. ::    
        
     
        §  1048.  Office. 1. There shall be an office of administrative trials
      and hearings which shall conduct adjudicatory hearings for all  agencies
      of  the city unless otherwise provided for by executive order, rule, law
      or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.  The  office  shall  be
      directed by the chief administrative law judge, who shall be an attorney
      admitted  to  practice for at least five years in the state of New York.
      The chief administrative law judge shall be appointed by the mayor.
        2. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of  law  and  except  as
      provided  in  subdivision  five  of  this  section,  the  mayor shall be
      authorized to designate by executive order the office of  administrative
      trials and hearings as the tribunal for the impartial administration and
      conduct  of  adjudicatory  hearings  for violations of this charter, the
      administrative code of the city of New York, rules promulgated  pursuant
      to  this  charter or such code and any other laws, rules, regulations or
      other policies enforced or implemented  by  the  agencies  of  the  city
      through  the  conduct  of adjudications. Pursuant to any such order, the
      mayor may transfer entire tribunals or parts thereof, or  categories  of
      adjudications  to  such office, which may perform such responsibilities,
      including responsibilities delegated elsewhere by this charter or  other
      law, as the mayor shall direct in such order. In furtherance of any such
      order,  agencies  shall  be  authorized to establish their tribunals, or
      parts thereof, within such office. No existing right or  remedy  of  any
      character shall be lost, impaired or affected by reason of a transfer of
      a tribunal or part thereof or category of adjudications pursuant to this
      subdivision except as may be necessary to implement such transfer.
        3.  Any  order issued by the mayor pursuant to subdivision two of this
      section may include provision for matters pending at the time  that  any
      transfer  pursuant  to  such  subdivision  shall  take effect and may in
      appropriate instances deem agency rules in effect on  the  date  of  any
      transfer  to  be  rules  of  the  office  of  administrative  trials and
      hearings. Any such order may in addition address circumstances in  which
      agencies shall continue to make final findings of fact and/or decisions,
      determinations or orders.
        4.  (a)  The  mayor  shall  constitute  a  committee  to  evaluate the
      adjudicatory  functions  carried  out  by  city  agencies  and  to  make
      recommendations  with respect to the transfers authorized by subdivision
      two of this section. Such committee shall be chaired by the deputy mayor
      for legal affairs or another  designee  of  the  mayor.  It  shall  have
      representatives  from  the office of administrative trials and hearings,
      the law department, the department of citywide  administrative  services
      and  any  other  agency  the  mayor  deems  necessary  to  implement the
      transfers described in this section. The work of such committee shall be
      deemed  complete  upon  submission  to  the  mayor  of  a  final  report
      identifying   the   tribunals   or   parts  thereof,  or  categories  of
      adjudications, that have been consolidated or that should be  considered
      for  future  consolidation, provided that the mayor may reconstitute the
      committee at any  time  to  perform  the  functions  described  in  this
      section.
        (b) Before recommending transfers of tribunals or parts thereof, or of
      categories  of  adjudications, the committee shall solicit comments from
      the public, including, to the extent practicable, any  segments  of  the
      public  particularly  affected by such transfers. In furtherance of such
      solicitation, the committee or a person  or  agency  designated  by  the
      committee shall hold a public hearing, on notice of at least twenty days
      published  in  the  City Record. Such notice shall specify the transfers
      that are under consideration by the committee for recommendation to  the
      mayor.
    
        (c)  The  authority  conferred  upon the mayor by subdivisions two and
      three of this section shall not be limited by  or  contingent  upon  the
      requirements of this subdivision.
        5.  Subdivisions  two  through four of this section shall not apply to
      the office of administrative tax appeals, including the  tax  commission
      and the tax appeals tribunal, or the board of standards and appeals.
