      program established by this chapter. Two members shall be  appointed  by
      the mayor, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled
      in  any  one  political  party;  two  members  shall be appointed by the
      speaker of the city council, provided that not more than one such member

      appointed  by  the  comptroller;  one  member  shall be appointed by the
      borough presidents acting together; and one member shall be appointed by

      her absence, a representative, and the executive director of  the  board
      of  elections  (or, in his or her absence, the deputy executive director

      mayor,  speaker,  comptroller  and  borough  presidents  shall  consider
      experience  with  groups   or   categories   of   residents   that   are

        1. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
        2. one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
        3. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;
        4. one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years;

      Thereafter,  each  member  shall  be  appointed for a term of five years
      according to the original manner of appointment. Upon expiration of  the
      term  of a member, if the appointing official or officials shall fail to
      appoint a member within one hundred twenty days  of  the  expiration  of
      such  term,  the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed
      for an additional term of five years. In case of a vacancy in the office
      of an appointed member, a member shall be appointed  to  serve  for  the
      remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  according to the original manner of
      appointment. For appointees of the mayor or speaker, such  member  shall
      not  be  enrolled  in  the  same  political  party  as  the other member
      appointed by the official making the appointment to  fill  the  vacancy.
