Section 1052. ::    
        
     
        §  1052.  Campaign  finance  board.  a.   1. There shall be a campaign
      finance board consisting of five members.   Two  members  of  the  board
      shall  be  appointed  by the mayor, provided that not more than one such
      member shall be enrolled in any one political  party,  and  two  members
      shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that not more
      than  one  such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and
      one member, who shall be the chairperson,  shall  be  appointed  by  the
      mayor  after  consultation  with the speaker. The members shall first be
      appointed to serve as follows:
        (a) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
        (b) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
        (c) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;
        (d) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years; and
        (e) the chairperson for a term of five years.
        The first  term  shall  commence  on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight.  Thereafter,  each member shall be appointed, by the mayor
      or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment,  for  a
      term  of five years that shall, for any term beginning on or after March
      first two thousand eleven, commence on December first. Terms that  began
      before,  and have not expired on, March first, two thousand eleven shall
      be extended and shall expire on the November thirtieth  following  their
      original  March  thirty-first  expiration  dates. Upon expiration of the
      term of a member, if the mayor or the  speaker,  as  appropriate,  shall
      fail  to  appoint  a  member  within  one  hundred  twenty  days  of the
      expiration of such term, the member whose  term  has  expired  shall  be
      deemed  appointed  for  an  additional  term  of  five  years, provided,
      however, that if the expiration of such term occurs in a year  in  which
      elections,  except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of
      campaign finance reform are scheduled, the member whose term has expired
      shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five  years  if  the
      mayor  or  the  speaker,  as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member
      within ninety days of the expiration of such term. In case of a  vacancy
      in  the  office  of  a  member, a member shall be appointed to serve the
      remainder of the unexpired term by the mayor or the  speaker,  according
      to  the  original manner of appointment. If the mayor or the speaker, as
      appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within  one  hundred  eighty
      days  of  such vacancy, then a member shall be appointed by the board to
      serve for the remainder  of  the  unexpired  term,  if  additional  time
      remains  in such term, provided, however, that if such vacancy occurs in
      a year, or within ninety days prior  to  a  year,  in  which  elections,
      except  special  elections,  covered by the voluntary system of campaign
      finance reform are scheduled, then a member shall be  appointed  by  the
      board  to  serve  for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional
      time remains in such term, if the mayor or the speaker, as  appropriate,
      shall  fail  to  appoint  a  member  within ninety days of such vacancy.
      Except for the chairperson, such member shall not  be  enrolled  in  the
      same  political  party as the other member appointed by the official who
      failed to so appoint. Each member shall  be  a  resident  of  the  city,
      registered  to  vote  therein.  Each  member  shall  agree  not  to make
      contributions to any candidate for nomination for election, or election,
      to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president,
      or member of the council which in the aggregate are  in  excess  of  the
      maximum contribution applicable to such office pursuant to any local law
      establishing  a  voluntary  system of campaign finance reform. No member
      shall serve as an officer of a political party, or be  a  candidate,  or
      participate in any capacity in a campaign by a candidate, for nomination
      for  election  or  election  to  the  office  of mayor, public advocate,
      comptroller, borough president or member of the city  council.  Officers
    
      and employees of the city or any city agency, lobbyists required to file
      a  statement  of  registration under section 3-213 of the administrative
      code and the employees of such lobbyists shall not  be  eligible  to  be
      members  of the board. In appointing members to the board, the mayor and
      the  speaker  shall  consider  campaign  experience   in   general   and
      particularly campaign experience with the New York city campaign finance
      system.  Members  of  the  board  shall  be required to undergo training
      developed pursuant to paragraph 14 of this section.
        2. The members of the board shall be compensated at the  rate  of  one
      hundred dollars per calendar day when performing the work of the board.
        3.  The  board  may  employ  necessary  staff,  including an executive
      director and a counsel,  and  make  necessary  expenditures  subject  to
      appropriation.
        4.  No  member  of  the  campaign  finance board shall be removed from
      office except for cause and upon notice and hearing.
        5. The board shall have the power to investigate all matters  relating
      to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the
      proper administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
      established  by  local law and for such purposes shall have the power to
      require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath  of
      such persons as it shall deem necessary and to require the production of
      books,   accounts,   papers   and   other   evidence  relative  to  such
      investigation.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision   of   law,   the
      investigative  and adjudicatory powers and functions of the staff to the
      board shall be separate and no staff member of the board  shall  perform
      both investigative and adjudicatory tasks or functions.
        6.  The  board  shall publicize, as it deems appropriate, the names of
      candidates for nomination or election to the  office  of  mayor,  public
      advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president, or city council who violate
      any of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
      established by local law.
        7. The board may render advisory opinions with  respect  to  questions
      arising  under any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign
      finance reform. Such advisory opinions may be rendered  on  the  written
      request of a candidate, an officer of a political committee or member of
      the  public,  or  may be rendered on its own initiative. The board shall
      make public its advisory opinions. The board shall develop a program for
      informing candidates and the public as to the purpose and effect of  the
      provisions   of   any   voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance  reform
      established by local law.
        8. The board shall have the authority to  promulgate  such  rules  and
      provide  such  forms as it deems necessary for the administration of any
      voluntary system of campaign finance reform established  by  local  law.
      The  board  shall  promulgate  regulations  concerning the form in which
      contributions and expenditures are to be reported,  the  periods  during
      which  such  reports  must  be  filed and the verification required. The
      board  shall  require  the  filing  of  reports  of  contributions   and
      expenditures   for   purposes   of   determining   compliance  with  any
      contribution or  expenditure  limitations  provided  in  any  local  law
      establishing  a  voluntary  system  of campaign finance reform, provided
      that the schedule established by the board for such filings shall be  in
      accordance  with  the schedule specified by the state board of elections
      for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements.
        9. The board shall develop a computer data base that shall contain all
      information necessary for the  proper  administration  of  this  chapter
      including information on contributions to and expenditures by candidates
      and  their  authorized  committees  and distributions of moneys from the
    
      campaign finance funds. Such  data  base  shall  be  accessible  to  the
      public.
        10.  The board may take such other actions as are necessary and proper
      to carry out the purposes of any  local  law  establishing  a  voluntary
      system  of campaign finance reform. If at any time, the board determines
      that the amount of money in any special fund or funds established by any
      such local law, establishing a  voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance
      reform,  to  fund  a  system  of  optional public campaign financing for
      candidates abiding by the requirements of such law, is insufficient,  or
      is  likely  to  be  insufficient,  for  payment  to  such  participating
      candidates pursuant to such law, it shall report this  determination  to
      the  commissioner  of finance, along with its estimate of the additional
      amount which will be necessary to provide such participating  candidates
      with  financing  pursuant  to  such  law and a detailed statement of the
      assumptions and methodologies on which such estimate is based. Not  more
      than  four  days after receiving such estimate and supporting materials,
      the commissioner of finance shall  transfer  an  amount  equal  to  such
      estimate from the general fund to such special fund or funds. All monies
      transferred  to  such  special  fund  or  funds  shall not be considered
      revenues of the city and payments from such fund or funds shall be  made
      without appropriation and shall not be included in the expense budget of
      the  city.  The  comptroller shall have custody of such fund or funds on
      behalf of the board and shall have the power to  invest  the  monies  of
      such  fund  or  funds  in  the manner in which the city is authorized to
      invest its funds and shall deposit the monies of the fund  or  funds  in
      such  deposit  banks  as  have been designated by the banking commission
      pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four  of  this  charter.  The
      comptroller  shall  submit  monthly  reports  to the board regarding the
      status of the fund or funds and more frequent  reports  when  the  board
      requires.  Monies  of  the  fund  or  funds  shall  be  paid  out by the
      comptroller only on warrant of the board.
        11. The board  shall  have  the  authority  to  implement  any  system
      established  for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations
      and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and
      the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as  required  by  local
      law.
        12.  (a)  The board shall require that candidates participating in the
      voluntary system of campaign finance reform or candidates who  otherwise
      file  disclosure  reports with the board shall disclose to the board the
      acceptance of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing
      business with the city. The board shall  promulgate  such  rules  as  it
      deems  necessary  to implement and administer this provision and provide
      that information regarding such contributions shall be accessible to the
      public. The board shall also promulgate such rules as it deems necessary
      to regulate the acceptance by candidates participating in the  voluntary
      system  of  campaign  finance  reform  of  campaign  contributions  from
      individuals and entities doing business with the city,  including  rules
      that  determine  which business dealings shall be covered by such rules.
      Elected officials, city agencies, boards and commissions, including  the
      mayor,  comptroller,  public  advocate,  borough  presidents,  the  city
      council and members of the city council shall cooperate with  the  board
      to  provide  to  the  board  such information about such individuals and
      entities as the board shall require.
        (b) The board shall promulgate such rules as  it  deems  necessary  to
      attribute  expenditures  that  indirectly  assist or benefit a candidate
      participating in the voluntary system  of  campaign  finance  reform  as
      in-kind contributions to such candidate.
    
        (c)  In promulgating rules pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall
      consider the following criteria: (1) the effectiveness of the  voluntary
      system of campaign finance reform, (2) the costs of such system, (3) the
      maintenance  of  a reasonable balance between the burdens of such system
      and the incentives to candidates to participate in such system.
        (d)  Any rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall apply only
      with respect to nomination for election, or election, to the  office  of
      mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the
      city council.
        (e)  Proposed  rules  promulgated  pursuant to this paragraph shall be
      published in accordance with  subdivision  b  of  section  one  thousand
      forty-three  of  this  charter  no  later  than  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Final rules promulgated pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  shall  be  adopted in accordance with such section as soon as
      practicable thereafter. Final rules adopted in the initial  promulgation
      of  rules  pursuant  to  this paragraph shall supersede any inconsistent
      provisions of  the  administrative  code  that  are  in  effect  on  the
      effective date of such final rules.
        13.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the board shall
      prohibit candidates for offices  covered  by  the  voluntary  system  of
      campaign finance reform from accepting, either directly or indirectly, a
      campaign  contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan,
      from any corporation. The board shall promulgate such rules as it  deems
      necessary to implement and administer this provision.
        14  a.  The  council  and  the mayor, in conjunction with the campaign
      finance board, shall develop a curriculum to be used to train members of
      the campaign finance board and staff. Such curriculum shall include  the
      issues  and  problems confronted by campaigns for covered office and how
      the application and enforcement of  the  city's  campaign  finance  laws
      impacts these campaigns.
        15. (a) For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms shall have
      the following meanings:
        (i)  "Independent  expenditure"  shall  mean  a  monetary  or  in-kind
      expenditure made, or liability incurred, in support of or in  opposition
      to  a  candidate  in  a covered election or municipal ballot proposal or
      referendum, where no candidate, nor any  agent  or  political  committee
      authorized   by  a  candidate,  has  authorized,  requested,  suggested,
      fostered or cooperated in  any  such  activity.  The  term  "independent
      expenditure" shall not include:
        (1) the value of services provided without compensation by individuals
      who volunteer a portion or all of their time,

      such services do not exceed five hundred dollars in value,
        (3) the travel expenses of any individual who on his or her own behalf
      volunteers his or her personal services, to the extent such expenses are
      unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value,
        (4) any expenditure made, or liability incurred, that is considered to
      be  a contribution to a candidate under any provision of this charter or
      local law, or under any rule promulgated by the board, and
        (5) any communication by a  labor  or  other  membership  organization
      aimed  at  its  members,  or by a corporation aimed at its stockholders.
      This  exemption  does  not  apply  to  party   committees,   constituted
      committees,  political  clubs, or other entities organized primarily for
      the purpose of influencing elections. For purposes of this subparagraph:
        (A) "member" shall mean (I) any individual who, pursuant to a specific

      "stockholder" as defined in this paragraph.
        (6)  any  de  minimis,  incidental  communication  by a labor or other
      membership   organization   or   corporation   with    non-members    or

      required  to  disclose such expenditure to the board. In addition, every
      entity that, in the twelve months preceding a  covered  election,  makes
      independent  expenditures  aggregating  five thousand dollars or more in
      support of or in opposition to any candidate  in  any  covered  election
      shall disclose the identity of any entity that contributed to the entity
      reporting  the expenditure, and any individual who, in the twelve months
      preceding the covered election, contributed one thousand dollars or more
      to the entity reporting the expenditure.
        (c) Any literature, advertisement or other communication in support of
      or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election that  is  paid
      for   by   an  individual  or  entity  making  independent  expenditures

      each  violation  of this paragraph. The intentional or knowing violation
      of this paragraph shall be punishable as a misdemeanor  in  addition  to

      promulgate such additional rules as it  deems  necessary  to  implement,
      administer,  interpret  and  enforce this paragraph and shall provide in
      such  rules  that  information  regarding  independent  expenditures  be
      promptly  made  accessible  to  the  public  during the covered election
      cycle.
        b. The board shall  take  such  actions  as  it  deems  necessary  and
      appropriate  to improve public awareness of the candidates, proposals or
      referenda in all elections in which there are  contested  elections  for
      the  offices of mayor, public advocate, borough presidents, comptroller,
      or city council or  ballot  proposals  or  referenda  pursuant  to  this
      charter  or  the  municipal home rule law, including but not necessarily
      limited to the publication of a  non-partisan,  impartial  voters  guide
      providing information on candidates, ballot proposals and referenda, and
      the  distribution  of  one copy of such guide to each household in which
      there is at least one registered voter eligible to vote in the  election
      involved.  In  any  year in which the board publishes a voters guide, if
      the board  determines  that  the  amount  of  money  in  its  budget  is
      insufficient  or  likely  to  be  insufficient  for  the publication and
      distribution of the voters guide, it shall report such determination  to
      the  director  of  the  office  of  management  and  budget,  who, after
      consultation with the board, shall, without an  appropriation,  transfer
      to  the  board  a reasonable amount, as the director shall determine, to
      cover the cost of publishing and distributing the voters guide.
        c. The board shall, not later than March tenth of each  year,  approve
      and  submit  to  the  mayor detailed itemized estimates of the financial
      needs of the campaign finance board for the ensuing  fiscal  year.  Such
      estimates  shall  be  comprised of at least one personal service unit of
      appropriation and at least one  other  than  personal  service  unit  of
      appropriation.  The  mayor shall include such estimates in the executive
      budget without revision, but with such recommendations as the mayor  may
      deem  proper.  Upon  inclusion  in  the  executive  budget,  the  budget
      submitted by the campaign finance board shall  be  adopted  pursuant  to
      such  provisions of chapter ten of this charter as are applicable to the
      operating budget of the council.
        d. The board may take such other actions as are necessary  and  proper
      to  carry  out  any  other  authority the city council shall give to the
      board in any local law, including the promulgation of any rules and  the
      provision of any forms.
        e.  The  board  shall  take  such  actions  as  it deems necessary and
      appropriate to encourage, promote, and facilitate voter registration and
      voting by all residents of New York  City  who  are  eligible  to  vote,
      including,   but   not  necessarily  limited  to  the  employment  of  a
      coordinator of voter assistance and other  necessary  staff.  The  board
      shall have authority to promulgate rules in order to implement the voter
      assistance  provisions  of  this  chapter,  except  that  any rules with
      respect to city agency  operations  concerning  voter  registration  and
      voting,  including  but  not  limited  to  implementation of section one
      thousand fifty-seven-a, shall be promulgated  in  conjunction  with  the
      office of the mayor through its office of operations.
