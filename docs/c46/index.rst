Section 1052. ::    
        
     
        §  1052.  Campaign  finance  board.  a.   1. There shall be a campaign
      finance board consisting of five members.   Two  members  of  the  board
      shall  be  appointed  by the mayor, provided that not more than one such
      member shall be enrolled in any one political  party,  and  two  members
      shall be appointed by the speaker of the council, provided that not more
      than  one  such member shall be enrolled in any one political party, and
      one member, who shall be the chairperson,  shall  be  appointed  by  the
      mayor  after  consultation  with the speaker. The members shall first be
      appointed to serve as follows:
        (a) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
        (b) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
        (c) one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;
        (d) one member appointed by the mayor for a term of four years; and
        (e) the chairperson for a term of five years.
        The first  term  shall  commence  on  April  first,  nineteen  hundred
      eighty-eight.  Thereafter,  each member shall be appointed, by the mayor
      or the speaker, according to the original manner of appointment,  for  a
      term  of five years that shall, for any term beginning on or after March
      first two thousand eleven, commence on December first. Terms that  began
      before,  and have not expired on, March first, two thousand eleven shall
      be extended and shall expire on the November thirtieth  following  their
      original  March  thirty-first  expiration  dates. Upon expiration of the
      term of a member, if the mayor or the  speaker,  as  appropriate,  shall
      fail  to  appoint  a  member  within  one  hundred  twenty  days  of the
      expiration of such term, the member whose  term  has  expired  shall  be
      deemed  appointed  for  an  additional  term  of  five  years, provided,
      however, that if the expiration of such term occurs in a year  in  which
      elections,  except special elections, covered by the voluntary system of
      campaign finance reform are scheduled, the member whose term has expired
      shall be deemed appointed for an additional term of five  years  if  the
      mayor  or  the  speaker,  as appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member
      within ninety days of the expiration of such term. In case of a  vacancy
      in  the  office  of  a  member, a member shall be appointed to serve the
      remainder of the unexpired term by the mayor or the  speaker,  according
      to  the  original manner of appointment. If the mayor or the speaker, as
      appropriate, shall fail to appoint a member within  one  hundred  eighty
      days  of  such vacancy, then a member shall be appointed by the board to
      serve for the remainder  of  the  unexpired  term,  if  additional  time
      remains  in such term, provided, however, that if such vacancy occurs in
      a year, or within ninety days prior  to  a  year,  in  which  elections,
      except  special  elections,  covered by the voluntary system of campaign
      finance reform are scheduled, then a member shall be  appointed  by  the
      board  to  serve  for the remainder of the unexpired term, if additional
      time remains in such term, if the mayor or the speaker, as  appropriate,
      shall  fail  to  appoint  a  member  within ninety days of such vacancy.
      Except for the chairperson, such member shall not  be  enrolled  in  the
      same  political  party as the other member appointed by the official who
      failed to so appoint. Each member shall  be  a  resident  of  the  city,
      registered  to  vote  therein.  Each  member  shall  agree  not  to make
      contributions to any candidate for nomination for election, or election,
      to the office of mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president,
      or member of the council which in the aggregate are  in  excess  of  the
      maximum contribution applicable to such office pursuant to any local law
      establishing  a  voluntary  system of campaign finance reform. No member
      shall serve as an officer of a political party, or be  a  candidate,  or
      participate in any capacity in a campaign by a candidate, for nomination
      for  election  or  election  to  the  office  of mayor, public advocate,
      comptroller, borough president or member of the city  council.  Officers
    
      and employees of the city or any city agency, lobbyists required to file
      a  statement  of  registration under section 3-213 of the administrative
      code and the employees of such lobbyists shall not  be  eligible  to  be
      members  of the board. In appointing members to the board, the mayor and
      the  speaker  shall  consider  campaign  experience   in   general   and
      particularly campaign experience with the New York city campaign finance
      system.  Members  of  the  board  shall  be required to undergo training
      developed pursuant to paragraph 14 of this section.
        2. The members of the board shall be compensated at the  rate  of  one
      hundred dollars per calendar day when performing the work of the board.
        3.  The  board  may  employ  necessary  staff,  including an executive
      director and a counsel,  and  make  necessary  expenditures  subject  to
      appropriation.
        4.  No  member  of  the  campaign  finance board shall be removed from
      office except for cause and upon notice and hearing.
        5. The board shall have the power to investigate all matters  relating
      to the performance of its functions and any other matter relating to the
      proper administration of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
      established  by  local law and for such purposes shall have the power to
      require the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath  of
      such persons as it shall deem necessary and to require the production of
      books,   accounts,   papers   and   other   evidence  relative  to  such
      investigation.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision   of   law,   the
      investigative  and adjudicatory powers and functions of the staff to the
      board shall be separate and no staff member of the board  shall  perform
      both investigative and adjudicatory tasks or functions.
        6.  The  board  shall publicize, as it deems appropriate, the names of
      candidates for nomination or election to the  office  of  mayor,  public
      advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president, or city council who violate
      any of the provisions of any voluntary system of campaign finance reform
      established by local law.
        7. The board may render advisory opinions with  respect  to  questions
      arising  under any local law establishing a voluntary system of campaign
      finance reform. Such advisory opinions may be rendered  on  the  written
      request of a candidate, an officer of a political committee or member of
      the  public,  or  may be rendered on its own initiative. The board shall
      make public its advisory opinions. The board shall develop a program for
      informing candidates and the public as to the purpose and effect of  the
      provisions   of   any   voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance  reform
      established by local law.
        8. The board shall have the authority to  promulgate  such  rules  and
      provide  such  forms as it deems necessary for the administration of any
      voluntary system of campaign finance reform established  by  local  law.
      The  board  shall  promulgate  regulations  concerning the form in which
      contributions and expenditures are to be reported,  the  periods  during
      which  such  reports  must  be  filed and the verification required. The
      board  shall  require  the  filing  of  reports  of  contributions   and
      expenditures   for   purposes   of   determining   compliance  with  any
      contribution or  expenditure  limitations  provided  in  any  local  law
      establishing  a  voluntary  system  of campaign finance reform, provided
      that the schedule established by the board for such filings shall be  in
      accordance  with  the schedule specified by the state board of elections
      for the filing of campaign receipt and expenditure statements.
        9. The board shall develop a computer data base that shall contain all
      information necessary for the  proper  administration  of  this  chapter
      including information on contributions to and expenditures by candidates
      and  their  authorized  committees  and distributions of moneys from the
    
      campaign finance funds. Such  data  base  shall  be  accessible  to  the
      public.
        10.  The board may take such other actions as are necessary and proper
      to carry out the purposes of any  local  law  establishing  a  voluntary
      system  of campaign finance reform. If at any time, the board determines
      that the amount of money in any special fund or funds established by any
      such local law, establishing a  voluntary  system  of  campaign  finance
      reform,  to  fund  a  system  of  optional public campaign financing for
      candidates abiding by the requirements of such law, is insufficient,  or
      is  likely  to  be  insufficient,  for  payment  to  such  participating
      candidates pursuant to such law, it shall report this  determination  to
      the  commissioner  of finance, along with its estimate of the additional
      amount which will be necessary to provide such participating  candidates
      with  financing  pursuant  to  such  law and a detailed statement of the
      assumptions and methodologies on which such estimate is based. Not  more
      than  four  days after receiving such estimate and supporting materials,
      the commissioner of finance shall  transfer  an  amount  equal  to  such
      estimate from the general fund to such special fund or funds. All monies
      transferred  to  such  special  fund  or  funds  shall not be considered
      revenues of the city and payments from such fund or funds shall be  made
      without appropriation and shall not be included in the expense budget of
      the  city.  The  comptroller shall have custody of such fund or funds on
      behalf of the board and shall have the power to  invest  the  monies  of
      such  fund  or  funds  in  the manner in which the city is authorized to
      invest its funds and shall deposit the monies of the fund  or  funds  in
      such  deposit  banks  as  have been designated by the banking commission
      pursuant to section fifteen hundred twenty-four  of  this  charter.  The
      comptroller  shall  submit  monthly  reports  to the board regarding the
      status of the fund or funds and more frequent  reports  when  the  board
      requires.  Monies  of  the  fund  or  funds  shall  be  paid  out by the
      comptroller only on warrant of the board.
        11. The board  shall  have  the  authority  to  implement  any  system
      established  for the regulation of inauguration and transition donations
      and expenditures including the promulgation of rules and regulations and
      the imposition of any penalties related thereto, as  required  by  local
      law.
        12.  (a)  The board shall require that candidates participating in the
      voluntary system of campaign finance reform or candidates who  otherwise
      file  disclosure  reports with the board shall disclose to the board the
      acceptance of campaign contributions from individuals and entities doing
      business with the city. The board shall  promulgate  such  rules  as  it
      deems  necessary  to implement and administer this provision and provide
      that information regarding such contributions shall be accessible to the
      public. The board shall also promulgate such rules as it deems necessary
      to regulate the acceptance by candidates participating in the  voluntary
      system  of  campaign  finance  reform  of  campaign  contributions  from
      individuals and entities doing business with the city,  including  rules
      that  determine  which business dealings shall be covered by such rules.
      Elected officials, city agencies, boards and commissions, including  the
      mayor,  comptroller,  public  advocate,  borough  presidents,  the  city
      council and members of the city council shall cooperate with  the  board
      to  provide  to  the  board  such information about such individuals and
      entities as the board shall require.
        (b) The board shall promulgate such rules as  it  deems  necessary  to
      attribute  expenditures  that  indirectly  assist or benefit a candidate
      participating in the voluntary system  of  campaign  finance  reform  as
      in-kind contributions to such candidate.
    
        (c)  In promulgating rules pursuant to this paragraph, the board shall
      consider the following criteria: (1) the effectiveness of the  voluntary
      system of campaign finance reform, (2) the costs of such system, (3) the
      maintenance  of  a reasonable balance between the burdens of such system
      and the incentives to candidates to participate in such system.
        (d)  Any rules promulgated pursuant to this paragraph shall apply only
      with respect to nomination for election, or election, to the  office  of
      mayor, public advocate, comptroller, borough president, or member of the
      city council.
        (e)  Proposed  rules  promulgated  pursuant to this paragraph shall be
      published in accordance with  subdivision  b  of  section  one  thousand
      forty-three  of  this  charter  no  later  than  December  thirty-first,
      nineteen hundred ninety-nine. Final rules promulgated pursuant  to  this
      paragraph  shall  be  adopted in accordance with such section as soon as
      practicable thereafter. Final rules adopted in the initial  promulgation
      of  rules  pursuant  to  this paragraph shall supersede any inconsistent
      provisions of  the  administrative  code  that  are  in  effect  on  the
      effective date of such final rules.
        13.  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  the board shall
      prohibit candidates for offices  covered  by  the  voluntary  system  of
      campaign finance reform from accepting, either directly or indirectly, a
      campaign  contribution, loan, guarantee or other security for such loan,
      from any corporation. The board shall promulgate such rules as it  deems
      necessary to implement and administer this provision.
        14  a.  The  council  and  the mayor, in conjunction with the campaign
      finance board, shall develop a curriculum to be used to train members of
      the campaign finance board and staff. Such curriculum shall include  the
      issues  and  problems confronted by campaigns for covered office and how
      the application and enforcement of  the  city's  campaign  finance  laws
      impacts these campaigns.
        15. (a) For purposes of this paragraph, the following terms shall have
      the following meanings:
        (i)  "Independent  expenditure"  shall  mean  a  monetary  or  in-kind
      expenditure made, or liability incurred, in support of or in  opposition
      to  a  candidate  in  a covered election or municipal ballot proposal or
      referendum, where no candidate, nor any  agent  or  political  committee
      authorized   by  a  candidate,  has  authorized,  requested,  suggested,
      fostered or cooperated in  any  such  activity.  The  term  "independent
      expenditure" shall not include:
        (1) the value of services provided without compensation by individuals
      who volunteer a portion or all of their time,

      such services do not exceed five hundred dollars in value,
        (3) the travel expenses of any individual who on his or her own behalf
      volunteers his or her personal services, to the extent such expenses are
      unreimbursed and do not exceed five hundred dollars in value,
        (4) any expenditure made, or liability incurred, that is considered to
      be  a contribution to a candidate under any provision of this charter or
      local law, or under any rule promulgated by the board, and
        (5) any communication by a  labor  or  other  membership  organization
      aimed  at  its  members,  or by a corporation aimed at its stockholders.
      This  exemption  does  not  apply  to  party   committees,   constituted
      committees,  political  clubs, or other entities organized primarily for
      the purpose of influencing elections. For purposes of this subparagraph:
        (A) "member" shall mean (I) any individual who, pursuant to a specific
      provision of an organization's articles or bylaws, has the right to vote

      dividends, or any individual who resides within the same household as  a
      "stockholder" as defined in this paragraph.
        (6)  any  de  minimis,  incidental  communication  by a labor or other
      membership   organization   or   corporation   with    non-members    or
      non-stockholders,   provided   that   the   labor  or  other  membership

        (b)  Every  individual  and entity that makes independent expenditures

      required  to  disclose such expenditure to the board. In addition, every
      entity that, in the twelve months preceding a  covered  election,  makes
      independent  expenditures  aggregating  five thousand dollars or more in
      support of or in opposition to any candidate  in  any  covered  election
      shall disclose the identity of any entity that contributed to the entity
      reporting  the expenditure, and any individual who, in the twelve months
      preceding the covered election, contributed one thousand dollars or more
      to the entity reporting the expenditure.
        (c) Any literature, advertisement or other communication in support of
      or in opposition to any candidate in any covered election that  is  paid
      for   by   an  individual  or  entity  making  independent  expenditures
      aggregating one thousand dollars or more shall disclose the name of  any
      individual or entity making the expenditure.
        (d)  The  board  may,  upon notice and opportunity to be heard, assess
      civil penalties in an amount not in excess of ten thousand  dollars  for
      each  violation  of this paragraph. The intentional or knowing violation
      of this paragraph shall be punishable as a misdemeanor  in  addition  to
      any other penalty provided under law.
        (e) The board shall promulgate rules concerning the form and manner in
      which  independent  expenditures  are  to be reported and disclosed, the
      information to be reported  and  disclosed,  the  periods  during  which

      promulgate such additional rules as it  deems  necessary  to  implement,
      administer,  interpret  and  enforce this paragraph and shall provide in
      such  rules  that  information  regarding  independent  expenditures  be
      promptly  made  accessible  to  the  public  during the covered election
      cycle.
        b. The board shall  take  such  actions  as  it  deems  necessary  and
      appropriate  to improve public awareness of the candidates, proposals or
      referenda in all elections in which there are  contested  elections  for
      the  offices of mayor, public advocate, borough presidents, comptroller,
      or city council or  ballot  proposals  or  referenda  pursuant  to  this
      charter  or  the  municipal home rule law, including but not necessarily
      limited to the publication of a  non-partisan,  impartial  voters  guide
      providing information on candidates, ballot proposals and referenda, and
      the  distribution  of  one copy of such guide to each household in which
      there is at least one registered voter eligible to vote in the  election
      involved.  In  any  year in which the board publishes a voters guide, if
      the board  determines  that  the  amount  of  money  in  its  budget  is
      insufficient  or  likely  to  be  insufficient  for  the publication and
      distribution of the voters guide, it shall report such determination  to
      the  director  of  the  office  of  management  and  budget,  who, after
      consultation with the board, shall, without an  appropriation,  transfer
      to  the  board  a reasonable amount, as the director shall determine, to
      cover the cost of publishing and distributing the voters guide.
        c. The board shall, not later than March tenth of each  year,  approve
      and  submit  to  the  mayor detailed itemized estimates of the financial
      needs of the campaign finance board for the ensuing  fiscal  year.  Such
      estimates  shall  be  comprised of at least one personal service unit of
      appropriation and at least one  other  than  personal  service  unit  of
      appropriation.  The  mayor shall include such estimates in the executive
      budget without revision, but with such recommendations as the mayor  may
      deem  proper.  Upon  inclusion  in  the  executive  budget,  the  budget
      submitted by the campaign finance board shall  be  adopted  pursuant  to
      such  provisions of chapter ten of this charter as are applicable to the
      operating budget of the council.
        d. The board may take such other actions as are necessary  and  proper
      to  carry  out  any  other  authority the city council shall give to the
      board in any local law, including the promulgation of any rules and  the
      provision of any forms.
        e.  The  board  shall  take  such  actions  as  it deems necessary and
      appropriate to encourage, promote, and facilitate voter registration and
      voting by all residents of New York  City  who  are  eligible  to  vote,
      including,   but   not  necessarily  limited  to  the  employment  of  a
      coordinator of voter assistance and other  necessary  staff.  The  board
      shall have authority to promulgate rules in order to implement the voter
      assistance  provisions  of  this  chapter,  except  that  any rules with
      respect to city agency  operations  concerning  voter  registration  and
      voting,  including  but  not  limited  to  implementation of section one
      thousand fifty-seven-a, shall be promulgated  in  conjunction  with  the
      office of the mayor through its office of operations.

      assist the  board  with  its  duties  and  responsibilities  under  this
      chapter,  including  but  not limited to overseeing the voter assistance
      program established by this chapter. Two members shall be  appointed  by
      the mayor, provided that not more than one such member shall be enrolled
      in  any  one  political  party;  two  members  shall be appointed by the
      speaker of the city council, provided that not more than one such member
      shall be enrolled in any  one  political  party;  one  member  shall  be
      appointed  by  the  comptroller;  one  member  shall be appointed by the
      borough presidents acting together; and one member shall be appointed by
      the mayor in consultation with the speaker and shall serve as chair.  In
      addition,  the committee shall include the public advocate, or in his or
      her absence, a representative, and the executive director of  the  board
      of  elections  (or, in his or her absence, the deputy executive director
      of the board of elections). In appointing members to the committee,  the
      mayor,  speaker,  comptroller  and  borough  presidents  shall  consider
      experience  with  groups   or   categories   of   residents   that   are
      underrepresented  among those who vote or among those who are registered
      to vote and community, voter registration, civil  rights,  and  disabled
      groups.  The  appointed  members  shall  first  be appointed to serve as
      follows:
        1. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of one year;
        2. one member appointed by the mayor for a term of two years;
        3. one member appointed by the speaker for a term of three years;

      for a term of five years.
        Each term shall  commence  on  January  first,  two  thousand  eleven.
      Thereafter,  each  member  shall  be  appointed for a term of five years
      according to the original manner of appointment. Upon expiration of  the
      term  of a member, if the appointing official or officials shall fail to
      appoint a member within one hundred twenty days  of  the  expiration  of
      such  term,  the member whose term has expired shall be deemed appointed
      for an additional term of five years. In case of a vacancy in the office
      of an appointed member, a member shall be appointed  to  serve  for  the
      remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  according to the original manner of
      appointment. For appointees of the mayor or speaker, such  member  shall
      not  be  enrolled  in  the  same  political  party  as  the other member
      appointed by the official making the appointment to  fill  the  vacancy.
      Each member shall be a resident of the city, registered to vote therein.
      No  member other than the public advocate shall serve as an officer of a
      political party, or be a candidate, or participate in any capacity in  a
      campaign  by a candidate, for nomination for election or election to the
      office of mayor, public  advocate,  comptroller,  borough  president  or
      member  of  the  city  council. The members of the committee shall serve

        § 1057-a. Agency based voter registration. Each agency designated as a
      participating   agency  under  the  provisions  of  this  section  shall
      implement and administer a program of distribution of voter registration
      forms pursuant to the provisions of this section. The following  offices
      are  hereby designated as participating voter registration agencies: The
      administration for children's services, the  city  clerk,  the  civilian
      complaint  review  board,  the  commission  on  human  rights, community
      boards, the department of small business  services,  the  department  of

      mandate in all new  or  renewed  agreements  with  those  subcontractors
      having  regular  contact  with the public in the daily administration of
      their  business  to  follow  the  guidelines  of  this   section.   Such
      participating  agencies  shall  be  required to offer voter registration
      forms to all persons together with written  applications  for  services,
      renewal  or  recertification for services and change of address relating
      to such services; provided however that this section shall not apply  to
      services  that must be provided to prevent actual or potential danger to
      the life, health, or safety of any individual or  of  the  public.  Such
      agencies  may  provide  assistance  to  applicants  in  completing voter
      registration forms, if so requested. Such agencies may  also,  in  their
      discretion, receive and transmit the completed application form from any
      applicants  who  wish  to  have  such  form  transmitted to the board of
      elections for the city of New York.
        1. Participating agencies shall adopt such rules  and  regulations  as
      may  be  necessary to implement this section. The campaign finance board
      shall prepare and distribute to participating agencies written  advisory
      agency  guidelines  as  to  the  implementation  of this section and may
      establish training programs for  employees  of  participating  agencies;
      provided  that  any  guidelines  promulgated  by  the  voter  assistance
      commission prior to the effective date of this clause  shall  remain  in
      effect  unless  further  amended or repealed by the board. Participating
      agencies  may  consider  such  advisory   agency   guidelines   in   the
      promulgation of their rules and regulations.
        2.   Participating   agencies   shall  provide  and  distribute  voter
      registration forms to all persons together with written applications for
      services, renewal or recertification for services and change of  address
      relating  to such services; provided however that this section shall not
      apply to services that must be provided to prevent actual  or  potential
      danger  to  life,  health  or safety of any individual or of the public.
      Participating agency staff may provide assistance  in  completing  these
      distributed  voter  registration  forms,  if so requested. Participating
      agencies shall also include a voter registration form  with  any  agency
      communication  sent  through  the  United States mail for the purpose of
      supplying clients  with  application,  renewal  or  recertification  for
      services  and  change  of  address  relating to such services materials.
      Participating agencies shall also incorporate an opportunity to  request
      a  voter  registration  application  into  any application for services,
      renewal or recertification for services and change of  address  relating
      to  such  services provided on computer terminals, the World Wide Web or
      the Internet. Any person indicating that they wish to be  sent  a  voter
      registration  form,  via  computer  terminals, the World Wide Web or the
    
      Internet shall be sent such a  form  by  the  participating  agency,  or
      directed to a bank on that system where such a form may be downloaded.
        3. Participating agencies shall also:
        a. at the earliest practicable or next regularly scheduled printing of
      their  forms,  physically  incorporate the voter registration forms with
      their  own  application  forms  in  a  manner  that  permits  the  voter
      registration  portion to be detached therefrom. Until such time when the
      agency amends its form, each agency should affix or  include  a  postage
      paid board of elections for the city of New York voter registration form
      to  or  with  its  application,  renewal,  recertification and change of
      address forms;
        b. use the board of elections of the city  of  New  York  coded  voter
      registration  forms  which  designate  such  forms  as  originating from
      participating agencies: and
        c. transmit any completed forms collected in their discretion  to  the
      board  of  elections  of  the  city  of New York within two weeks of the
      receipt of such completed  forms  at  the  participating  agency.  If  a
      completed  form  is  accepted  within  five days before the last day for
      registration to vote in a citywide election, such completed  form  shall
      be  transmitted by the participating agency to the board of elections of
      the city of New York  not  later  than  five  days  after  the  date  of
      acceptance.
        4.  All persons seeking voter registration forms and information shall
      be advised in writing together with other written materials provided  by
      agencies  or  by  appropriate publicity that government services are not
      conditioned on being registered to vote. No statement shall be made  nor
      any  action taken by an agency employee to discourage the applicant from
      registering to vote or to enroll in any particular political party.
        5. The completion of the voter registration form by  an  applicant  is
      voluntary.
        6.  Employees of a participating agency who provide voter registration
      assistance shall not:
        a. seek to influence an  applicant's  political  preference  or  party
      designation;
        b. display any political preference or party allegiance;
        c.  make  any statement to an applicant or take any action the purpose
      or effect of which is to discourage the applicant  from  registering  to
      vote; or
        d.  make  any statement to an applicant or take any action the purpose
      or effect of which is to lead the applicant to believe that  a  decision
      to  register  or  not to register has any bearing on the availability of
      services or benefits.
        7. Each participating agency, department,  division  and  office  that
      makes  available  voter  registration  forms  shall  prominently display
      promotional materials designed and approved by the  board  of  elections
      for  the  city  of New York or state board of elections for use in state
      agency programs.
