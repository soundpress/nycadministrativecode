        §  94.  Deputy  comptrollers  and other appointees. a. The comptroller
      shall appoint  and  at  pleasure  remove  a  first,  and  second  deputy
      comptroller.  The comptroller may appoint and at pleasure remove a third
      deputy  comptroller who shall be a person qualified to advise and assist
      the comptroller in all matters relating to borrowings and the investment
      of funds. Except as provided in subdivision b of this section,  each  of
      the  deputies  and  any officer or employee appointed by the comptroller
      shall have such powers and duties as may be assigned to such  person  by
      the  comptroller  by  instrument  in  writing filed with the city clerk.
      Provided however that no more  than  five  such  additionally  appointed
      officers  or  employees shall serve simultaneously. The city clerk shall
      notify the council of the filing or revocation of each such appointment.
        b. Any deputy comptroller or any officer or employee appointed by  the
      comptroller  may  act  in place of the comptroller on any board, body or
      committee of which the comptroller is a member whenever the  comptroller
      shall  so authorize in writing and such authorization is filed with such
      board, body or committee and with the city clerk.
        c. Any vacancy in the office of comptroller shall be filled by popular
      election, in the manner set forth in this subdivision. In the event of a
      vacancy in the office of  comptroller  until  an  interim  or  permanent
      successor  is  first elected, or whenever by reason of sickness, absence
      from the city or  suspension  from  office,  the  comptroller  shall  be
      prevented  from  attending  to  the  duties  of the office, or while the
      comptroller is acting as mayor, the first deputy comptroller or  in  the
      case  of  his or her illness or absence the second deputy comptroller or
      in the  case  of  his  or  her  illness  or  absence  the  third  deputy
      comptroller shall act as comptroller.
        1.  Within  three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of
      the comptroller, the mayor shall proclaim the date for the  election  or
      elections   required   by  this  subdivision,  provide  notice  of  such
      proclamation to the city clerk and the board of  elections  and  publish
      notice  thereof  in  the City Record. After the proclamation of the date
      for an election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five  of  this
      subdivision,  the  city clerk shall publish notice thereof not less than
      twice in each week preceding the date of  such  election  in  newspapers
      distributed  within  the  city,  and  the  board of elections shall mail
      notice of such election to all registered voters within the city.
        2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years  of  the  term,  a
      general  election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired
      term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs,  unless  the
      vacancy  occurs  after the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be
      filled at the general election in that same year with party  nominations
      of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary election, as
      provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy  occurs
      in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of
      the  unexpired  term  at  the  general  election  in  the following year
      provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy  shall  be
      held  in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine
      of this subdivision. Party  nominations  of  candidates  for  a  general
      election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall
      be  made  at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of
      this subdivision.
        3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an  interim
      basis  has  not  been  previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six,
      seven and eight of this subdivision, the  person  elected  to  fill  the
      vacancy  for  the  remainder of the unexpired term at a general election
      shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall  serve  until
      the  term  expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy
    
      on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
      the vacancy for the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  at  a  general
      election  shall  take office on January first of the year following such
      general election and shall serve until the term expires.
        4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on
      or  before  the  last  day  in  the  third  year of the term on which an
      occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
      at  a  general  election  with  party nominations of candidates for such
      election being made at a primary election, as provided in section  6-116
      of  the  election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy
      on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs  less  than
      ninety  days before the next primary election at which party nominations
      for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or  before
      the  last  day  on  which  an  occurring  vacancy  may be filled for the
      remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year
      in which the vacancy occurs with party  nominations  of  candidates  for
      such  election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section
      6-116 of the election law.
        5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day in the  third  year  of  the
      term  on  which  an occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of
      the unexpired term at  a  general  election  in  each  year  with  party
      nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
      election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less
      than ninety days before the date of the primary election in  the  fourth
      year  of  such  term, a special or general election to fill such vacancy
      for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held.
        6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
      subdivision  shall  be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner: a special
      election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
      forty-five days after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided  that  the
      mayor,   in   the   proclamation  required  by  paragraph  one  of  this
      subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
      days after such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days  after  such
      proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
      to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
        (a)  if  the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and
      the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence  of  the
      vacancy  is  less  than ninety days before a regularly scheduled general
      election or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy  shall
      be filled at such general election; and
        (b)  if  the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any year and
      the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence  of  the
      vacancy  is  after  a  regularly scheduled general election, the vacancy
      shall be filled at such general election; and
        (c) if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any  year
      and  the  first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of
      the vacancy is after, but less  than  thirty  days  after,  a  regularly
      scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy shall be filled at a special
      election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
        7. All nominations for elections to fill vacancies  held  pursuant  to
      paragraphs  four  and  five  of this subdivision shall be by independent
      nominating petition. A signature on an independent  nominating  petition
      made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
      of this subdivision shall not be counted.
        8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the comptroller
      at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall
      take  office  immediately  upon  qualification  and serve until December
      thirty-first of the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled  for  the
    
      remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  pursuant  to  paragraph two of this
      subdivision. A person elected to fill a vacancy in  the  office  of  the
      comptroller  at  an  election  held  pursuant  to paragraph five of this

        9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
      primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
      general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
