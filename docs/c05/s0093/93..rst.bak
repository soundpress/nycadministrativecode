Section 93. ::    
        
     
        §  93.  Powers and duties. a. The comptroller from time to time in his
      or her discretion may, and whenever required by law or requested by  the
      mayor  or  the  council,  shall  advise the mayor and the council on the
      financial condition of the city or  any  phase  thereof  and  make  such
      recommendations,  comments  and  criticisms in regard to the operations,
      fiscal policies and financial transactions of the city as he or she  may
      deem advisable in the public interest.
        b.  The  comptroller  shall  have  power  to audit and investigate all
      matters relating to or affecting the finances  of  the  city,  including
      without  limitation  the  performance  of  contracts and the receipt and
      expenditure of city funds, and for such  purpose  shall  have  power  to
      require  the attendance and examine and take the testimony under oath of
      such persons as the comptroller may deem  necessary.    The  comptroller
      shall  conduct  all  audits  of entities under contract with the city as
      expeditiously as possible and in no case shall initiate an  audit  later
      than  two  years  after  the  expiration  of  a contract term unless the
      comptroller determines in writing that: (1) such audit is  initiated  in
      connection  with  litigation  brought by or against the city, (2) it was
      not practicable to initiate an audit within such two year period, or (3)
      the initiation of the audit after the two year period is appropriate  in
      light  of  information discovered in an audit of another contract of the
      same contractor. Such written determination  shall  be  filed  with  the
      mayor, council and public advocate.
        c.  The comptroller shall have power to audit all agencies, as defined
      in subdivision two of section eleven hundred fifty,  and  all  agencies,
      the  majority  of  whose  members  are  appointed by city officials. The
      comptroller shall  be  entitled  to  obtain  access  to  agency  records
      required  by  law  to be kept confidential, other than records which are
      protected by the privileges for attorney-client communications, attorney
      work  products,  or   material   prepared   for   litigation,   upon   a
      representation  by  the comptroller that necessary and appropriate steps
      will be taken to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  such  records.  The
      comptroller  shall establish a regular auditing cycle to ensure that one
      or more of the programs or activities of each city  agency,  or  one  or
      more aspects of each agency's operations, is audited at least once every
      four  years.  The  audits conducted by the comptroller shall comply with
      generally accepted government auditing  standards.  In  accordance  with
      such  standards, and before any draft or final audit or audit report, or
      portion thereof, may be made public, the comptroller shall send  a  copy
      of the draft audit or audit report to the head of the audited agency and
      provide  the  agency,  in  writing,  with  a reasonable deadline for its
      review and response. The comptroller shall include copies  of  any  such
      agency  response in any draft or final audit or audit report, or portion
      thereof, which is made public. The comptroller shall send copies of  all
      final  audits and audit reports to the council, the mayor, and the audit
      committee.
        d. The comptroller shall (1) audit financial transactions of the city,
      including vouchers, warrants,  and  payrolls;  (2)  audit  all  official
      accounts  and  the  accrual  and collection annually of all revenues and
      receipts; and (3) audit the expenditure of city funds by any  public  or
      private agency that receives such funds from the city.
        e.  The  comptroller  shall  audit the operations and programs of city
      agencies to determine whether  funds  are  being  expended  or  utilized
      efficiently  and  economically and whether the desired goals, results or
      benefits of agency programs are being achieved.  The  comptroller  shall
      investigate  the processing of vouchers and the payment of bills by city
      agencies and shall audit agency compliance with applicable procedures in
      procuring goods, services and construction. The comptroller  shall  also
    
      undertake studies, including cost benefit analyses, of: (i) purchases of
      goods,  services,  and  construction  by agencies of government that use
      city funds for such purposes and  (ii)  the  adoption  and  use  of  new
      technology by city agencies to promote their economy and efficiency, and
      periodically  report the findings and recommendations of such studies to
      the mayor, the council and the public.
        f. Not later than the first day of March of each year, the comptroller
      shall deliver to the mayor and council a  report  describing  all  major
      audits of city agencies conducted by the comptroller during the previous
      fiscal  year;  the  corrective  actions  recommended in such audits; the
      corrective actions which  have  been  implemented  to  the  extent  such
      information  is known to the comptroller on the basis of agency reports,
      comptroller audits, or otherwise; and the comptroller's recommendations,
      if any, for additional corrective actions.
        g. The comptroller shall have power and it shall be his duty to  audit
      all  vouchers  before  payment  for  availability  of  funds and prepare
      warrants. No  warrant  shall  be  prepared  by  the  comptroller  unless
      sufficient  appropriations are available to cover the payments involved.
      No agency shall expend or  commit  any  funds  otherwise  than  for  the
      program  and purposes for which the funds have been appropriated and the
      comptroller shall conduct audits  and  take  such  other  action  as  is
      required to assure compliance with this provision.
        h. Except as provided in subdivision g, the agencies shall prepare and
      audit  vouchers  before payment, prepare and audit payrolls, receive and
      inspect goods and forward vouchers to the comptroller for  payment.  The
      comptroller  shall  prescribe  methods,  with  which  all agencies shall
      comply, for preparing and auditing vouchers  before  payment,  preparing
      payrolls,  and  recording,  reporting  and  accounting  in  the  several
      agencies  and  shall  conduct  reviews  to  assure  compliance.      The
      comptroller may suspend or withdraw the authority delegated to an agency
      pursuant  to  this  subdivision  (1)  upon  a  finding  of abuse of such
      authority or on a determination that the agency lacks adequate  internal
      controls  to  exercise such authority properly and (2) upon the approval
      of the audit committee after the agency has had  an  opportunity  to  be
      heard on this matter.
        i.  The  comptroller  shall  have  the  power to settle and adjust all
      claims in favor of or against the  city  in  such  manner  as  shall  be
      prescribed  by  law  and  for  that purpose may administer oaths, except
      that, with regard to excise and non-property taxes, such power shall  be
      vested in the commissioner of finance.  The comptroller shall not revise
      the  terms of a contract or agreement with the city after its execution.
      The city may include in construction contracts or agreements for capital
      projects provisions that authorize the comptroller  to  submit  disputes
      arising under any such contract or agreement to impartial arbitration.
        j.  The  comptroller  shall  administer and manage the several sinking
      funds of the city and all other  trust  funds  held  by  the  city,  and
      provide  for  the  receipt  and safekeeping of all moneys in such funds,
      except as provided in  paragraph  b  of  subdivision  three  of  section
      fifteen  hundred  four  of  this charter, and in such administration the
      comptroller shall be deemed to be acting in a fiduciary capacity.
        k. The comptroller shall keep the accounts of the city  and  shall  at
      least once in each month render to each agency a summary statement of so
      much thereof as relates to such agency.
        l.  Within  four  months  after  the  close  of  each fiscal year, the
      comptroller shall publish a statement for such year,  including  a  full
      and  detailed statement of the revenues and expenditures of the city and
      the surplus at the end of the fiscal year, including the  average  daily
      collected  deposits  in  bank  accounts  of  the  city,  the  investment
    
      performance of city pension and  other  investment  funds,  an  itemized
      statement  of  all  taxes due and uncollected at the close of the fiscal
      year, the reserve for estimated uncollectible taxes, and the uncollected
      parking  violation  fines  receivable,  an  itemized  statement  of  the
      condition of the sinking funds, and  any  other  assessable  improvement
      funds,  and  of  the  tax  appropriation  and general fund stabilization
      reserve fund as at the close of the fiscal year, the  different  sources
      of  city revenue, including itemization of receivables due from state or
      federal sources by program and fiscal year, and the amount received from
      each, the several appropriations made for the fiscal year,  the  objects
      for which they were made and the amount of expenditures made under each,
      the  money  borrowed on the credit of the city, the amount of each loan,
      the authority under which it was made and the  terms  on  which  it  was
      obtained,  and  such  other information in regard to such fiscal year as
      may be determined by the comptroller or by law.
        m. The comptroller shall establish for his or her office and  for  all
      city  agencies  a  uniform  system  of accounting and reporting based on
      generally accepted accounting principles.
        1. Such uniform system of accounts shall provide:
          (a) control accounts in the  office  of  the  comptroller  that  are
      consistent with budgeted units of appropriation and that are adequate to
      record and control spending by the agencies and to prevent agencies from
      exceeding appropriations;
        (b)  detailed  accounts  in  the  agencies  for  the  purposes of cost
      accounting,  rate  of  expenditure  information  and  other   management
      information data; and
        (c)  geographic  accounts  for the reporting of expenditures for local
      service districts of agencies within community districts and boroughs.
        2. The comptroller  shall  prescribe  procedures  for  accounting  and
      reporting  for  all  agencies, and review agency accounts and systems to
      assure compliance with this chapter and with the methods, standards  and
      procedures prescribed by the comptroller for the agencies.
        n.  The  comptroller  shall  prescribe  systems of accounting for city
      agencies whose revenues arising out of the use  of  the  facilities  and
      services  supplied  by such agencies constitute fifty per centum or more
      of the appropriations provided for the operation of such agencies, which
      systems of accounting shall conform so far as  practicable  to  standard
      public  utility  accounting  practices. The comptroller shall publish in
      the comptroller's annual report the financial statements for  such  city
      agencies.
        o. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law
      or  this charter or any contract heretofore or hereafter made or awarded
      by the city of New York or by any agency, department or authority acting
      on its behalf, the comptroller may, at his or her discretion, turn  over
      the  physical  custody  and  safekeeping of bonds, notes, obligations or
      other evidences of indebtedness which have been  or  will  be  deposited
      with  the  comptroller  as  collateral  security  as  required by law or
      contract to a custodian who  may  be  (a)  any  bank  or  trust  company
      incorporated  in  the  state,  or  (b)  any national bank located in the
      state, or (c) any private banker duly authorized by  the  superintendent
      of  banks  of this state to engage in business here. The comptroller may
      enter into a contract with such custodian  under  terms  and  conditions
      which the comptroller may require. Each depositor of collateral security
      shall  bear  a  proportionate  share  of  the  cost  of  such  custodial
      safekeeping which shall be paid to the city of New York.
        p. No contract or agreement executed pursuant to this charter or other
      law shall be implemented until (1)  a  copy  has  been  filed  with  the
      comptroller  and  (2)  the  comptroller has registered it, in accordance
    
      with sections three hundred twenty-eight and three hundred  seventy-five
      of the charter.
        q. The council shall periodically review the requirements contained in
      the  charter for studies and reports by the comptroller and may by local
      law revise such requirements as it deems appropriate. At such  times  as
      the  mayor or the council shall request, the comptroller shall submit to
      them such  information  as  they  may  request.  The  comptroller,  upon
      request,  shall  assist  the  council  in  the  conduct  of  any  of its
      investigations or studies of the fiscal or economic affairs of the  city
      or  of  any agency. The comptroller shall provide reports to the council
      upon request and  shall  testify  before  the  council  or  a  committee
      thereof.
        r.  The  comptroller  shall  make a complete transcript of each public
      hearing conducted by the office available for public inspection free  of
      charge within sixty days after such hearing.  The comptroller shall also
      provide a copy of any requested pages of such transcript at a reasonable
      fee to cover copying and, if relevant, mailing costs.
