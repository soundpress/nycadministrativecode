Where the living wage is greater than the prevailing wage, the city service contractor or city service subcontractor must either provide its employees health benefits or must supplement their hourly wage rate by an amount no less than the health benefits supplement rate. Where the prevailing wage is greater than the living wage, the city service contractor or city service subcontractor must provide its employees the prevailing wage and supplements as provided in paragraph 18 of subdivision a of this section. These requirements apply for each hour that the employee works performing the city service contract or subcontract.

   (2) The Living Wage. The living wage shall be an hourly wage rate of ten dollars per hour and will be phased in as provided below. Provided, however, that for homecare services under the Personal Care Services program, the wage and health rates below shall only apply as long as the state and federal government maintain their combined aggregate proportionate share of funding and approved rates for homecare services in effect as of the date of the enactment of this section:

      (a) As of the effective date of this section, $8.10 per hour;

      (b) As of July 1, 2003, $8.60 per hour;

      (c) As of July 1, 2004, $9.10 per hour;

      (d) As of July 1, 2005, $9.60 per hour;

      (e) As of July 1, 2006, $10.00 per hour.

   (3) Health Benefits.

      (a) Health Benefits means receipt by a covered employee of a health care benefits package for the covered employee and/or a health care benefits package for the covered employee and such employee's family and/or dependents.

      (b) The Health Benefits Supplement Rate shall be $1.50 per hour.

      (c) For homecare services provided under the Personal Care Services program, the wage and health rates above shall only apply as long as the state and federal government maintain their combined aggregate proportionate share of funding and approved rates for homecare services in effect as of the date of the enactment of this section.

      (d) In the case of city service contractors or subcontractors providing homecare services, the health benefits requirements of this section may be waived by the terms of a bona fide collective bargaining agreement with respect to employees who have never worked a minimum of eighty (80) hours per month for two consecutive months for that covered employer, but such provision may not be waived for any employees once they have achieved a minimum of eighty (80) hours for two consecutive months and no other provisions of this section may be so waived.

   (4) Exemption for Employment Programs for the Disadvantaged. The following categories of employees shall not be subject to the requirements of this section:

      (a) Any employee who is:

         (i) Under the age of eighteen who is claimed as a dependent for federal income tax purposes and is employed as an after-school or summer employee; or

         (ii) Employed as a trainee in a bona fide training program consistent with federal and state law where the training program has the goal that the employee advances into a permanent position; provided, however, that this exemption shall apply only when the trainee does not replace, displace or lower the wages or benefits of any covered employee, and the training does not exceed two years; and

      (b) Any disabled employee, where such disabled employee:

         (i) Is covered by a current sub-minimum wage certificate issued to the employer by the United States department of labor; or

         (ii) Would be covered by such a certificate but for the fact that the employer is paying a wage equal to or higher than the federal minimum wage.

   (5) Retaliation and Discrimination Barred. It shall be unlawful for any covered employer to retaliate, discharge, demote, suspend, take adverse employment action in the terms and conditions of employment or otherwise discriminate against any covered employee for reporting or asserting a violation of this section, for seeking or communicating information regarding rights conferred by this section, for exercising any other rights protected under this section, or for participating in any investigatory or court proceeding relating to this section. This protection shall also apply to any covered employee or his or her representative who in good faith alleges a violation of this section, or who seeks or communicates information regarding rights conferred by this section in circumstances where he or she in good faith believes this section applies. Taking adverse employment action against a covered employee(s) or his or her representative within sixty days of the covered employee engaging in any of the aforementioned activities shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for those activities. Any covered employee subjected to any action that violates this subsection may pursue administrative remedies or bring a civil action pursuant to subsection e of this section in a court of competent jurisdiction.

   (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to establish a wage or benefit pattern or otherwise affect the establishment of wages or benefits for city employees.

c. Obligations of Covered Employers.

   (1) A covered employer shall comply with the wage, benefits and other requirements of this section.

   (2) Certification of Compliance.

      (a) Prior to the award or renewal of a city service contract, the applicant for award or renewal shall provide to the extent permitted by law the awarding contracting agency a certification containing the following information:

         (i) The name, address, and telephone number of the chief executive officer of the applicant;

         (ii) A statement that, if the city service contract is awarded or renewed, the applicant agrees to comply with the requirements of this section, and with all applicable federal, state and local laws;

         (iii) The following workforce information concerning employees of the applicant that will be covered employees under the planned city service contract:

            (a) the absolute number of covered employees and the number of full-time equivalent covered employees;

            (b) for all categories of covered employees, the following information broken down by category:

               (1) job classifications of covered employees in each category; and

               (2) the wages and benefits provided covered employees in each category (including a description of individual and family health coverage, and sick, annual and terminal leave). The applicant further agrees to require all of its city service subcontractors to provide the same workforce information as described herein;

         (iv) To the extent permitted by law, a record of any instances during the preceding five years in which the applicant has been found by a court or government agency to have violated federal, state or local laws regulating payment of wages or benefits, labor relations or occupational safety and health, or to the extent permitted by law, in which any government body initiated a judicial action, administrative proceeding or investigation of the applicant in regard to such laws; and

         (v) An acknowledgement that a finding by a contracting agency that the applicant has violated the requirements of this section may result in the cancellation or rescission of the city service contract. The certification shall be signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the applicant, and shall be annexed to and form a part of the city service contract. The certification (including updated certifications) and the city service contract shall be public documents and the contracting agency shall make them available to the public upon request for inspection and copying pursuant to the state freedom of information law.

      (b) A city service contractor shall each year throughout the term of the city service contract submit to the contracting agency an updated certification, identifying any, if any exist, changes to the current certification.

      (c) A covered employer shall maintain original payroll records for each of its covered employees reflecting the days and hours worked on contracts, projects or assignments that are subject to the requirements of this section, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked. The covered employer shall maintain these records for the duration of the term of the city service contract and shall retain them for a period of four years after completion of the term of the city service contract. Failure to maintain such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the covered employer did not pay its covered employees the wages and benefits required under the section. Upon the request of the comptroller or the contracting agency, the covered employer shall provide a certified original payroll record.

      (d) A city service contractor providing building services, food services or temporary services shall, as required by the predecessor version of this section, continue to submit copies of such payroll records, certified by the city service contractor under penalty of perjury to be true and accurate, to the contracting agency with every requisition for payment.

      (e) A city service contractor providing homecare, day care, head start or services to persons with cerebral palsy may comply with the certification and other reporting requirements of this paragraph by submitting, as part of the contract proposal/contract and requests for payment categorical information about the wages, benefits and job classifications of covered employees of the city service contractor, and of any city service subcontractors, which shall be the substantial equivalent of the information required in clause iii of subparagraph (2)(a) of this paragraph.

   (3) A city service contractor shall ensure that its city service subcontractors comply with the requirements of this section, and shall provide written notification to its city service subcontractors of those requirements, and include in any contract or agreement with its city service subcontractors a provision requiring them to comply with those requirements.

   (4) No later than the day on which any work begins under a city service contract subject to the requirements of this section, the covered employer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every work site and provide each covered employee a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which covered employees are entitled under this section. Such notices shall be provided in english, spanish and other languages spoken by ten percent or more of a covered employer's covered employees. The comptroller shall provide contracting agencies with sample written notices explaining the rights of covered employees and covered employers' obligations under this section, and contracting agencies shall in turn provide those written notices to city service contractors, which shall in turn provide them to their subcontractors.

d. City Implementation and Reporting. 

   (1) Coordination by the Comptroller. The comptroller shall monitor, investigate, and audit the compliance by all contracting agencies, and provide covered employers and employees with the information and assistance necessary to ensure that the section is implemented.

      (a) The mayor or his or her designee shall promulgate implementing rules and regulations as appropriate and consistent with this section and may delegate such authority to the comptroller. The comptroller shall be responsible for publishing the living wage and for calculating and publishing all applicable prevailing wage and health benefits supplement rates. The comptroller shall annually publish the adjusted rates. The adjusted living wage and health benefits supplement rate shall take effect on July 1 of each year, and the adjusted prevailing wage rates shall take effect on whatever date revised prevailing wage rates determined under section 230 of the state labor law are made effective. At least 30 days prior to their effective date, the relevant contracting agencies, shall provide notice of the adjusted rates to city service contractors, which shall in turn provide written notification of the rate adjustments to each of their covered employees, and to any city service subcontractors, which shall in turn provide written notification to each of their covered employees. Covered employers shall make necessary wage and health benefits adjustments by the effective date of the adjusted rates.

      (b) The comptroller and the mayor shall ensure that the information set forth in the certifications (including annual updated certifications and alternatives to certifications authorized for city service contractors providing homecare, day care, or head start services or services to persons with cerebral palsy) required to be submitted under paragraph 2 of subdivision c of this section is integrated into and contained in the city's contracting and financial management database established pursuant to section 6-116.2 of the administrative code. Such information shall to the extent permitted by law be made available to the public. Provided, however, that the comptroller and the mayor may agree to restrict from disclosure to the public any information from the certifications required under paragraph 2 of subdivision c of this section that is of a personal nature.

      (c) The comptroller shall submit annual reports to the mayor and the city council summarizing and assessing the implementation and enforcement of this section during the preceding year, and include such information in the summary report on contracts required under section 6-116.2 of the administrative code.

   (2) Implementation by Contracting Agencies.

      (a) Contracting agencies shall comply with and enforce the requirements of this section. The requirements of this section shall be a term and condition of any city service contract. No contracting agency may expend city funds in connection with any city service contract that does not comply with the requirements of this section.

      (b) Every city service contract shall have annexed to it the following materials which shall form a part of the specifications for and terms of the city service contract:

         (i) A provision obligating the city service contractor to comply with all applicable requirements under this section;

         (ii) The certification required under paragraph 2 of subdivision c of this section;

         (iii) A schedule of the current living wage and health benefits supplement rates, a schedule of job classifications for which payment of the prevailing wage is required under this section together with the applicable prevailing wage rates for each job classification, as determined by the comptroller and notice that such rates are adjusted annually; and

         (iv) A provision providing that:

            (a) Failure to comply with the requirements of this section may constitute a material breach by the city service contractor of the terms of the city service contract;

            (b) Such failure shall be determined by the contracting agency; and

            (c) If, within thirty days after or pursuant to the terms of the city service contract, whichever is longer, the city service contractor and/or subcontractor receives written notice of such a breach, the city service contractor fails to cure such breach, the city shall have the right to pursue any rights or remedies available under the terms of the city service contract or under applicable law, including termination of the contract.

e. Monitoring, Investigation and Enforcement.

   (1) Enforcement.

      (a) Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe that a covered employer or other person has not complied with the requirements of this section, or upon a verified complaint in writing from a covered employee, a former employee, an employee's representative, a labor union with an interest in the city service contract at issue, the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the facts relating thereto. In conducting such investigation, the comptroller shall have the same investigatory, hearing, and other powers as are conferred on the comptroller by sections 234 and 235 of the state labor law. At the start of such investigation, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by section 235.2 of the state labor law, instruct or, in the case of homecare services, day care services, head start services or services to persons with cerebral palsy, advise the relevant contracting agency to withhold any payment due the covered employer in order to safeguard the rights of the covered employees. Provided, however, that in the case of city service contractors providing services to persons with cerebral palsy, day care or head start services, no such withholding of payment may be ordered until such time as the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, has issued an order, determination or other disposition finding a violation of this section and the city service contractor has failed to cure the violation in a timely fashion. Based upon such investigation, hearing, and findings, the comptroller shall report the results of such investigation and hearing to the contracting agency, who shall issue such order, determination or other disposition. Such disposition may:

         (i) Direct payment of wages and/or the monetary equivalent of benefits wrongly denied, including interest from the date of the underpayment to the worker, based on the rate of interest per year then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the state banking law, but in any event at a rate no less than six percent per year;

         (ii) Direct the filing or disclosure of any records that were not filed or made available to the public as required by this section;

         (iii) Direct the reinstatement of, or other appropriate relief for, any person found to have been subject to retaliation or discrimination in violation of this section;

         (iv) Direct payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding twenty-five percent of the total amount found to be due in violation of this section;

         (v) Direct payment of the sums withheld at the commencement of the investigation and the interest that has accrued thereon to the covered employer; and

         (vi) Declare a finding of non-responsibility and bar the covered employer from receiving city service contracts from the contracting agency for a prescribed period of time. In assessing an appropriate remedy, a contracting agency shall give due consideration to the size of the employer's business, the employer's good faith, the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and the failure to comply with record-keeping, reporting, anti-retaliation or other non-wage requirements. Any civil penalty shall be deposited in the city general revenue fund.

      (b) In circumstances where a city service contractor fails to perform in accordance with any of the requirements of this section and there is a continued need for the service, a contracting agency may obtain from another source the required service as specified in the original contract, or any part thereof, and may charge the non-performing city service contractor for any difference in price resulting from the alternative arrangements, may assess any administrative charge established by the contracting agency, and may, as appropriate, invoke such other sanctions as are available under the contract and applicable law.

      (c) Before issuing an order, determination or any other disposition, the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, shall give notice thereof together with a copy of the complaint, or a statement of the facts disclosed upon investigation, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on any person or covered employer affected thereby. The comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, may negotiate an agreed upon stipulation of settlement or refer the matter to the office of administrative trials and hearings for a hearing and disposition. Such person or covered employer shall be notified of a hearing date by the office of administrative trials and hearings and shall have the opportunity to be heard in respect to such matters.

      (d) In an investigation conducted under the provisions of this section, the inquiry of the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, shall not extend to work performed more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint, or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier.

      (e) When, pursuant to the provisions of this section, a final disposition has been entered against a covered employer in two instances within any consecutive six year period determining that such covered employer has failed to comply with the wage, benefits, anti-retaliation, record-keeping or reporting requirements of this section, such covered employer, and any principal or officer of such covered employer who knowingly participated in such failure, shall be ineligible to submit a bid on or be awarded any city service contract for a period of five years from the date of the second disposition.

      (f) When a final determination has been made in favor of a covered employee or other person and the person found violating this section has failed to comply with the payment or other terms of the remedial order of the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, and provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding shall have expired, the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, shall file a copy of such order containing the amount found to be due with the city clerk of the county of residence or place of business of the person found to have violated this section, or of any principal or officer thereof who knowingly participated in the violation of this section. The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be enforced by and in the name of the comptroller or contracting agency, as applicable, in the same manner and with like effect as that prescribed by the state civil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment.

      (g) Before any further payment is made, or claim is permitted, of any sums or benefits due under any city service contract covered by this section, it shall be the duty of the contracting agency to require the covered employer, including each city service subcontractor of the covered employer, that has been found to have violated the law, to file a written statement certifying to the amounts then due and owing from each such covered employer to or on behalf of all covered employees, or the city for wages or benefits wrongly denied them, or for civil penalties assessed, and setting forth the names of the persons owed and the amount due to or on behalf of each respectively. This statement shall be verified as true and accurate by the covered employer under penalty of perjury. If any interested person shall have previously filed a protest in writing objecting to the payment to any covered employer on the ground that payment is owing to one or more employees of the covered employer for violations of this section, or if for any other reason it may be deemed advisable, the comptroller, a contracting agency or the city department of finance may deduct from the whole amount of any payment to the covered employer sums admitted by the covered employer in the verified statement or statements to be due and owing to any covered employee before making payment of the amount certified for payment, and may withhold the amount so deducted for the benefit of the employees or persons that are owed payment as shown by the verified statements and may pay directly to any person the amount shown by the statements to be due them.

      (h) The comptroller or any contracting agency shall be authorized to contract with non-governmental agencies to investigate possible violations of this section. Where a covered employer is found to have violated the requirements of this section, the covered employer shall be liable to the city for costs incurred in investigating and prosecuting the violation.

   (2) Enforcement by Private Right of Action.

      (a) When a final determination has been made and such determination is in favor of a covered employee, such covered employee may, in addition to any other remedy provided by this section, institute an action in any court of appropriate jurisdiction against the covered employer found to have violated this section. For any violation of this section, including failure to pay applicable wages, provide required benefits, or comply with other requirements of this section, including protections against retaliation and discrimination, the court may award any appropriate remedy at law or equity including, but not limited to, back pay, payment for wrongly denied benefits, interest, other equitable or make-whole relief, reinstatement, injunctive relief and/or compensatory damages. The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to any complaining party who prevails in any such enforcement action.

      (b) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section or of any other general, special or local law, ordinance, city charter or administrative code, an employee affected by this law shall not be barred from the right to recover the difference between the amount paid to the employee and the amount which should have been paid to the employee under the provisions of this section because of the prior receipt by the employee without protest of wages or benefits paid, or on account of the employee's failure to state orally or in writing upon any payroll or receipt which the employee is required to sign that the wages or benefits received by the employee are received under protest, or on account of the employee's failure to indicate a protest against the amount, or that the amount so paid does not constitute payment in full of wages or benefits due the employee for the period covered by such payment.

      (c) Such action must be commenced within three years of the date of the alleged violation, or within three years of the final disposition of any administrative complaint or action concerning the alleged violation or, if such a disposition is reviewed in a proceeding pursuant to article 78 of the state civil practice law and rules, within three years of the termination of such review proceedings. No procedure or remedy set forth in this section is intended to be exclusive or a prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights hereunder in a court of law. This section shall not be construed to limit an employee's right to bring a common law cause of action for wrongful termination.

f. Other provisions.

   (1) Except where expressly provided otherwise in this section, the requirements of this section shall apply to city service contracts entered into after the effective date of this section, and shall not apply to any existing city service contract entered into prior to that date. Where a city service contract is renewed or extended after the effective date of this section, such renewal or extension shall be deemed new city service contracts and shall trigger coverage under this section if the terms of the renewed or extended city service contract, otherwise meet the requirements for coverage under this section. However, city service contractors and city service subcontractors that provide services to persons with cerebral palsy, day care services or head start services shall be subject to the requirements of this section only upon the award or renewal of city service contracts after the effective date of this section. City service contractors and city service subcontractors that provide homecare services shall be subject to the requirements of this section immediately upon the effective date of this section.

   (2) Members of the public shall have a right of access to documents or information that is designated as public under article six of the public officers law. Such public documents or information as pursuant to the law shall be made available to the public for inspection and copying. The custodians of such documents or information may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed twenty-five cents per page, for copying.

   (3) Contracting agencies shall begin requiring city service contractors to supplement the information currently required to be submitted pursuant to section 6-116.2 of the administrative code with the additional information specified in clause iii of subparagraph a of paragraph 2 of subdivision c of this section. This information shall be compiled by the contracting agency and included in the computerized database jointly maintained by the mayor and the comptroller pursuant to section 6-116.2 of the administrative code.

   (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or conflicting with any other obligation or law, including any collective bargaining agreement, that mandates the provision of higher or superior wages, benefits, or protections to covered employees. No requirement or provision of this section shall be construed as applying to any person or circumstance where such coverage would be preempted by federal or state law. However, in such circumstances, only those specific applications or provisions of this section for which coverage would be preempted shall be construed as not applying.

   (5) In the event that any requirement or provision of this section, or its application to any person or circumstance, should be held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other requirements or provisions of this section, or the application of the requirement or provision held invalid to any other person or circumstance.

l. The requirements of this section shall be waived in writing under the following circumstances:

   (1) there is only one prospective contractor willing to enter into a contract, where it is determined that all bidders to a contract are deemed ineligible for purposes of this section; or

   (2) where it is available from a sole source and the prospective contractor is not currently disqualified from doing business with the city; or

   (3) the contract is necessary in order to respond to an emergency which endangers the public health and safety and no entity which complies with the requirements of this section capable of responding to the emergency is immediately available; or

         (ii) if the contractor is a religious or denominational institution or organization, or an organization operated for charitable or educational purposes which is operated, supervised or controlled by or in connection with a religious organization, and the certification required in subsection c(1)(a)(i) of this section would, in the opinion of such contractor, be inconsistent with the religious principles for which such organization was established or maintained, it offers household member coverage to its employees, provided that such employees shall not be required to disclose to the contractor information concerning the nature of their relationship with a designated household member beyond that which such contractor deems necessary to determine eligibility for household member coverage; and

If during the term of a covered contract a contractor fails to provide equal benefits as required pursuant to this section, or if a contractor retaliates against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment for requesting equal benefits or for informing the city that such contractor has failed to provide equal benefits, such failure and/or retaliation shall be deemed a material breach of such contract. Upon receiving information that a contractor has failed to provide equal benefits as required pursuant to this section and/or retaliated against an employee in violation of this section, the implementing agency shall review such information, notify the contractor of such information and offer the contractor an opportunity to respond. If it is found that a violation has occurred, the implementing agency shall take such action as may be appropriate and provided by law, rule or contract, including, but not limited to, imposing sanctions, seeking compliance, recovering damages, declaring the contractor in default and/or seeking a finding that the contractor is not a responsible contractor pursuant to section 335 of the charter. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the remedies a contractor's employee or the domestic partner of such employee may seek in law or equity in the event of such contractor's non-compliance.

k. (1) The requirements of this section may be waived by the implementing agency upon application by a contracting agency under the following circumstances:

      (i) for sole source contracts entered into pursuant to section 321 of the charter, where the sole source is unwilling to comply with the requirements of this section; or

      (ii) for emergency contracts entered into pursuant to section 315 of the charter and for which no entity which complies with the requirements of this section and which is capable of fulfilling such contract is immediately available; or

      (iii) where compliance with the requirements of this section would violate or be inconsistent with the terms or conditions of a grant, subvention or contract with a public agency or the instructions of an authorized representative of any such agency with respect to any such grant, subvention or contract; or

      (iv) where there are no prospective bidders for a contract that are willing to comply with the requirements of this section and it is essential for the city to enter into such contract.

   (2) All applications for waivers pursuant to this subdivision shall be made in writing. The implementing agency shall, within a reasonable period of time, determine whether to grant such waiver applications. All decisions regarding waivers shall be issued in writing and shall include the reason for the granting or denial of such application. All decisions granting waivers shall become part of the relevant contract file.

   (3) Beginning twelve months after the effective date of the local law that added this section and annually thereafter, the implementing agency shall report to the council regarding the twelve month period immediately preceding the report, the number and total dollar value of waivers for which it received applications disaggregated by type of waiver and contracting agency; the number and total dollar value of waivers granted disaggregated by type of waiver and contracting agency; and the number and total dollar value of waivers denied or withdrawn disaggregated by type of waiver and contracting agency.

l. The requirements of this section shall not apply to contracts relating to the investment of assets held in trust by the city or to the investment of city monies.

m. The comptroller shall conduct annual investigations, on a sample basis, to measure contractor compliance with the requirements of this section. Contractors shall make such information available as is necessary to conduct such investigations. Beginning twelve months after the effective date of the local law that added this section and annually thereafter, the comptroller shall report the results of such investigations to the mayor and the council.

n. A contractor may institute an internal registry to allow for the provision of equal benefits to employees with domestic partners who are not domestic partners as defined in section 3-240(a) of the administrative code, or who are located in a jurisdiction where no such governmental domestic partnership registry exists; provided, however, that a contractor that institutes such a registry shall not impose criteria for registration that are more stringent than those required for domestic partnership registration by the city of New York. A contractor may also verify the existence of a domestic partnership or marriage to the extent such verification is undertaken equally for employees with domestic partners and employees with spouses.

o. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the city's authority to cancel or terminate a contract, deny or withdraw approval to perform a subcontract or provide supplies, issue a non-responsibility finding, issue a non-responsiveness finding, deny a person or entity pre-qualification, or to otherwise deny a person or entity city business.

p. This section shall only apply to contracts entered into or renewed on or after the effective date of the local law that added this section.

q. The procurement policy board may promulgate rules to implement the requirements of this section.

      (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph a of this definition, any lender shall not be a predatory lender if:

         (i) the lender obtains the approval of the comptroller of the city of New York for a plan to discontinue the practice of making, purchasing or otherwise investing in predatory loans by the lender and its affiliates, and the lender and its affiliates then completely cease making, purchasing or otherwise investing in predatory loans within 60 days after the plan is approved by the comptroller; and

         (ii) the lender and its affiliates remain in compliance with such plan; provided that no more than one plan may be submitted to the comptroller on behalf of any lender, except a subsequent plan may be submitted to the comptroller:

            (A) if ten or more years have passed since the same lender submitted a prior plan pursuant to this section; or

            (B) by a person solely in connection with the acquisition of a predatory lender after the date of submission of a prior plan if such plan will discontinue the practice of making, purchasing or otherwise investing in predatory loans by the acquired predatory lender within 90 days of such acquisition; or

         (iii) when directly or indirectly purchasing or investing in high-cost home loans, or arranging for the purchase or investment in high-cost home loans by collective investment or securitization, the lender reasonably believes, after reasonable investigation, conducted by or on behalf of such lender, based upon reasonable procedures consistent with industry practice for the review of the terms and other characteristics of home loans in connection with the purchase or securitization of, or investment in, high-cost home loans generally, that the home loans purchased or invested in do not constitute predatory loans as defined by this section. For purposes of this clause iii, "procedures consistent with industry practice" shall include, but not be limited to, a random statistical sample of not less than ten percent of the home loans for real property located in the city of New York included in the home loan pool to be securitized or purchased, except that if the lender has an established business relationship with the originator or wholesaler of the home loans being purchased or securitized, as demonstrated by the lender having completed not less than four transactions with said entity during the preceding two years, the lender may conuct a random statistical sample of not less than five percent of the home loans described above. Furthermore, for purposes of this clause, the lender may rely on a complete Compliance Worksheet, as defined in this section, to establish a reasonable belief that a high-cost home loan is not a predatory loan as defined in subparagraphs a, b, d (only with respect to the lender or an affiliate not having advised or recommended that the borrower obtain a waiver of home loan counseling), o, p and q of paragraph 16 of this subdivision; or

         (iv) the lender is an exempt organization qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code, and operates to remediate predatory loans with the approval of, or in association with, a city, state or federal agency.

   (16) "Predatory Loan" means any high-cost home loan with one or more of the following characteristics:

      (a) Proceeds of the high-cost home loan are used to pay all or part of an existing home loan and the borrower does not receive a reasonable and tangible benefit from the new home loan considering all the circumstances, including the terms of both the new and existing home loan and any other debt being refinanced by the new loan, the cost of the new home loan, and the borrower's circumstances. For purposes of this subparagraph, there shall be a presumption that the borrower has received a reasonable and tangible benefit if, at the time the refinance loan is made, any of the following is true:

         (i) as a result of the refinance there is a net reduction in the borrower's total monthly payments on all debts consolidated into the new home loan, and this reduction will continue for at least thirty-six months after the refinance;

         (ii) as a result of the refinance there is a reduction in the borrower's blended interest rate on all debts consolidated into the new home loan, and it will not take more than five years for the borrower to recoup the points and fees charged for the refinance; or

         (iii) the refinance loan is necessary to prevent default under an existing home loan or other secured debt of the borrower, provided that the lender for the refinanced loan is not the same as or an affiliate of the lender for the existing home loan or other secured debt.

      (b) The lender does not reasonably believe at the time it makes the high-cost home loan that the borrower will be able to make the scheduled payments, based upon a consideration of the borrower's current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources (other than equity in the home being financed). There shall be a presumption that the borrower is able to make the scheduled payments if, at the time the loan is made:

         (i) the scheduled monthly payments (after giving effect to any index adjustments with respect to the loan) on the loan (including principal, interest, taxes, insurance, assessments, condominium fees, cooperative maintenance expenses) combined with the scheduled payments for all other debt, do not exceed fifty percent of the borrower's documented and verified monthly gross income; and

         (ii) the borrower has sufficient residual income as defined in the guidelines established in 38 CFR § 36.4337(e) and United States department of veteran administration form 26-6393 to pay essential monthly expenses after paying the scheduled monthly payments and any additional debt; or

         (iii) if clauses (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph do not apply, the home loan shall be a predatory loan unless the lender determines and documents prior to the closing of the loan that the making of the loan is justified based upon specific compensating factors, such as the borrower's long-term credit history, the borrower's demonstrated ability to make payments under comparable or greater debt obligations to income ratios, the conservative use of credit standards, the borrower's significant liquid assets or other reasonable factors.

      (c) The lender finances points and fees, as defined in paragraph 14 of subdivision a of this section, in an amount that exceeds four percent of the total loan amount for a closed-end high-cost home loan or four percent of the maximum line of credit amount for an open-end line of credit.

      (d) Prior to making the high-cost home loan, the lender does not receive a written certification from an independent housing or credit counselor, approved by the United States department of housing and urban development, that the borrower received counseling on the advisability of the loan transaction and the appropriateness of the loan for the borrower, or waived the loan counseling. Provided that a borrower may waive the loan counseling required pursuant to this subparagraph only by contacting such an independent housing or credit counselor by personal meeting or live telephone conversation at least three days prior to the closing of the home loan and certifying in a notarized written statement to the counselor that he or she has elected to waive the loan counseling, and no such waiver shall be valid if the lender or any of its affiliates has recommended or advised the borrower to make such waiver.

      (e) More than two periodic payments required under the high-cost home loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds provided to the borrower other than a loan issued by or guaranteed by an instrumentality of the United States or of any state or any city agency, such as loan products offered by the United States department of veterans administration, fair housing administration or state of New York mortgage agency.

      (f) Default by the borrower triggers an interest rate increase. This provision does not apply to periodic interest rate changes in a variable rate loan otherwise consistent with the provisions of the loan agreement, provided the change in the interest rate is not occasioned by the event of a default or the acceleration of the indebtedness.

      (g) The lender, at its sole discretion, may accelerate the indebtedness and demand repayment of the entire outstanding balance of a high-cost home loan. This prohibition does not apply when repayment of the loan has been accelerated by bona fide default, pursuant to a due-on-sale provision, or pursuant to some other provision of the loan agreement unrelated to the payment schedule, such as bankruptcy or receivership.

      (h) The payment schedule for the high-cost home loan requires regular periodic payments that cause the principal balance to increase, except as a result of a temporary forbearance sought by the borrower.

      (i) There is a required scheduled payment that is twice as large as the average of the earlier scheduled payments, unless such increases are justified by a reamortization as a result of a new withdrawal in an open-ended line of credit. This provision does not apply:

         (i) when the payment schedule is adjusted to the seasonal or irregular income of the borrower; or

         (ii) if the purpose of the loan is a construction bridge loan connected with the construction of a dwelling intended to become the borrower's principal residence.

      (j) The loan agreement imposes a penalty or fee on the borrower in violation of section 5-501(3)(b) of the general obligations law or section 393(2) of the banking law for paying the balance of the loan, in whole or in part.

      (k) The loan agreement contains a mandatory arbitration clause that is oppressive, unfair, unconscionable, or substantially in derogation of the rights of the borrower.

      (l) Any of the proceeds of the high-cost home loan are paid to either a home improvement contractor that is an affiliate of the lender or any home improvement contractor other than:

         (i) by an instrument payable solely to the borrower; or

         (ii) at the election of the borrower, through a third-party escrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed by the borrower, the lender and the contractor prior to the disbursement.

      (m) The high-cost home loan finances any credit life, credit disability, credit property, credit unemployment, health or life linsurance, or proceeds of the loan are used to make payments pursuant to debt cancellation or suspension agreements. Insurance premiums calculated and paid on a monthly basis shall not be considered financed by the home loan.

      (n) The borrower is charged any fees or other charges to modify, renew, extend or amend a high-cost home loan or to defer any payment due under the terms of the loan if, after the modification, renewal, extension or amendment, the loan is still a high-cost home loan or, if no longer a high-cost home loan, the annual percentage rate has not been decreased by at least two percentage points. For purposes of this subparagraph, fees shall not include interest that is otherwise payable and consistent with the provisions of the loan documents. This subparagraph shall not apply to a home loan where the lender is charging points and fees in connection with any additional proceeds received by the borrower in connection with the modification, renewal, extension or amendment (over and above the current principal balance of the existing high-cost home loan) provided that the points and fees charged on the additional sum must reflect the lender's typical point and fee structure for high-cost home loans.

      (o) The high-cost home loan refinances an existing home loan that is a special mortgage originated, subsidized or guaranteed by or through a state, tribal or local government, or nonprofit organization, which bears either a below-market interest rate at the time of origination, or has nonstandard payment terms beneficial to the borrower, such as payments that vary with income, are limited to a percentage of income, or where no payments are required under specified conditions, and where, as a result of the refinancing, the borrower would lose one or more of the benefits of the special mortgage, unless the lender is provided prior to the loan closing documentation by an independent housing or credit counselor, approved by the United States department of housing and urban development, or the lender who originally made the special mortgage, that a borrower has received home loan counseling on the advantages and disadvantages of the refinancing. There shall be no waiver of the home loan counseling requirement of this subparagraph.

      (p) The lender charges points and fees on a high-cost home loan that refinances a prior high-cost home loan extended by the same lender or an affiliate of the lender and the refinancing occurs within five years of the extension of the prior home loan.

      (q) The home loan is secured as a result of fraudulent or deceptive marketing or sales efforts.

      (r) The home loan violates any applicable provision of the federal truth in lending act, as amended by the home ownership and equity protection act of 1994 (15 U.S.C. § 1601, et seq.), the federal real estate settlement procedures act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. § 2601, et seq.), or any regulations implementing these statutes, or the restrictions and limitations on high-cost home loans in the general regulations of the New York state banking board (3 NYCRR Part 41), as these statutes and these regulations may be amended from time to time.

b. City Financial Assistance.

   (1) No city agency shall approve, grant, award, pay, distribute or issue any city financial assistance to a financial institution where the financial institution or an affiliate of the financial institution is a predatory lender as defined by this section.

   (2) As a condition to receiving any form of financial assistance from a city agency, a financial institution shall provide a statement to the city agency certifying that neither the financial institution nor any of its affiliates is or will become a predatory lender. The statement shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the institution, or the designee of any such person, and shall be made a part of the award, grant or assistance agreement. A violation of any provision of the certified statement shall constitute a material violation of the conditions of the award, grant or assistance agreement.

   (3) After the approval or issuance of an award, grant, or any other financial assistance, the comptroller may conduct an investigation pursuant to subdivision f of this section to determine whether a financial institution or any of its affiliates is a predatory lender as defined by this section. Upon determining that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender, and where no cure is effected or corrective plan filed pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section and approved by the comptroller, the comptroller shall provide evidence to the city agency that approved or issued the financial assistance that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender and request in writing that the city agency take the appropriate actions to rescind or otherwise void the award, grant or assistance. Upon receipt of the comptroller's request, the city agency shall then make a finding whether or not the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender in violation of this section. Upon making a finding of violation, the city agency shall take such action as may be appropriate and provided for by law, rule or contract, including, but not limited to: declaring the financial institution in default of the award, grant or financial assistance agreement; imposing sanctions; recovering the funds advanced; or requiring repayment of any taxes or interest abated or deferred. Within sixty days of receiving notification from the comptroller, the city agency shall place a written explanation in the financial institution's file regarding any action the city agency has taken pursuant to this section, or the reasons no action was taken. Copies of the written explanation shall be immediately forwarded to the comptroller and to the city council. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a city agency, in the absence of a request from the comptroller, from investigating and making a determination whether or not a financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender in violation of this section.

   (4) For the purposes of this section, city financial assistance shall include, but not be limited to, tax abatements (including, but not limited to, abatements of property, sales or mortgage recording taxes), cash payments or grants.

   (5) Nothing in this section shall operate to impair any contract or agreement regarding financial assistance in effect on the date this section takes effect, except that renewal, amendment or modification of such contract or agreement occurring on or after the enactment of this section shall be subject to all conditions specified in this section.

   (6) Notwithstanding any city laws, rules or regulations to the contrary, any financial institution or its affiliate that has been found by a city agency to be a predatory lender shall be prohibited from applying for or receiving any city financial assistance from any city agency for a period of three years from the date of the last disbursement or approval of an award, grant or other financial assistance, or from the date of the finding, whichever is later.

c. City Contracts.

   (1) No city agency shall enter into a contract for goods or services with a financial institution or an affiliate of a financial institution where either the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender as defined by this section.

   (2) As a condition of contracting with a city agency, the financial institution or its affiliate shall provide a statement to the city agency certifying that neither the financial institution nor any of its affiliates is or will become a predatory lender. The statement shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the institution or affiliate, or the designee of any such person, and shall be made a part of the contract or agreement. A violation of any provision of the certified statement shall constitute a material breach of the contract.

   (3) During the period of a city contract, the comptroller may conduct an investigation pursuant to subdivision f of this section to determine whether a financial institution or one of its affiliates is a predatory lender as defined by this section. Upon determining that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender, and where no cure is effected or corrective plan filed pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section and approved by the comptroller, the comptroller shall provide evidence to the city agency that issued the contract that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender and request in writing that the city agency take the appropriate actions to rescind or otherwise void the contract. Upon receipt of the comptroller's request, the city agency that issued the contract shall then make a finding whether or not the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender in violation of this section. Upon making a finding of violation, the city agency shall take such action as may be appropriate and provided for by law, rule or contract, including, but not limited to: declaring the financial institution or the affiliate in default; arranging for the alternate procurement of the goods or services to which such contract relates in such manner as to prevent any loss to the city agency that otherwise might result from the immediate cessation of the contract; imposing sanctions; or recovering damages. Within sixty days of receiving notification from the comptroller, the city agency shall place a written explanation in the financial institution's or affiliate's contract file regarding any action the city agency has taken pursuant to this section, or the reasons no action was taken. Copies of the written explanation shall be immediately forwarded to the comptroller and to the city council. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude a city agency, in the absence of a request from the comptroller, from investigating and making a determination whether or not a financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender in violation of this section.

   (4) This subdivision shall not apply to any contract evidencing or establishing the terms of any debt obligations issued by or on behalf of the city agency, but shall apply to contracts with respect to agency, underwriting and other services provided in connection with any issuance thereof.

   (5) Nothing in this section shall operate to impair any contract in effect on the date this section takes effect, except that renewal, amendment or modification of such contract occurring on or after the enactment of this section shall be subject to all conditions specified in this section.

   (6) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority to cancel or terminate a contract, deny or withdraw approval to perform a subcontract or provide supplies, issue a non-responsibility finding, issue a non-responsiveness finding, deny a person or entity pre-qualification, or otherwise deny a person or entity city business.

   (7) Notwithstanding any city laws, rules or regulations to the contrary, any financial institution or affiliate that has been found by a city agency to be a predatory lender shall be prohibited from contracting with any city agency for a period of three years from the termination date of the contract or the date of the finding, whichever is later.

d. Deposits.

   (1) A financial institution that is a predatory lender as defined by this section, or that has affiliates that are predatory lenders, shall not be a depository for the funds of any city agency.

   (2) As a condition for being a depository of city agency funds, the financial institution shall provide a statement to the city banking commission certifying that neither the financial institution nor any of its affiliates is or will become a predatory lender. The statement shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the institution, or the designee of any such person, and shall constitute a material provision of the deposit contract or agreement.

   (3) The comptroller shall have the authority to investigate a financial institution that is a depository for city funds or its affiliates pursuant to subdivision f of this section to determine whether the financial institution or any of its affiliates is a predatory lender as defined by this section. Upon determining that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender, and where no cure is effected or corrective plan filed pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph three of subdivision f of this section and approved by the comptroller, the comptroller shall provide evidence to the banking commission that the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender and request that the banking commission revoke the designation of the financial institution as a depository pursuant to section 1524 of the city charter. The banking commission shall then make a finding whether the financial institution or its affiliate is a predatory lender pursuant to this section and is in violation of its certification pursuant to section 1524(2)(a)(4) of the city charter. Upon making a finding of violation, the banking commission shall take appropriate action to revoke the financial institution's or affiliate's designation as a depository of the funds of any city agency.

e. Investments.

   (1) The comptroller may, in his or her discretion, recommend that city moneys or funds not be invested or permitted to remain invested in the stocks, securities or other obligations of any financial institution that is a predatory lender or of an affiliate of a predatory lender.

   (2) The comptroller, when investing city funds in a financial institution or an affiliate of the financial institution, may consider the institution or affiliate's compliance with federal, state and local laws or regulations governing predatory lending. The comptroller, in his or her discretion and in accordance with his or her sound investment judgment, may remove investments with financial institutions or their affiliates that fail to comply with such federal, state or local laws or regulation. Provided that in cases where the comptroller decides, in the exercise of his or her discretion and sound investment judgment, not to remove investments in a financial institution or its affiliate that is a predatory lender as defined by this section, the comptroller shall immediately place a written explanation in the financial institution or affiliate's file regarding the reasons for his or her decision not to remove the investments, and forward a copy of the written explanation to the city council.

f. Enforcement.

   (1) The comptroller shall have the authority to investigate whether financial institutions or their affiliates are predatory lenders as defined in this section.

   (2) Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe that a financial institution or its affiliate has violated any provisions of this section, or upon a verified complaint in writing by an aggrieved borrower, the comptroller may conduct an investigation to determine whether a violation has occurred. The verified complaint shall, at a minimum, describe the violation and contain a release signed by the borrower authorizing the comptroller to obtain or otherwise gain access to all loan documents pertaining to the complaint and to any other records, files or information deemed necessary by the comptroller to conduct the investigation. An investigation by the comptroller may include, but is not limited to, reviewing information from regulatory or oversight agencies regarding lending or other activities of a financial institution as it relates to high-cost home loans, and investigating verified complaints from borrowers that a financial institution has engaged in predatory lending practices.

   (3) (a) Upon the commencement of an investigation, the comptroller shall notify the financial institution or affiliate in writing, and allow the financial institution or affiliate an opportunity to respond. If the financial institution or affiliate denies the allegations or fails to respond within thirty days of the receipt of written notice, the comptroller shall determine whether the financial institution has violated the provisions of this section.

      (b) If the financial institution or affiliate has been found to have violated the provisions of this section, the financial institution or affiliate shall have thirty days to cure the violation or to submit to the comptroller for his or her approval a corrective plan to discontinue the predatory lending practices according to clauses i and ii of subparagraph b of paragraph fifteen of subdivision a of this section. Upon good cause shown, the comptroller may extend the initial thirty-day period up to an additional thirty days.

      (c) If the financial institution or affiliate fails to cure the violation within the thirty days or to submit and obtain the comptroller's approval for a corrective plan pursuant to this section, the comptroller shall inform the appropriate city agency or the banking commission, as applicable, and request that it take action pursuant to either paragraph 3 of subdivision b, paragraph 3 of subdivision c, or paragraph 3 of subdivision d of this section. Until the comptroller gives notice to the applicable city agency or banking commission pursuant to this subparagraph, the comptroller shall hold confidential any information he receives, gathers, produces, collects or generates as a result of any investigation pursuant to this section. However, nothing herein shall restrict the comptroller from exchanging information with government agencies in the furtherance of an investigation pursuant to this section.

   (4) Any person found to have made a false statement in a certification required under this section shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of not less than $25,000 in addition to the other remedies that the city agency may have under this local law.

      (b) Agencies shall develop agency utilization plans pursuant to subdivision g of this section. The citywide goals shall not be summarily adopted as goals for all annual agency utilization plans; rather, goals for such plans may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals, subject to the approval of the commissioner as described in paragraph three of subdivision g of this section. When setting its goals, each agency shall consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year. Agencies shall seek to ensure substantial progress toward the attainment of each of these goals in as short a time as practicable.

   (3) The citywide goals shall not be summarily adopted as goals for individual procurements; rather, as set forth in subdivision i of this section, goals for such procurements may be set at levels higher, lower, or the same as the citywide goals. In setting such goals, each agency shall take into account the citywide goals and the agency's annual utilization plan, the size and nature of the procurement, and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work involved in its procurements.

   (4) (a) No later than 2015, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall, for each industry classification and each minority group, review and compare the availability rates of firms owned by minorities and women to the utilization rates of such firms in agency contracts and direct subcontracts, and shall on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this subdivision. In making such revision, the commissioner shall consider the extent to which discrimination continues to have an impact on the ability of minorities and women to compete for city contracts and subcontracts. The commissioner shall submit the results of such review and any proposed revisions to the participation goals to the speaker of the council at least sixty days prior to publishing a proposed rule that would revise participation goals. Such review shall thereafter be conducted at least once every two years.

      (b) No later than 2015, the commissioner shall review information collected by the department to determine the availability and utilization of EBEs, and shall on the basis of such review and any other relevant information, where appropriate, revise by rule the citywide participation goals set forth in this subdivision. Such revised goals shall be set at a level intended to assist in overcoming the impact of discrimination on such businesses. Such review shall be conducted in 2015 and at least once every two years thereafter.

e. Responsibilities of the division.

   (1) The division shall create and maintain and periodically update directories by industry classification of MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs which it shall supply to all agencies, post on its website and on other relevant city websites and make available for dissemination and/or public inspection at its offices and other locations within each borough.

The division shall further develop a clearinghouse of information on programs and services available to MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs. The division shall conduct meetings with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to discuss what agencies look for in evaluating bids and proposals. The division shall also educate prime contractors on opportunities to partner or subcontract with certified MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (7) The division shall develop standardized forms and reporting documents for agencies and contractors to facilitate the reporting requirements of this section.

   (8) The division shall direct and assist agencies in their efforts to increase participation by MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs in any city-operated financial, technical, and management assistance program.

   (9) The division shall study and recommend to the commissioner methods to streamline the M/WBE and EBE certification process.

   (10) Each fiscal year the division, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall audit at least 5% of all open contracts for which contractor utilization plans have been established in accordance with subdivision i of this section and 5% of all contracts awarded to MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs to assess compliance with this section. All solicitations for contracts for which contractor utilization plans are to be established shall include notice of potential audit.

   (11) The division shall assist agencies in identifying and seeking ways to reduce or eliminate practices such as bonding requirements or delays in payment by prime contractors that may present barriers to competition by MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs.

   (12) The division shall encourage prime contractors to enter joint venture agreements with MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

   (13) (a) The division shall, upon reviewing applications for certification and recertification, determine whether a firm qualifies as a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE.

      (c) At any time more than two years after the division has determined that a firm qualifies as a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE, the firm may apply to have such designation lifted. The division shall lift the designation if the firm demonstrates that it has been below the size standards established by the United States small business administration for its industry for a period of two years or more.

   (14) The division, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall conduct, coordinate and facilitate mandatory trainings for agency chief contracting officers and agency M/WBE officers to assist such officers in pursuing the objectives of this section. Each agency chief contracting officer shall undergo such training on or before the ninetieth day after he or she becomes an agency chief contracting officer, and every two years thereafter. Each agency M/WBE officer shall undergo such training on or before the ninetieth day after he or she becomes an agency M/WBE officer pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, and every two years thereafter.

The city chief procurement officer will report to the speaker of the council on an annual basis, and shall post on the City’s website, information regarding each agency’s compliance with this paragraph.

   (15) The city shall include on its website a list of city agencies, with the contact information for the M/WBE officer of each city agency and information about whether the agency’s staff have been trained as required by paragraph 14 of this subdivision.

f. Responsibilities of agency M/WBE officers. Each agency head shall designate a deputy commissioner or other executive officer to act as the agency M/WBE officer who shall be directly accountable to the agency head concerning the activities of the agency in carrying out its responsibilities pursuant to this section, including the responsibilities relating to EBE participation. The duties of the M/WBE officer shall include, but not be limited to:

   (1) creating the agency's utilization plan in accordance with subdivision g of this section;

   (2) acting as the agency's liaison with the division;

   (3) acting as a liaison with organizations and/or associations of MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs, informing such organizations and/or associations of the agency's procurement procedures, and advising them of future procurement opportunities;

   (4) ensuring that agency bid solicitations and requests for proposals are sent to MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs in a timely manner, consistent with this section and rules of the procurement policy board;

   (5) referring MBEs, WBEs, and EBEs to technical assistance services available from agencies and other organizations;

   (6) reviewing requests for waivers and/or modifications of participation goals and contractor utilization plans in accordance with paragraphs 11 and/or 12 of subdivision i of this section;

   (7) working with the division and city chief procurement officer in creating directories as required pursuant to subdivision k of this section. In fulfilling this duty, the agency M/WBE officer shall track and record each contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE and each subcontractor hired pursuant to such officer's agency contracts that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, and shall share such information with the director, the commissioner, and the city chief procurement officer;

   (8) for contracts for which contractor utilization plans have been established pursuant to subdivision i of this section, monitoring each contractor's compliance with its utilization plan by appropriate means, which shall include, but need not be limited to, job site inspections, contacting MBEs, WBEs and EBEs identified in the plan to confirm their participation, and auditing the contractor's books and records;

   (9) monitoring the agency's procurement activities to ensure compliance with its agency utilization plan and progress towards the participation goals as established in such plan;

   (10) providing to the city chief procurement officer information for the reports required in subdivision l of this section and providing any other plans and/or reports required pursuant to this section or requested by the director and/or the city chief procurement officer; and

   (11) participating in meetings required pursuant to subdivision m of this section.

g. Agency utilization plans.

   (1) Beginning May 15, 2006, and on July 31 of each year thereafter, each agency which, during the fiscal year which ended on June 30 of the preceding fiscal year, has made procurements in excess of five million dollars, without counting procurements that are exempt pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision q of this section, shall submit an agency utilization plan for the fiscal year commencing in July of the year when such plan is to be submitted to the commissioner. Upon approval by the commissioner such plan shall be submitted to the speaker of the council, and shall be published on the City’s website. Each such plan shall, at a minimum, include the following:

      (a) the agency's participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs for the year, provided however, that when setting its goals, each agency shall consider the citywide goals, the size and nature of its own procurement portfolio (excluding contracts described in paragraph two of subdivision q of this section), and the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs with the capacity to perform the specific types and scale of work for which the agency anticipates it will solicit procurements during the year;

      (b) an explanation for any agency goal that is different than the participation goal for the relevant group and industry classification as determined pursuant to subdivision d of this section;

      (c) a list of the names and titles of agency personnel responsible for implementation of the agency utilization plan;

      (d) methods and relevant activities proposed for achieving the agency's participation goals; and

      (e) any other information which the agency or the commissioner deems relevant or necessary.

   (2) An agency utilization plan shall set forth specific participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for purchases of professional services, standard services, construction and goods. When setting its goals for such purchases, in addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, each agency shall specifically consider the potential for such purchases to provide opportunities for MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to develop greater capacity, thereby increasing competition for city procurements.

   (3) An agency utilization plan may be amended from time to time to reflect changes in the agency's projected expenditures or other relevant circumstances and resulting changes in such agency's participation goals. Such amendments shall be submitted to the commissioner, the city chief procurement officer and the speaker of the council at least thirty days prior to implementation.

   (4) Prior to approving individual agency utilization plans, the commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall consider whether such plans viewed in the aggregate establish any goals exceeding the corresponding citywide goals set forth in subdivision d of this section. If any aggregated goals are found to exceed the corresponding citywide goal, the commissioner shall require agencies to adjust their goals so that plans, viewed in the aggregate, do not establish goals exceeding the citywide goals. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to limit the awards of contracts and subcontracts that may be made to MBEs, WBEs and EBEs without using goals.

   (5) The commissioner, in consultation with the city chief procurement officer, shall, no later than June 30 of each year, publish on the division's website a plan and schedule for each agency detailing the anticipated contracting actions for the upcoming fiscal year that form the basis for the agency utilization plan of each such agency. The plan and schedule shall include information specific to each prospective invitation for bids, request for proposal, or other solicitation, including, but not limited to, the specific type and scale of the services and/or goods to be procured, the term of the proposed contract, the method of solicitation the agency intends to utilize, and the anticipated fiscal year quarter of the planned solicitation.

h. Achieving agency participation goals.

   (1) Each agency head shall be directly accountable for the goals set forth in his or her agency's utilization plan.

   (2) Each agency shall make all reasonable efforts to meet the participation goals established in its agency utilization plan. Agencies shall, at a minimum, use the following methods to achieve participation goals:

      (a) Agencies shall engage in outreach activities to encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to compete for all facets of their procurement activities, including contracts awarded by negotiated acquisition, emergency and sole source contracts, and each agency shall seek to utilize MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs for all types of goods, services and construction they procure.

      (b) Agencies shall encourage eligible businesses to apply for certification as MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and inclusion in the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs. Agencies shall also encourage MBEs, WBEs and EBEs to have their names included on their bidders lists, seek pre-qualification where applicable, and compete for city business as contractors and subcontractors. Agencies are encouraged to advertise procurement opportunities in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations, and send written notice of specific procurement opportunities to minority and women's business organizations.

      (c) All agency solicitations for bids or proposals shall include information referring potential bidders or proposers to the directories of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs prepared by the division.

      (d) In planning procurements, agencies shall consider the effect of the scope, specifications and size of a contract on opportunities for participation by MBEs, WBEs and EBEs.

      (e) Prior to soliciting bids or proposals for contracts valued at over ten million dollars, other than contracts for capital projects valued at over twenty-five million dollars and contracts that are exempt pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision q of this section, an agency shall submit the bid or proposal to the city chief procurement officer for a determination whether it is practicable to divide the proposed contract into smaller contracts and whether doing so will enhance competition for such contracts among MBEs, WBEs and EBEs and other potential bidders or proposers. If the city chief procurement officer determines that it is both practicable and advantageous in light of cost and other relevant factors to divide such contracts into smaller contracts, then he or she shall direct the agency to do so.

      (f) Agencies shall examine their internal procurement policies, procedures and practices and, where practicable, address those elements, if any, that may negatively affect participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in city procurement.

i. Participation goals for contracts for construction and professional and standard services.

   (1) Prior to issuing the solicitation of bids or proposals for individual contracts, agencies shall establish participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Such goals may be greater than, less than or the same as the relevant citywide goal or goals established pursuant to subdivision d of this section. Taking into account the factors listed in this subdivision, an agency may establish a goal for a procurement that may be achieved by a combination of prime contract and subcontract dollars, a combination of construction and services performed pursuant to the contract, and/or a combination of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs. Alternatively, an agency may establish specific goals for particular types of services, and/or goals for particular types of certified firms. In determining the participation goals for a particular contract, an agency shall consider the following factors:

      (a) the scope of work;

      (b) the availability of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs able to perform the particular tasks required in the contract;

      (c) the extent to which the type and scale of work involved in the contract present prime contracting and subcontracting opportunities for amounts within the capacity of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs;

      (d) the agency's progress to date toward meeting its annual participation goals through race-neutral, gender-neutral and other means, and the agency's expectations as to the effect such methods will have on participation of MBEs, WBEs and EBEs in the agency's future contracts; and

      (e) any other factors the contracting agency deems relevant.

   (2) A contracting agency shall not be required to establish participation goals for

      (i) procurements described in subdivision q of this section; or

      (ii) when the agency has already attained the relevant goal in its annual utilization plan, or expects that it will attain such goal without the use of such participation goals.

   (3) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, such agency shall state in the solicitation for such contract that bidders and/or proposers shall be required to agree as a material term of the contract that the contractor shall meet the participation goals unless such goals are waived or modified by the agency in accordance with this section. A contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be permitted to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the value of such a contractor's participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors. A contractor that is a qualified joint venture shall be permitted to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal. The value of such a contractor's participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this paragraph to the contrary, a contractor's achievement of participation goals shall be determined as described in paragraph two of subdivision j of this section.

   (4) For each contract in which participation goals are established, the agency shall include in its solicitation and/or bidding materials a referral to the directories prepared by the division pursuant to this section.

   (5) For each contract for which participation goals are established, the contractor shall be required to submit with its bid or proposal a contractor utilization plan indicating:

      (a) whether the contractor is an MBE, WBE, EBE, or a qualified joint venture;

      (b) the percentage of work it intends to award to direct subcontractors; and

      (c) in cases where the contractor intends to award direct subcontracts, a description of the type and dollar value of work designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs, and the time frames in which such work is scheduled to begin and end. When the contractor utilization plan indicates that the bidder or proposer does not intend to meet the participation goals, the bid or proposal shall not be deemed responsive unless the agency has granted a pre-award request for change pursuant to paragraph 11 of this subdivision.

   (6) (a) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contracting agency shall require that within thirty days of the issuance of notice to proceed, and at least once per year thereafter, the contractor submit a list of persons to which it intends to award subcontracts within the next twelve months. In the event that a contracting agency disapproves a contractor's selection of a subcontractor or subcontractors, the contracting agency shall allow such contractor a reasonable time to propose alternate subcontractors.

      (b) The contracting agency may also require the contractor to report periodically about the contracts awarded by its direct subcontractors to indirect subcontractors.

   (7) For each contract for which a contractor utilization plan has been submitted, the contractor shall, with each voucher for payment, and/or periodically as the agency may require, submit statements, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include, but not be limited to, the total amount the contractor paid to its direct subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of subdivision j of this section, the total amount direct subcontractors paid to indirect subcontractors, the names, addresses and contact numbers of each MBE, WBE or EBE hired as a subcontractor by the contractor or any of the contractor's direct subcontractors, as well as the dates and amounts paid to each MBE, WBE or EBE. The contractor shall also submit, along with its voucher for final payment, the total amount it paid to subcontractors, and, where applicable pursuant to subparagraph (l) of paragraph (1) of subdivision j of this section, the total amount its direct subcontractors paid directly to their indirect subcontractors; and a final list, certified under penalty of perjury, which shall include the name, address and contact information of each subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, the work performed by, and the dates and amounts paid to each.

   (8) If payments made to, or work performed by, MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are less than the amount specified in the contractor's utilization plan, the agency shall take appropriate action in accordance with subdivision o of this section, unless the contractor has obtained a modification of its utilization plan pursuant to paragraph 12 of this subdivision.

   (9) When advertising a solicitation for bids or proposals for a contract for which a participation goal has been established, agencies shall include in the advertisement a general statement that the contract will be subject to participation goals for MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.

   (10) In the event that a contractor with a contract that includes a contractor utilization plan submits a request for a change order the value of which exceeds the greater of ten percent of such contract or $500,000, the agency shall review the scope of work for the contract, and the scale and types of work involved in the change order, and determine whether the participation goals should be modified.

   (11) Requests from bidders or proposers for changes in participation goals.

      (a) A bidder or proposer may request that an agency change the participation goal or goals established for the procurement on the grounds that goals are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, or by demonstrating that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing a lower level of subcontracting in its utilization plan.

      (b) If the contracting agency determines that the participation goals established for the procurement are unreasonable in light of the availability of certified firms to perform the services required, it shall revise the solicitation and extend the deadline for bids and proposals.

      (c) Subject to subparagraph (d) of this paragraph, the contracting agency may grant a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to a bidder or proposer who demonstrates that it has legitimate business reasons for proposing the level of subcontracting in its utilization plan. The contracting agency shall make its determination in light of factors that shall include, but not be limited to, whether the bidder or proposer has the capacity and the bona fide intention to perform the contract without any subcontracting, or to perform the contract without awarding the amount of subcontracts represented by the participation goals. In making such determination, the agency may consider whether the utilization plan is consistent with past subcontracting practices of the bidder or proposer, whether the bidder or proposer has made efforts to form a joint venture with a certified firm, and whether the bidder or proposer has made good faith efforts to identify portions of the contract that it intends to subcontract. The city chief contracting officer shall notify the council of any such waiver granted with respect to a registered contract in the quarterly report required pursuant to subdivision l of this section.

      (d) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for a full or partial waiver of the participation goals to the division and the city chief procurement officer and shall not approve any such request without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer shall notify the speaker of the council in writing in the quarterly report required pursuant to subdivision l of this section following the registration of a contract for which a request for a full or partial waiver of a participation goal was granted, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant waivers without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original participation goal, the waiver request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.

   (12) Modification of utilization plans at contractor's request or agency's initiative.

      (a) A contractor may request modification of its utilization plan after the award of a contract. Subject to subparagraph (b) of this paragraph, an agency may grant such request if it determines that such contractor has established, with appropriate documentary and other evidence, that it made all reasonable, good faith efforts to meet the goals set by the agency for the contract. In making such determination, the agency shall consider evidence of the following efforts, as applicable, along with any other relevant factors:

         (i) The contractor advertised opportunities to participate in the contract, where appropriate, in general circulation media, trade and professional association publications and small business media, and publications of minority and women's business organizations;

         (ii) The contractor provided notice of specific opportunities to participate in the contract, in a timely manner, to minority and women's business organizations;

         (iii) The contractor sent written notices, by certified mail or facsimile, in a timely manner, to advise MBEs, WBEs or EBEs that their interest in the contract was solicited;

         (iv) The contractor made efforts to identify portions of the work that could be substituted for portions originally designated for participation by MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs in the contractor utilization plan, and for which the contractor claims an inability to retain MBEs, WBEs or EBEs;

         (v) The contractor held meetings with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs prior to the date their bids or proposals were due, for the purpose of explaining in detail the scope and requirements of the work for which their bids or proposals were solicited;

         (vi) The contractor made efforts to negotiate with MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs as relevant to perform specific subcontracts, or act as suppliers or service providers;

         (vii) Timely written requests for assistance made by the contractor to the agency M/WBE liaison officer and to the division; and

         (viii) Description of how recommendations made by the division and the contracting agency were acted upon and an explanation of why action upon such recommendations did not lead to the desired level of participation of MBEs, WBEs and/or EBEs.

      (b) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice of requests for such modifications to the division and the city chief procurement officer and shall not approve any such request for modification without the approval of the city chief procurement officer, provided that the city chief procurement officer, upon adequate assurances of an agency's ability to administer its utilization plan in accordance with the provisions of this section, may determine that further approval from the city chief procurement officer is not required with respect to such requests for an agency's contracts or particular categories of an agency's contracts. The city chief procurement officer, shall notify the speaker of the council in writing within seven days of the approval of a request for modification of a utilization plan, provided that where an agency has been authorized to grant modifications without approval of the chief procurement officer, such notice shall be provided to the speaker of the council by the agency. Such notification shall include, but not be limited to, the name of the contractor, the original utilization plan, the modification request, including all documentation, and an explanation for the approval of such request.

      (c) An agency may modify the participation goals established for a procurement when the scope of the work has been changed by the agency in a manner that affects the scale and types of work that the contractor indicated in its contractor utilization plan would be awarded to subcontractors.

      (d) The agency M/WBE officer shall provide written notice to the contractor of its determination that shall include the reasons for such deter-mination.

   (13) For each contract in which a contracting agency has established participation goals, the agency shall evaluate and assess the contractor's performance in meeting each such goal. Such evaluation and assessment shall be a part of the contractor's overall contract performance evaluation required pursuant to section 333 of the charter.

j. Determining credit for MBE, WBE and EBE participation.

   (1) An agency's achievement of its annual goals shall be calculated as follows:

      (a) The dollar amount that an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a prime contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the contractor has paid or is obligated to pay its direct subcontractors upon their completion of work, shall be credited toward the relevant goal. Where an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a prime contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

      (b) Except as provided in subparagraph (c) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay to a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

      (c) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a prime contractor of an agency has paid or is obligated to pay a direct subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE, or EBE, reduced by the dollar amount the direct subcontractor has paid or is obligated to pay its indirect subcontractors upon completion of work, shall be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay a direct contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

      (d) In the case of contracts of the types identified pursuant to subparagraph (l) of this paragraph, the total dollar amount that a direct subcontractor of the prime contractor has paid or is obligated to pay to an indirect subcontractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a contractor has paid or is obligated to pay an indirect contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

      (e) For requirements contracts, credit shall be given for the actual dollar amount paid under the contract.

      (f) Where one or more MBEs, WBEs or EBEs is participating in a qualified joint venture, the amounts that the joint venture is required to pay its direct subcontractors shall be subtracted as provided in subparagraph (a) of this paragraph, and then a percentage of the remaining dollar amount of the contract equal to the percentage of total profit to which MBEs, WBEs or EBEs are entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement shall be credited toward the relevant goal. Where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall be credited toward the relevant goal for MBEs or the goal for WBEs.

      (g) No credit shall be given for participation in a contract by an MBE, WBE or EBE that does not perform a commercially useful function.

      (h) No credit shall be given for the participation in a contract by any company that has not been certified as an MBE, WBE or EBE in accordance with section 1304 of the charter.

      (i) In the case of a contract for which the contractor is paid on a commission basis, the dollar amount of the contract may be determined on the basis of the commission earned or reasonably anticipated to be earned under the contract.

      (j) No credit shall be given to a contractor for participation in a contract by a graduate MBE, WBE or EBE.

      (k) The participation of a certified company shall not be credited toward more than one participation goal.

      (l) The city chief procurement officer may identify types of contracts where payments to indirect subcontractors shall be credited toward the relevant participation goals.

   (2) A contractor's achievement of its participation goals established in its utilization plan shall be calculated as follows:

      (a) A contractor's use of direct subcontractors and their indirect subcontractors toward achievement of each goal established in its utilization plan shall be calculated in the same manner as described for calculating the achievement of agency utilization goals as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that a contractor's use of a subcontractor that is both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited toward the contractor's achievement of more than one goal;

      (b) A contractor that is an MBE, WBE or EBE shall be permitted to count its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal, provided that the value of such a contractor's participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and provided further that a contractor that is both an MBE and a WBE shall not be credited for its participation toward more than one goal;

      (c) No credit shall be given to the contractor for the participation of a company that is not certified in accordance with section 1304 of the charter before the date that the subcontractor completes the work under the subcontract.

      (d) A contractor that is a qualified joint venture shall be permitted to count a percentage of its own participation toward fulfillment of the relevant participation goal. The value of such a contractor's participation shall be determined by subtracting from the total value of the contract any amounts that the contractor pays to direct subcontractors, and then multiplying the remainder by the percentage to be applied to total profit to determine the amount to which an MBE, WBE or EBE is entitled pursuant to the joint venture agreement; provided that where such a participant in a joint venture is both an MBE and a WBE, such amount shall not be credited toward more than one goal.

k. Small purchases. Whenever an agency solicits bids or proposals for small purchases pursuant to section three hundred fourteen of the charter, the agency shall maintain records identifying the MBEs, WBEs and EBEs it solicited, which shall become part of the contract file.

l. Compliance reporting.

   (4) No later than the day on which any work begins at any city economic development project subject to the requirements of this section, a covered developer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every such city economic development project and provide each building service employee a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which building service employees are entitled under this section.

At the start of such investigation, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by subdivision 2 of section 235 of the state labor law, request that the relevant contracting agency or entity withhold any payment due to the covered lessor or covered developer in order to safeguard the rights of the building service employees.

In assessing an appropriate remedy, due consideration shall be given to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, the good faith of the covered lessor or covered developer, and the failure to comply with record-keeping, notice, reporting, or other non-wage requirements. Any civil penalty shall be deposited in the general fund.

   (5) In addition to the provisions provided in subparagraph a of this paragraph, in the case of a covered developer, based upon the investigation provided in this paragraph, the comptroller shall also report the results of such investigation to the city economic development entity, which may impose a remedy as such entity deems appropriate as within its statutorily prescribed authority, including rescindment of the award of financial assistance.

Such person or covered employer shall be notified of a hearing date by the office of administrative trials and hearings, or other appropriate agency or tribunal, and shall have the opportunity to be heard in respect to such matters.

   (7) When a final disposition has been made in favor of a building service employee and the person found violating this section has failed to comply with the payment or other terms of the remedial order of the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, and provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding has expired, the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, shall file a copy of such order containing the amount found to be due with the clerk of the county of residence or place of business of the person found to have violated this section, or of any principal or officer thereof who knowingly participated in the violation of this section. The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be enforced by and in the name of the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, in the same manner and with like effect as that prescribed by the state civil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment.

   (8) In an investigation conducted under the provisions of this section, the inquiry of the comptroller or mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, shall not extend to work performed more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint, or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier.

e. Civil action.

   (1) Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this section shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a complaint with the comptroller or the mayor with respect to such claim. In an action brought by a building service employee, if the court finds in favor of the employee, it shall award the employee, in addition to other relief, his/her reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

   (2) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph 1 of this subdivision where a complaint filed with the comptroller or the mayor is dismissed an aggrieved person shall maintain all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this chapter as if no such complaint had been filed.

   (3) A civil action commenced under this section shall be commenced in accordance with subdivision 2 of section 214 of New York civil practice law and rules,

   (4) No procedure or remedy set forth in this section is intended to be exclusive or a prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights hereunder in a court of law. This section shall not be construed to limit an employee's right to bring a common law cause of action for wrongful termination.

   (5) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section or of, any other general, special or local law, ordinance, city charter or administrative code, a building service employee affected by this law shall not be barred from the right to recover the difference between the amount paid to the employee and the amount which should have been paid to the employee under the provisions of this section because of the prior receipt by the employee without protest of wages or benefits paid, or on account of the building service employee's failure to state orally or in writing upon any payroll or receipt which the employee is required to sign that the wages or benefits received by the employee are received under protest, or on account of the employee's failure to indicate a protest against the amount, or that the amount so paid does not constitute payment in full of wages or benefits due the employee for the period covered by such payment.

f. Application to existing leases. Nothing contained herein shall operate to impair any existing lease, except that extension, renewal, amendment or modification of such lease occurring on or after the enactment of the local law that added this section shall make the entire lease subject to the conditions specified in this section; provided however, in cases where a contracting agency has multiple leases at the same building with a non-governmental entity, the provisions of this section shall not apply until the lease covering the largest amount of square footage at such building is extended, renewed, amended, or modified.

h. Severability. In the event that any requirement or provision of this section, or its application to any person or circumstance, should be held invalid or unenforceable by an court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other requirements or provisions of this section, or the application of the requirement or provision held unenforceable to any other person or circumstance.

i. Competing laws. This section shall be liberally construed in favor of its purposes. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting or conflicting with any other obligation or law, including any collective bargaining agreement, that mandates the provision of higher or superior wages, benefits, or protections to covered employees. No requirement or provision of this section shall be construed as applying to any person or circumstance where such coverage would be preempted by federal or state law.

   (6) "Entity"or "Person"means any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, association, joint venture, limited liability company, corporation or any other form of doing business.

   (7) "Financial assistance"means assistance that is provided to a financial assistance recipient for the improvement or development of real property, economic development, job retention and growth, or other similar purposes, and that is provided either (a) directly by the city, or (b) indirectly by a city economic development entity and that is paid in whole or in part by the city, and that at the time the financial assistance recipient enters into a project agreement with the city or city economic development entity is expected to have a total present financial value of one million dollars or more. Financial assistance includes, but is not limited to, cash payments or grants, bond financing, tax abatements or exemptions (including, but not limited to, abatements or exemptions from real property, mortgage recording, sales and use taxes, or the difference between any payments in lieu of taxes and the amount of real property or other taxes that would have been due if the property were not exempted from the payment of such taxes), tax increment financing, filing fee waivers, energy cost reductions, environmental remediation costs, write-downs in the market value of building, land, or leases, or the cost of capital improvements undertaken for the benefit of a project subject to a project agreement.

The portion of the hourly compensation package consisting of the health benefits supplement rate may be provided in the form of cash wages, health benefits or any combination of the two. The value of any health benefits received shall be determined based on the prorated hourly cost to the employer of the health benefits received by the employee.

The adjusted living wage rate and health benefits supplement rate shall each then be rounded to the nearest five cents. Such adjusted rates shall be announced no later than January 1 of each year and shall become effective as the new living wage rate and health benefits supplement rate on April 1 of each year. For employees who customarily and regularly receive tips, the financial assistance recipient may credit any tips received and retained by the employee towards the living wage rate. For each pay period that an employee's base cash wages and tips received total less than the living wage rate multiplied by the number of hours worked, the financial assistance recipient must pay the employee the difference in cash wages.

   (10) "Not-for-profit organization"means an entity that is either incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation under the laws of the state of its incorporation or exempt from federal income tax pursuant to subdivision c of section five hundred one of the United States internal revenue code.

   (3) The requirements of this section shall apply for the term of the financial assistance or for ten years, whichever is longer, from the date of commencement of the project subject to a project agreement or the date the project subject to a project agreement commences operations, whichever is later.

d. Exemptions. The requirements established under this section shall not apply to the following entities or persons except with respect to the reporting requirements set forth in paragraph 2 of subdivision f of this section:

   (1) Any otherwise covered employer that is a small business, which shall be defined as an entity that has annual gross revenues of less than five million dollars.

   (2) Any otherwise covered employer that is a not-for-profit organization.

   (3) Any otherwise covered employer whose principal industry conducted at the project location is manufacturing, as defined by the North American Industry Classification System.

   (4) Any otherwise covered employer operating on the premises of a project where residential units comprise more than 75% of the project area, and no less than 75% of the residential units are affordable for families earning less than 125% of the area median income.

   (7) Any otherwise covered employer, excepting a financial assistance recipient who executed a project agreement and any entity with which such financial assistance recipient contracts or subcontracts, occupying or operating on the premises of property improved or developed within the geographical delineations described in the definition of "Zone 3 Adjacent Developments,"without regard to whether or not the applicable project is deemed to be a "Hudson Yards Commercial Construction Project,"as such terms are defined in the first amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Uniform Tax Exemption Policy of the New York City Industrial Development Agency, as approved by the board of directors of the city industrial development agency on November 9, 2010, provided, however, that such exemption shall not extend to any such covered employer who receives financial assistance through the purchase of a condominium in the event that the city or city economic development entity grants such covered employer additional financial subsidies in addition to the financial assistance originally granted pursuant to such project agreement thereafter assigned or otherwise made available to such purchaser following such purchase.

e. Notice Posting, Recordkeeping and Retaliation.

   (1) No later than the day on which an employee begins work at a site subject to the requirements of this section, a covered employer shall post in a prominent and accessible place at every such work site and provide each employee a copy of a written notice, prepared by the comptroller, detailing the wages, benefits, and other protections to which employees are entitled under this section. Such notice shall also provide the name, address and telephone number of the comptroller and a statement advising employees that if they have been paid less that the living wage they may notify the comptroller and request an investigation. Such notices shall be provided in English and Spanish. The comptroller shall provide the city with sample written notices explaining the rights of employees and covered employers' obligations under this section, and the city shall in turn provide those written notices to covered employers.

   (2) A covered employer shall maintain original payroll records for each of its employees reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked, and shall retain such records for at least six years after the work is performed. Failure to maintain such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the covered employer did not pay its employees the wages and benefits required under this section. Upon the request of the comptroller or the city, the covered employer shall provide a certified original payroll record.

   (3) It shall be unlawful for any covered employer to retaliate, discharge, demote, suspend, take adverse employment action in the terms and conditions of employment or otherwise discriminate against any employee for reporting or asserting a violation of this section, for seeking or communicating information regarding rights conferred by this section, for exercising any other rights protected under this section, or for participating in any investigatory, administrative, or court proceeding relating to this section. This protection shall also apply to any covered employee or his or her representative who in good faith alleges a violation of this section, or who seeks or communicates information regarding rights conferred by this section in circumstances where he or she in good faith believes this section applies. Taking adverse employment action against an employee or his or her representative within sixty days of the employee engaging in any of the aforementioned activities shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in retaliation for those activities. Any employee subjected to any action that violates this paragraph may pursue administrative remedies or bring a civil action as authorized pursuant to subdivision g of this section in a court of competent jurisdiction.

f. Implementation and Reporting.

   (1) Each financial assistance recipient shall provide to the comptroller and the city or city economic development entity that executed the project agreement an annual certification, executed under penalty of perjury, stating that all of its employees are paid no less than a living wage, confirming the notification to all covered employers operating on its premises that such employers must pay their employees no less than a living wage and comply with all other requirements of this section, providing the names, addresses and telephone numbers of such employers, and affirming its obligation to assist the city to investigate and remedy non-compliance of such employers. Where the financial assistance applies only to certain property, such statement shall be required only for the employees employed on such property. Where there are multiple covered employers operating on the premises of a financial assistance recipient, each covered employer shall, prior to commencing work at such premises, provide a statement certifying that all the employees employed by each such covered employer on the property subject to a project agreement are paid no less than a living wage. All statements shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the covered employer, or the designee of any such person. A violation of any provision of such certified statements shall constitute a violation of this section by the party committing the violation of such provision.

   (2) An otherwise covered employer that qualifies for an exemption from the requirements of this section under subdivision d of this section shall provide a statement, executed under penalty of perjury, certifying that the employer qualifies for an exemption and specifying the basis for that exemption. Such an employer shall update or withdraw such statement on a timely basis if its eligibility for the claimed exemption should change.

   (3) The comptroller and the city or city economic development entity that executed the project agreement may inspect the records maintained pursuant to paragraph 2 of subdivision e of this section to verify the certifications submitted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subdivision.

   (4) The city or city economic development entity that executed the project agreement shall maintain for four years all certifications submitted pursuant to this subdivision and make them available for public inspection.

   (5) The city shall maintain a list of financial assistance recipients subject to project agreements that shall include, where a project agreement is targeted to particular real property, the address of each such property. Such list shall be updated and published as often as is necessary to keep it current.

g. Monitoring, Investigation and Enforcement.

   (1) The comptroller shall monitor covered employers' compliance with the requirements of this section. Whenever the comptroller has reason to believe there has been a violation of this section, or upon a verified complaint in writing from an employee or an employee's representative claiming a violation of this section, the comptroller shall conduct an investigation to determine the facts relating thereto. The name of any employee identified in a complaint shall be kept confidential as long as possible, and may be disclosed only with the employee's consent, provided, however, that such consent shall not be required once notice is required to be given pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subdivision. For the purpose of conducting investigations pursuant to this section, the comptroller shall have the authority to observe work being performed on the work site, to interview employees during or after work hours, and to examine the books and records relating to the payrolls being investigated to determine whether or not the covered employer is in compliance with this section. At the start of such investigation, the comptroller may, in a manner consistent with the withholding procedures established by subdivision 2 of section 235 of the state labor law, request that the city or city economic development entity that executed the project agreement withhold any payment due to the financial assistance recipient in order to safeguard the rights of the employees.

   (2) The comptroller shall report the results of such investigation to the mayor, or his or her designee, who shall, in accordance with provisions of paragraph 4 of this subdivision and after providing the covered employer an opportunity to cure any violations, where appropriate issue an order, determination, or other disposition, including, but not limited to, a stipulation of settlement. Such order, determination, or disposition may, at the discretion of the mayor, or his or her designee, impose the following on the covered employer committing the applicable violations:

      (a) Direct payment of wages and/or the monetary equivalent of benefits wrongly denied, including interest from the date of underpayment to the employee, based on the interest rate then in effect as prescribed by the superintendent of banks pursuant to section 14-a of the state banking law, but in any event at a rate no less than six percent per year;

      (b) Direct payment of a further sum as a civil penalty in an amount not exceeding two hundred percent of the total amount found to be due in violation of this section;

      (c) Direct the filing or disclosure of any records that were not filed or made available to the public as required by this section;

      (d) Direct the reinstatement of, or other appropriate relief for, any person found to have been subjected to retaliation or discrimination in violation of this section;

      (e) Direct payment of the sums withheld at the commencement of the investigation and the interest that has accrued thereon to the financial assistance recipient; and

      (f) Declare ineligible to receive financial assistance or prohibit from operating as a covered employer on the premises of a financial assistance recipient or on real property improved or developed with financial assistance any person against whom a final disposition has been entered in two instances within any consecutive six year period determining that such person has willfully failed to pay the required wages in accordance with the provisions of this section or to comply with the anti-retaliation, recordkeeping, notice, or reporting requirements of this section.

   (3) In assessing an appropriate remedy, due consideration shall be given to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations, the good faith of the covered employer, and the failure to comply with record-keeping, notice, reporting, or other non-wage requirements. Any civil penalty shall be deposited in the city general fund.

   (4) Before issuing an order, determination, or any other disposition, the mayor or his or her designee shall give notice thereof, together with a copy of the complaint, which notice shall be served personally or by mail on any person affected thereby. The mayor, or his or her designee, may negotiate an agreed upon stipulation of settlement or refer the matter to the office of administrative trials and hearings for a hearing and disposition. Such covered employer shall be notified of a hearing date by the office of administrative trials and hearings, or other appropriate tribunal, and shall have the opportunity to be heard in respect to such matters.

   (5) When a final disposition has been made in favor of an employee and the person found violating this section has failed to comply with the payment or other terms of the remedial order of the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, and provided that no proceeding for judicial review shall then be pending and the time for initiation of such proceeding has expired, the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, shall file a copy of such order containing the amount found to be due with the clerk of the county of residence or place of business of the person found to have violated this section, or of any principal or officer thereof who knowingly participated in the violation of this section. The filing of such order shall have the full force and effect of a judgment duly docketed in the office of such clerk. The order may be enforced by and in the name of the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, in the same manner and with like effect as that prescribed by the state civil practice law and rules for the enforcement of a money judgment.

   (6) In an investigation conducted under the provisions of this section, the inquiry of the comptroller or mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable, shall not extend to work performed more than three years prior to the filing of the complaint, or the commencement of such investigation, whichever is earlier.

   (7) Upon determining that a covered employer is not in compliance, and where no cure is effected and approved by the mayor, or his or her designee, as applicable pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subdivision, the city or city economic development entity shall take such actions against such covered employer as may be appropriate and provided for by law, rule, or contract, including, but not limited to: declaring the financial assistance recipient who has committed a violation in default of the project agreement; imposing sanctions; or recovering from such covered employer the financial assistance disbursed or provided to such covered employer, including but not limited to requiring repayment of any taxes or interest abated or deferred.

   (8) Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be aggrieved by a violation of this section shall have a cause of action in any court of competent jurisdiction for damages, including punitive damages, and for injunctive relief and such other remedies as may be appropriate, unless such person has filed a complaint with the comptroller or the mayor with respect to such claim. In an action brought by an employee, if the court finds in favor of the employee, it shall award the employee, in addition to other relief, his/her reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

   (9) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraph 8 of this subdivision, where a complaint filed with the comptroller or the mayor is dismissed an aggrieved person shall maintain all rights to commence a civil action pursuant to this chapter as if no such complaint had been filed, provided, however, that for purposes of this paragraph the failure of the comptroller or the mayor to issue a disposition within one year of the filing of a complaint shall be deemed to be a dismissal.

   (10) A civil action commenced under this section shall be commenced in accordance with subdivision 2 of section 214 of the New York civil practice law and rules.

   (11) No procedure or remedy set forth in this section is intended to be exclusive or a prerequisite for asserting a claim for relief to enforce any rights hereunder in a court of law. This section shall not be construed to limit an employee's right to bring a common law cause of action for wrongful termination.

   (12) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of this section or any other general, specific, or local law, ordinance, city charter, or administrative code, an employee affected by this law shall not be barred from the right to recover the difference between the amount paid to the employee and the amount which should have been paid to the employee under the provisions of this section because of the prior receipt by the employee without protest of wages or benefits paid, or on account of the employee's failure to state orally or in writing upon any payroll or receipt which the employee is required to sign that the wages or benefits received by the employee are received under protest, or on account of the employee's failure to indicate a protest against the amount, or that the amount so paid does not constitute payment in full of wages or benefits due to the employee for the period covered by such payment.

h. Living Wage Preferred.

   (1) The city and city economic development entity shall encourage living wage jobs on economic development projects, including those jobs offered by tenants, sub-tenants, and leaseholders of subsidy recipients, by employing measures that may include exercising a preference when evaluating responses to requests for proposals and other solicitations for those parties who commit to the payment of a living wage and those who demonstrate that they have paid and/or required related parties to pay a living wage on prior projects. The city and city economic development entity shall strive to achieve a living wage for 75% or more of the hourly jobs created overall with respect to the portfolio of all such economic development projects.

   (2) Upon entering into any agreement to develop property for an economic development project, the city or city economic development entity shall submit to the council a report detailing its efforts to provide living wage jobs. Such report shall indicate whether its agreement with the economic development subsidy recipient mandated the payment of a living wage for any jobs created by the project. If the agreement includes such a mandate, the city or city economic development entity shall provide an analysis outlining the number of living wage jobs anticipated to be created beyond those jobs for which a living wage is required pursuant to this section and a description of the applicable penalties if the wage requirement in the agreement is not ultimately fulfilled. If the agreement does not include such a mandate, the city or city economic development entity shall explain why such an agreement could not be reached.

   (3) The city shall submit to the council and post on the city's website by January 31 of each year a report detailing the extent to which projects that receive financial assistance provide employees a living wage. Such reports shall provide, for employees at each site covered by the project in the categories of industrial jobs, restaurant jobs, retail jobs, and other jobs, including all permanent and temporary full-time employees, permanent and temporary part-time employees, and contract employees, the total number of employees and the number and percentage of employees earning less than a living wage, as that term is defined in this section. Reports with regard to projects for which assistance was received prior to July 1, 2012 need only contain such information required by this paragraph as is available to the city, can be reasonably derived from available sources, and can be reasonably obtained from the business entity to which assistance was provided.

i. Miscellaneous.

   (1) The provisions of this section shall not apply to any financial assistance that was provided prior to the enactment of the local law that added this section, nor shall they apply to any project agreement that was entered into or to any project for which an inducement resolution was adopted in furtherance of entering into a project agreement prior to the enactment of the local law that added this section, except that extension, renewal, amendment or modification of such project agreement occurring on or after the enactment of the local law that added this section that results in the grant of any additional financial assistance to the financial assistance recipient shall make the financial assistance recipient and any other covered employers operating on the premises of the financial assistance recipient or at the real property improved or developed with financial assistance subject to the requirements of this section.

   (2) In the event that any requirement or provision of this section, or its application to any person or circumstance, should be held invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not invalidate or render unenforceable any other requirements or provisions of this section, or the application of the requirement or provision held unenforceable to any other person or circumstance. To this end, the parts of this section are severable.

   (3) This section shall be liberally construed in favor of its purposes. This section shall not be construed to preempt or otherwise limit the applicability of any law, policy, contract term or other action by the city or a city economic development entity that provides for payment of higher or supplemental wages or benefits, or for additional penalties or remedies for violation of this or any other law.
