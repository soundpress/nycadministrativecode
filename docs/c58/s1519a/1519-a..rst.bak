        (i)  For  properties  the  taxes  for  which  are  due in quarterly or

      paragraph (c) of subdivision two of this section, shall be one-third  of
      the discount percentage described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.
        (f)  A  discount  shall be allowed only if all prior installments have
      been paid or are paid at the same time  as  the  payments  for  which  a
      discount would apply.
        (g)(i)  The  commissioner  may provide a discount, at a percentage not
      more than two times the  discount  percentage  established  pursuant  to
      paragraph  (c)  or  (d)  of this subdivision, to taxpayers who pay their
      real property taxes by  electronic  funds  transfer.  This  subparagraph
      shall  apply  only to taxpayers who are not required by law to pay their
      real property taxes by electronic funds transfer. The commissioner shall
      establish such discount percentage by rule and may promulgate such other
      rules as may be necessary to implement this subparagraph.
        (ii) The commissioner may provide a discount, at a percentage not more
      than two times the discount percentage established pursuant to paragraph
      (c) or (d) of this subdivision, to taxpayers whose annual real  property
      tax  liability  exceeds  one  million  dollars  and  who  pay their real
      property taxes before the date such taxes become due and payable,  where
      the  commissioner  determines  by  rule  that  it  would  be in the best
      interests of the city to provide an incentive  for  such  payment  by  a
      specified  date and at a specified discount percentage. The commissioner
      may promulgate such other rules as may be necessary  to  implement  this
      subparagraph.

      vesting  date,  and interest, shall be due and payable, and shall become
      an equitable lien with first priority against any condemnation award.
