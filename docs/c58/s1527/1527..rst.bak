Section 1527. ::    
        
     
        §  1527.  Contracts  with  collection agencies. 1. Notwithstanding any
      other provisions of law to the contrary, the commissioner may enter into
      contracts with collection agencies for the collection of (i) any or  all
      tax  warrants  and judgments for all city taxes subject to collection by
      the department, other than real property taxes, or (ii) city  water  and
      sewer  charges,  or both; provided however, that any such contract shall
      be subject to the provisions of sections three hundred twelve and  three
      hundred thirteen.
        2.    Any  such  contract  shall  apply  only to such tax warrants and
      judgments and to such water and sewer charges as  the  commissioner  may
      refer  to  the collection agency, and shall be terminable at the will of
      the commissioner.
        3.  The consideration to be paid to such collection agency  may  be  a
      percentage  or percentages of the amount collected by such agency, or as
      otherwise provided in the contract,  but  shall  be  within  the  amount
      appropriated and available for such purpose.
        4.  No legal action to collect tax warrants and judgments or water and
      sewer  charges  under any contract entered into pursuant to this section
      shall be  initiated  without  the  express  written  permission  of  the
      corporation  counsel,  and  the  selection  of any attorney to take such
      legal action shall  be  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  corporation
      counsel.
        5.     Before  beginning  performance  of  a  contract  authorized  by
      subdivision one of this section, the contracting collection agency shall
      give security for faithful performance and shall provide such  insurance
      policies, including but not limited to a comprehensive general liability
      insurance,  naming  the city as a party in interest, as the commissioner
      may require.    The  adequacy  and  sufficiency  of  such  security  and
      insurance  policies,  as  well  as the justification and acknowledgement
      thereof, shall be   subject to the approval of  the  comptroller.    The
      commissioner,  in his or her discretion, may require additional security
      or insurance in such amounts and  running  to  such  city  officers  and
      employees  as  the  commissioner  may require, to indemnify them for any
      liability incurred by reason of any act or omission of  such  collection
      agency.
        6.  No contract entered into pursuant to this section may be so worded
      as  to grant to any contracting collection agency the exclusive right to
      perform any work authorized by this section.
