        1.  Real  property  assessment.  With  respect  to  real  property tax
      assessment, the department shall assess for  taxation  all  the  taxable
      real  property  in  the  city  and  prepare  the  assessment  rolls. The
      commissioner shall appoint, within the appropriation therefor,  as  many
      assessors as shall be necessary for the performance of such functions in
      accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
        2.  Tax  collection. a. The department shall administer all excise and
      non-property taxes imposed or administered by the city. With respect  to
      such taxes, the department shall have the power to settle and adjust all
      claims in favor of or against the city and, except with respect to cases
      within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  tax  appeals tribunal established by
      section one hundred sixty-eight of this charter, to make  determinations
      in  contested cases. For such purposes, the commissioner or his delegate
      may, except with respect to cases within the jurisdiction  of  such  tax
      appeals tribunal, hold hearings and administer oaths.
        b.  The  department  shall  collect all real property taxes, water and
      sewer charges, other assessments and arrears against real  property  and
      all other taxes, assessments and arrears payable to the city.
        c. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law
      to  the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority to
      compromise any excise or nonproperty taxes or annual  vault  charges  or
      any  warrant or judgment for excise or nonproperty taxes or annual vault
      charges administered by  the  commissioner,  and  the  civil  penalties,
      interest  and additions to tax or charge in connection therewith, if the
      tax debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy,  or  is  shown  by  proofs
      submitted to be insolvent, but the amount payable in compromise shall in
      no  event  be  less  than  the amount, if any, recoverable through legal
      proceedings, and provided that where the  amount  owing  for  excise  or
      nonproperty  taxes  or  annual  vault  charges,  exclusive  of any civil
      penalties, interest and additions to tax or charge, or  the  warrant  or
      judgment,  exclusive  of  any civil penalties, interest and additions to
      tax  or  charge,  is  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars,  such
      compromise  shall  be  effective  only when approved by a justice of the
      supreme court.
        d. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law
      to the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority  to
      compromise  civil liability, with such qualifications and limitations as
      may be established pursuant  to  such  rules  as  the  commissioner  may
      prescribe,  where  such liability arises in connection with an excise or
      nonproperty tax or annual vault charge administered by the commissioner,
      at any time prior to the time the tax or administrative  action  becomes
      finally  and  irrevocably  fixed and no longer subject to administrative
      review. Upon acceptance of an offer in compromise by  the  commissioner,
      the  matter  may  not  be  reopened  except  upon  a  showing  of fraud,
      malfeasance or misrepresentation of a  material  fact.  The  corporation
      counsel  may  compromise  any  such liability after reference to the law
      department for prosecution or defense at any time prior to the time  the
      tax  or  administrative  action  taken  by  the  department is no longer
      subject to administrative or judicial review. Whenever a  compromise  is
    
      made  by  the department of any such liability, there shall be placed on
      file in the office of the commissioner the opinion of  the  commissioner
      or  a  deputy  commissioner, with reasons therefor, with a statement of:
      (i)  the  amount of excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge and
      any other issues that may be the subject of such  compromise,  (ii)  the
      amount  of  interest,  additions to the tax or penalty imposed by law on
      the taxpayer or other persons against whom the administrative action was
      taken  by  the  department,  and  (iii)  the  amount  actually  paid  in
      accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  compromise.  Notwithstanding  the
      preceding sentence, no such opinion shall be required  with  respect  to
      the  compromise of any civil liability in which the unpaid amount of the
      excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge that was the subject of
      the administrative action (including any interest, additions to tax,  or
      penalty) is less than twenty-five thousand dollars.
        e.  Nothing in paragraph c or d of this subdivision shall be construed
      to diminish or otherwise impair any power of  the  department  exercised
      pursuant to any other provision of law.
        3. Deposit and payment of moneys in the city treasury; trust funds.
        a.  The  department  shall  have the power and duty to provide for the
      reception and safekeeping of all moneys paid into the  treasury  of  the
      city  and  for  the  payment  of  all  moneys  on  warrants drawn by the
      comptroller and countersigned by the commissioner.
        b. The department shall administer and manage all trust funds received
      or held by the city pursuant to a judgment, decree or order of any court
      or under section eleven hundred twenty-three of  the  surrogate's  court
      procedure  act,  section  ninety-nine-m  of  the  general municipal law,
      sections eighty-seven and three-h of the social services  law,  sections
      four hundred twenty-six and four hundred thirty-two of the real property
      law,  section two hundred four of the lien law, and section five hundred
      fifty-three of the county law, and in such administration  it  shall  be
      deemed  to  be  acting  in  a  fiduciary  capacity. The department shall
      provide for the receipt and safekeeping of all such moneys of the  trust
      funds  held  by the city and disburse the same on warrants signed by the
      comptroller.
        c. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and unless
      otherwise determined by the court which directed payment of the funds in
      the first instance, for purposes of administering and managing the trust
      funds, other than cemetery trust funds, enumerated  in  paragraph  b  of
      this  subdivision,  whenever  the department is permitted or required by
      law to deposit such funds in a savings bank,  trust  company,  bank,  or
      banking  association,  or  to  invest such funds in its discretion or in
      legal investments for trustees or  savings  banks,  the  department  may
      combine  all such trust funds into one or more common trust funds, which
      may be deposited in  such  savings  banks,  trust  companies,  banks  or
      banking associations as are designated by the state comptroller pursuant
      to  section one hundred eighty-two of the state finance law, or invested
      in legal investments for trustees or savings  banks.  Such  funds,  when
      deposited in a savings bank, trust company, bank or banking association,
      may  be  placed  in  demand  or  time  deposit  accounts, including time
      certificates of deposit, and such deposits shall be either insured by  a
      federal   deposit  insurance  corporation  or  fully  collateralized  by
      securities acceptable to the state comptroller.
        (ii)  The  department  may  retain  trust  funds  temporarily  pending
      investment  or  deposit  or to meet cash requirements in connection with
      the deposit or withdrawal of such funds, but such temporary retention of
      trust funds shall not deprive any owner or  beneficiary  of  any  income
      therefrom  to which the owner or beneficiary would otherwise be entitled
      by law.
    
        (iii) When trust  funds  are  received  by  the  department  it  shall
      forthwith  open  and maintain a separate ledger account for each action,
      proceeding or matter and shall keep an  exact  accounting  of  all  such
      funds  and  all  income  earned  thereon  in  such  manner  as the state
      comptroller may prescribe.
        4. Parking violations bureau. The department shall operate and control
      the  parking  violations  bureau.  The  commissioner  shall  appoint the
      director of the bureau, deputy  director  and  all  other  officers  and
      employees of the bureau, and hearing examiners.

      pursuant  to  subdivision  b  of section two hundred fifty-four, the tax
      rates adopted for the current fiscal year shall be deemed to  have  been
      extended  for  the  new  fiscal  year until such time as a new budget is
      adopted.
        c.   In the event the mayor  exercises  the  veto  power  pursuant  to

        2.  All  taxes  shall  be and become liens on the real estate affected
      thereby and shall be construed as and deemed to be  charged  thereon  on

      and  payable or at any time thereafter and, provided that payment of any
      installment or part thereof is made not later than fifteen days prior to

      amount so paid plus the discount provided for herein. Not later than the
      fifteenth day of May in each year, the banking commission shall transmit

      for the ensuing fiscal year. The council may adopt a discount  rate  for

      contrary, the discount allowed pursuant to such subdivision shall not be
      allowed to and including the fifteenth day  of  the  calendar  month  in
      which  an  installment  of taxes on real property would otherwise become
      due and payable  if  the  real  property  with  respect  to  which  such
      installment  is  paid  is  described in paragraph b of this subdivision.

      provided that, for this purpose, real property  held  in  a  cooperative
      form  of  ownership shall not be deemed to have an assessed valuation of
      more than forty thousand dollars if its assessed  valuation  divided  by
      the  number  of  dwelling  units contained therein equals forty thousand
      dollars or less, except that for the fiscal year commencing on the first
      day of July, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, and  for  each  fiscal  year
      thereafter,  such  property  shall  not  include  real  property with an
      assessed valuation of eighty thousand dollars or  less,  provided  that,
      for  this purpose, real property held in a cooperative form of ownership
      shall not be deemed to have an assessed valuation of  more  than  eighty
      thousand  dollars  if  its  assessed  valuation divided by the number of
      dwelling units contained therein equals eighty thousand dollars or less,
      and provided, further, that such real property  or  such  real  property
      held  in  a  cooperative form of ownership is classified as class one or
      class two in accordance with subdivision one of section eighteen hundred
      two of the real property tax law as such subdivision was  in  effect  on

Section 1523.
-------------

Section 1523. ::    
        
     
        §  1523.  Deposits. 1. The commissioner shall deposit all moneys which
      shall come into the commissioner's hands on account of the city  on  the
      day  of receipt thereof, or on the business day next succeeding, in such
      banks and trust companies as  shall  have  been  designated  as  deposit
      banks, but no amount shall be on deposit at any one time in any one bank
      or trust company exceeding one-half of the amount of the capital and net
      surplus  of such bank or trust company. The moneys so deposited shall be
      placed to the account of the commissioner who shall  keep  a  record  in
      which  shall  be entered the commissioner's accounts of deposits in, and
      moneys drawn from, the banks and trust companies in which  the  deposits
      shall  be  made.  Each such bank and trust company shall transmit to the
      comptroller a weekly statement of the moneys which shall be received and
      paid by it on account of the commissioner.
        2. The commissioner shall draw moneys of the city from said  banks  or
      trust  companies  only  by checks subjoined and attached to warrants and
      subscribed by the commissioner or by payment orders duly  authorized  by
      the comptroller and the commissioner, and no moneys shall be paid by any
      such banks or trust companies on account of the commissioner except upon
      such  checks  or orders; but this provision shall not apply to transfers
      of such funds from one city depository to another.
        3. The commissioner of finance, in  consultation  with  agency  heads,
      shall  by rule establish criteria by which to evaluate whether banks are
      using the means at their disposal to comply with the  embargo  on  trade
      and financial transactions with Burma and any other sanctions imposed by
      the  United  States  government  with regard to Burma, including but not
      limited to:
        a. withdrawal of operations from Burma;
        b. the denial of loans, letters  of  credit  and  other  correspondent
      banking services to Burmese entities;
        c. restrictions on the rescheduling of loans owed by Burmese entities,
      and  on  conversion  of  outstanding  loans to instruments having longer
      maturity dates; and
        d. divestiture of outstanding debt owed by Burmese entities.
        The commissioner shall, after offering banks  designated  pursuant  to
      section  fifteen hundred twenty-four and the public an opportunity to be
      heard, classify such banks according to such criteria and publish notice
      of such classification in the City Record. The commissioner may  at  any
      time,  upon  the  request  of a bank or at his or her own initiative and
      after offering the public and the  bank  an  opportunity  to  be  heard,
      change  the  classification of a bank and publish notice of such change.
      The  failure  of  a  bank  to  provide  information  requested  by   the
      commissioner  for  the purposes of this subdivision shall be grounds for
      the commissioner to lower the classification of the bank. When  choosing
      among  banks  offering  comparable  services  at a comparable cost, city
      agencies shall, in a manner consistent with  guidelines  established  by
      the  commissioner  of  finance,  seek to deposit or invest funds at, and
      obtain services from, the available banks that have received the highest
      classification.

      of  approving  or  denying  such  application  and,  if  designation  or

        2. a. No bank or trust company shall be designated  pursuant  to  this
      section unless:
        (1)  it  shall  agree  to  pay  into  the city treasury interest or to

      companies in the city by private persons or corporations; and
        (2)  it  shall  file  with  the  banking  commission  and city clerk a
      certificate signed by the president or other duly authorized officer  of
      such  bank setting forth that its board of directors has established and
      will adhere to a  policy  of  hiring  and  promotion  of  employees  and
      officers  without  regard  to  sex,  race,  color,  religion,  religious

      through  a  subsidiary  or  agent,  to  the  Government  of  Burma;  (a)
      advertising or otherwise promoting the sale,  outside  of  Burma,  coins

      New York.
        b. If the banking commission by a majority vote shall  decide  that  a
      requirement  or  condition  contained in paragraph a of this subdivision
      has been violated after giving the bank or trust company an  opportunity
      to  be heard, then upon thirty days' notice to the bank or trust company
      such designation may be  revoked.  The  banking  commission  shall  post
      notice  of  such  revocation  and  the reason for such revocation on the
      department's website.
        3. The commissioner may, with the approval of  the  comptroller,  make
      time  deposits of city moneys, for a period not to exceed six months, in
      any bank or trust company designated for deposit  of  city  funds.  Each
      such  bank  or  trust company shall before deposits are made, other than
      such as are of a temporary character  and  specifically  relate  to  the
      current  business  of the city, execute and file with the commissioner a
      bond to the city in such form and in such amount as  may  be  prescribed
      and approved by the commissioner and the comptroller for the safekeeping
      and  prompt  payment  of city moneys on demand with interest at the rate
      agreed upon and, as security for such  funds,  shall  deposit  with  the
      comptroller  outstanding  unmatured  obligations of the United States of

      and  principal by the United States of America acting through an agency,
      subdivision, department or division thereof, obligations of the state of
      New York or obligations of the city of New York, the value of  which  at
      the  existing  prices on the open market shall be equal to the estimated
    
      amount of the proposed deposit, for which the comptroller shall  deliver
      a certificate of deposit containing the condition of such bond.
        4.  On  the  withdrawal of all or a part of the funds deposited in any
      depository and a closing or depleting of the account thereof, or in  the
      event  of the deposit actually made being less than the estimated amount
      of such deposit, the commissioner and the comptroller shall  certify  to
      such  settlement  or depletion or difference and direct the surrender of
      the whole or a proportionate share of the securities so deposited to the
      owner or owners thereof.
