      payable at the commissioner's office as follows:
        1. a. With respect to all properties which are:
        (1) real property with an assessed valuation of forty thousand dollars
      or  less  on  such  assessment  roll,  except  such  property  held in a
      cooperative form of ownership;
        (2) real property held in a cooperative form  of  ownership,  provided
      that  the  assessed  valuation  on such assessment roll of such property
      divided by the number of dwelling units contained in such property shall
      equal forty thousand dollars or less;
        (3) for the fiscal year commencing on the first day of July,  nineteen
      hundred ninety-eight, and for each fiscal year thereafter, real property
      (i)  with  an  assessed  valuation of eighty thousand dollars or less on
      such assessment roll, except such property held in a cooperative form of
      ownership, and (ii) classified as class one or class two  in  accordance
      with  subdivision  one  of  section  eighteen  hundred  two  of the real
      property tax law as such subdivision was in  effect  on  January  fifth,
      nineteen hundred ninety-seven; and
        (4)  for the fiscal year commencing on the first day of July, nineteen
      hundred ninety-eight, and for each fiscal year thereafter, real property
      held in a cooperative form of ownership, provided that (i) the  assessed
      valuation on such assessment roll of such property divided by the number
      of dwelling units contained in such property shall equal eighty thousand
      dollars  or  less,  and (ii) such property is classified as class one or
      class two in accordance with subdivision one of section eighteen hundred
      two of the real property tax law as such subdivision was  in  effect  on
      January fifth, nineteen hundred ninety-seven; all taxes upon real estate
      for each fiscal year shall be due and payable in four equal installments
      each  of  which  shall  be  due and payable in such year as follows: the
      first payment on the first day of July, the second payment on the  first
      day  of  October,  the  third  payment  on the first day of January, the
      fourth payment on the first day of April. However, if  any  property  is
      acquired  by  the  city  in  condemnation proceedings, the proportionate
      share of the amount of the tax on such property which would be  due  and
      payable  on  the  next  succeeding  installment  date,  shall be due and
      payable on the date when the title to such property vests in the city.
        b. With respect to real property other than such  property  listed  in
      paragraph  a  of this subdivision one, for the fiscal year commencing on
      the first day of July nineteen hundred eighty-three and for each  fiscal
      year  thereafter:  all taxes upon real estate for each fiscal year shall
      be due and payable in two equal installments, the first of  which  shall
      be due and payable on the first day of July in such year, and the second
      of  which  shall  be due and payable on the first day of January in such
      year. However, if any property is acquired by the city  in  condemnation
      proceedings,  the  proportionate  share of the amount of the tax on such
      property  which  would  be  due  and  payable  on  the  next  succeeding
      installment date, shall be due and payable on the date when the title to
      such property vests in the city.
        2.  All  taxes  shall  be and become liens on the real estate affected
      thereby and shall be construed as and deemed to be  charged  thereon  on
      the  respective  days when they become due and payable, and not earlier,
      and shall remain such liens until paid.
        3. Any installment of taxes on real estate for any fiscal year may  be
      paid,  in  full  or in part, twenty-five days prior to the date on which
      the first installment for such fiscal year would  otherwise  become  due
    
      and  payable or at any time thereafter and, provided that payment of any
      installment or part thereof is made not later than fifteen days prior to
      the date that such installment would otherwise become  due  and  payable
      and  provided  that all prior installments shall have been paid or shall
      be paid at the same time, a discount shall be allowed from the  date  of
      payment  of  such  installment  or  part  thereof  to  and including the
      fifteenth day of the calendar month  on  which  such  installment  would
      otherwise  become due and payable at the rate fixed by the council and a
      receipt shall be furnished  to  the  extent  of  such  payment  and  the
      discount  thereon.  Upon payment of any such installment or part thereof
      prior to the date  such  installment  would  otherwise  become  due  and
      payable,  such  installment  or  part  thereof  shall  be deemed due and
      payable and shall be satisfied and extinguished to  the  extent  of  the
      amount so paid plus the discount provided for herein. Not later than the
      fifteenth day of May in each year, the banking commission shall transmit
      a  written  recommendation  to the council of the proposed discount rate
      for the ensuing fiscal year. The council may adopt a discount  rate  for
      such ensuing fiscal year on the fifth day of June preceding such ensuing
      fiscal  year or at any time thereafter. As used in this subdivision, the
      words "taxes on real estate," in the case of  utility  companies,  shall
      also include special franchise taxes.

      contrary, the discount allowed pursuant to such subdivision shall not be
      allowed to and including the fifteenth day  of  the  calendar  month  in
      which  an  installment  of taxes on real property would otherwise become
      due and payable  if  the  real  property  with  respect  to  which  such
      installment  is  paid  is  described in paragraph b of this subdivision.
      With respect to real property described in  paragraph  b,  the  discount

      provided that, for this purpose, real property  held  in  a  cooperative
      form  of  ownership shall not be deemed to have an assessed valuation of
      more than forty thousand dollars if its assessed  valuation  divided  by
      the  number  of  dwelling  units contained therein equals forty thousand
      dollars or less, except that for the fiscal year commencing on the first
      day of July, nineteen hundred ninety-eight, and  for  each  fiscal  year
      thereafter,  such  property  shall  not  include  real  property with an

      for  this purpose, real property held in a cooperative form of ownership

      thousand  dollars  if  its  assessed  valuation divided by the number of
      dwelling units contained therein equals eighty thousand dollars or less,
      and provided, further, that such real property  or  such  real  property
      held  in  a  cooperative form of ownership is classified as class one or
