Section 1515. ::    
        
     
        §  1515.    Statement  and estimate by the mayor.   a. The mayor shall
      prepare and submit to the council, immediately upon the  adoption  of  a
      single  budget  pursuant  to section two hundred fifty-four, a statement
      setting forth the amount of the budget as approved by  the  council  for
      the  ensuing  year and the mayor shall prepare and submit to the council
      not later than the fifth day of June an estimate of the probable  amount
      of (1) receipts into the city treasury during the  ensuing  fiscal  year
      from all the sources of revenue of the general fund and (2) all receipts
      other  than  those  of the general fund and taxes on real property.  The
      mayor may include in the statement  of  the  amount  of  the  budget  as
      approved by the council a confirmation of such amount, and thereby waive
      mayoral veto power pursuant to section two hundred fifty-five.
        b.    If,  as a result of the exercise of the mayor's veto pursuant to
      section two hundred fifty-five, the amount of the budget for the ensuing
      fiscal year differs from the  amount  of  the  budget  approved  by  the
      council  pursuant  to section two hundred fifty-four, not later than two
      days after the budget is finally adopted the  mayor  shall  prepare  and
      submit to the council a statement setting forth the amount of the budget
      for  the  ensuing  year,  and  the  council shall, if necessary, fix new
      annual tax rates pursuant to subdivision c of section one thousand  five
      hundred sixteen.
        c.    The  mayor, prior to establishing the final estimate of revenues
      for the ensuing fiscal year as required by this section, shall  consider
      any  alternative  estimate  of  revenues  which is submitted pursuant to
      subdivision d of this section and which is accompanied by a statement of
      the methodologies and assumptions upon which such estimate is  based  in
      such   detail   as  is  necessary  to  facilitate  official  and  public
      understanding of such estimates.
        d.  Any person or organization may, prior to the fifteenth day of May,
      submit to the mayor an official alternative  estimate  of  revenues  for
      consideration  by  the  mayor  in  accordance with subdivision c.   Such
      estimate shall be in a form prescribed by the mayor.
