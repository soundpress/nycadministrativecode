      written notice  to  the  commissioner,  designate  the  banks  or  trust
      companies in which all moneys of the city shall be deposited, and may by
      like  notice  in  writing  from  time to time change the banks and trust
      companies thus designated.  The  banking  commission  shall  notify  the
      council  within  thirty days of receiving an application for designation
      or redesignation, and shall also notify the council within  thirty  days
      of  approving  or  denying  such  application  and,  if  designation  or
      redesignation was denied, the basis for denial.
        2. a. No bank or trust company shall be designated  pursuant  to  this
      section unless:
        (1)  it  shall  agree  to  pay  into  the city treasury interest or to
      provide the city with equivalent value on the daily balances at  a  rate
      which  the  banking  commission shall negotiate according to the current
      rate of interest  upon  like  balances  deposited  in  banks  and  trust
      companies in the city by private persons or corporations; and
        (2)  it  shall  file  with  the  banking  commission  and city clerk a
      certificate signed by the president or other duly authorized officer  of
      such  bank setting forth that its board of directors has established and
      will adhere to a  policy  of  hiring  and  promotion  of  employees  and
      officers  without  regard  to  sex,  race,  color,  religion,  religious
      affiliation, national origin, disability, age, marital status, or sexual
      orientation, which certificate shall further set forth affirmatively the
      steps taken by the bank or trust company to implement said policy.
        (3) it does not provide the following  services,  either  directly  or
      through  a  subsidiary  or  agent,  to  the  Government  of  Burma;  (a)
      advertising or otherwise promoting the sale,  outside  of  Burma,  coins
      minted in Burma, (b) underwriting securities of the Government of Burma,
      or (c) making loans to the Government of Burma.
        (4)  it  has certified that neither it nor any of its affiliates is or
      will become a predatory lender or an affiliate thereof,  as  such  terms
      are  defined  in section 6-128 of the administrative code of the city of
      New York.
        b. If the banking commission by a majority vote shall  decide  that  a
      requirement  or  condition  contained in paragraph a of this subdivision
      has been violated after giving the bank or trust company an  opportunity
      to  be heard, then upon thirty days' notice to the bank or trust company
      such designation may be  revoked.  The  banking  commission  shall  post
      notice  of  such  revocation  and  the reason for such revocation on the
      department's website.
        3. The commissioner may, with the approval of  the  comptroller,  make
      time  deposits of city moneys, for a period not to exceed six months, in
      any bank or trust company designated for deposit  of  city  funds.  Each
      such  bank  or  trust company shall before deposits are made, other than
      such as are of a temporary character  and  specifically  relate  to  the
      current  business  of the city, execute and file with the commissioner a
      bond to the city in such form and in such amount as  may  be  prescribed
      and approved by the commissioner and the comptroller for the safekeeping
      and  prompt  payment  of city moneys on demand with interest at the rate
      agreed upon and, as security for such  funds,  shall  deposit  with  the
      comptroller  outstanding  unmatured  obligations of the United States of
      America, or any obligation fully guaranteed or insured  as  to  interest
      and  principal by the United States of America acting through an agency,
      subdivision, department or division thereof, obligations of the state of
      New York or obligations of the city of New York, the value of  which  at
      the  existing  prices on the open market shall be equal to the estimated
    
      amount of the proposed deposit, for which the comptroller shall  deliver
      a certificate of deposit containing the condition of such bond.
        4.  On  the  withdrawal of all or a part of the funds deposited in any
      depository and a closing or depleting of the account thereof, or in  the
      event  of the deposit actually made being less than the estimated amount
      of such deposit, the commissioner and the comptroller shall  certify  to
      such  settlement  or depletion or difference and direct the surrender of
      the whole or a proportionate share of the securities so deposited to the
      owner or owners thereof.
