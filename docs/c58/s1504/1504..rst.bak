      law, the department shall perform those functions and operations of  the
      city  which  relate  to  the administration and collection of all taxes,
      assessments and charges imposed by the city, the collection  of  arrears
      due  the  city  and  all  other  sums  due the city, including state and
      federal aid, the receipt and safekeeping of all  moneys  paid  into  the
      city  treasury  and  payment  of  money  out  of  the  treasury, and the
      administration and management of certain trust funds held by  the  city,
      including, without limitation, the following:
        1.  Real  property  assessment.  With  respect  to  real  property tax
      assessment, the department shall assess for  taxation  all  the  taxable
      real  property  in  the  city  and  prepare  the  assessment  rolls. The
      commissioner shall appoint, within the appropriation therefor,  as  many
      assessors as shall be necessary for the performance of such functions in
      accordance with the provisions of this chapter.
        2.  Tax  collection. a. The department shall administer all excise and
      non-property taxes imposed or administered by the city. With respect  to
      such taxes, the department shall have the power to settle and adjust all
      claims in favor of or against the city and, except with respect to cases
      within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  tax  appeals tribunal established by
      section one hundred sixty-eight of this charter, to make  determinations
      in  contested cases. For such purposes, the commissioner or his delegate
      may, except with respect to cases within the jurisdiction  of  such  tax
      appeals tribunal, hold hearings and administer oaths.
        b.  The  department  shall  collect all real property taxes, water and
      sewer charges, other assessments and arrears against real  property  and
      all other taxes, assessments and arrears payable to the city.
        c. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law
      to  the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority to
      compromise any excise or nonproperty taxes or annual  vault  charges  or
      any  warrant or judgment for excise or nonproperty taxes or annual vault
      charges administered by  the  commissioner,  and  the  civil  penalties,
      interest  and additions to tax or charge in connection therewith, if the
      tax debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy,  or  is  shown  by  proofs
      submitted to be insolvent, but the amount payable in compromise shall in
      no  event  be  less  than  the amount, if any, recoverable through legal
      proceedings, and provided that where the  amount  owing  for  excise  or
      nonproperty  taxes  or  annual  vault  charges,  exclusive  of any civil
      penalties, interest and additions to tax or charge, or  the  warrant  or
      judgment,  exclusive  of  any civil penalties, interest and additions to
      tax  or  charge,  is  more  than  one  hundred  thousand  dollars,  such
      compromise  shall  be  effective  only when approved by a justice of the
      supreme court.
        d. Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law
      to the contrary, the commissioner shall have the exclusive authority  to
      compromise  civil liability, with such qualifications and limitations as
      may be established pursuant  to  such  rules  as  the  commissioner  may
      prescribe,  where  such liability arises in connection with an excise or
      nonproperty tax or annual vault charge administered by the commissioner,
      at any time prior to the time the tax or administrative  action  becomes
      finally  and  irrevocably  fixed and no longer subject to administrative
      review. Upon acceptance of an offer in compromise by  the  commissioner,
      the  matter  may  not  be  reopened  except  upon  a  showing  of fraud,
      malfeasance or misrepresentation of a  material  fact.  The  corporation
      counsel  may  compromise  any  such liability after reference to the law
      department for prosecution or defense at any time prior to the time  the
      tax  or  administrative  action  taken  by  the  department is no longer
      subject to administrative or judicial review. Whenever a  compromise  is
    
      made  by  the department of any such liability, there shall be placed on
      file in the office of the commissioner the opinion of  the  commissioner
      or  a  deputy  commissioner, with reasons therefor, with a statement of:
      (i)  the  amount of excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge and
      any other issues that may be the subject of such  compromise,  (ii)  the
      amount  of  interest,  additions to the tax or penalty imposed by law on
      the taxpayer or other persons against whom the administrative action was
      taken  by  the  department,  and  (iii)  the  amount  actually  paid  in
      accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  compromise.  Notwithstanding  the
      preceding sentence, no such opinion shall be required  with  respect  to
      the  compromise of any civil liability in which the unpaid amount of the
      excise or nonproperty tax or annual vault charge that was the subject of
      the administrative action (including any interest, additions to tax,  or
      penalty) is less than twenty-five thousand dollars.
        e.  Nothing in paragraph c or d of this subdivision shall be construed
      to diminish or otherwise impair any power of  the  department  exercised
      pursuant to any other provision of law.
        3. Deposit and payment of moneys in the city treasury; trust funds.
        a.  The  department  shall  have the power and duty to provide for the

      comptroller and countersigned by the commissioner.
        b. The department shall administer and manage all trust funds received
      or held by the city pursuant to a judgment, decree or order of any court
      or under section eleven hundred twenty-three of  the  surrogate's  court
      procedure  act,  section  ninety-nine-m  of  the  general municipal law,
      sections eighty-seven and three-h of the social services  law,  sections
      four hundred twenty-six and four hundred thirty-two of the real property
      law,  section two hundred four of the lien law, and section five hundred
      fifty-three of the county law, and in such administration  it  shall  be
      deemed  to  be  acting  in  a  fiduciary  capacity. The department shall
      provide for the receipt and safekeeping of all such moneys of the  trust
      funds  held  by the city and disburse the same on warrants signed by the
      comptroller.
        c. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary and unless
      otherwise determined by the court which directed payment of the funds in
      the first instance, for purposes of administering and managing the trust
      funds, other than cemetery trust funds, enumerated  in  paragraph  b  of
      this  subdivision,  whenever  the department is permitted or required by
      law to deposit such funds in a savings bank,  trust  company,  bank,  or
      banking  association,  or  to  invest such funds in its discretion or in
      legal investments for trustees or  savings  banks,  the  department  may
      combine  all such trust funds into one or more common trust funds, which
      may be deposited in  such  savings  banks,  trust  companies,  banks  or
      banking associations as are designated by the state comptroller pursuant
      to  section one hundred eighty-two of the state finance law, or invested
      in legal investments for trustees or savings  banks.  Such  funds,  when
      deposited in a savings bank, trust company, bank or banking association,
      may  be  placed  in  demand  or  time  deposit  accounts, including time
      certificates of deposit, and such deposits shall be either insured by  a
      federal   deposit  insurance  corporation  or  fully  collateralized  by
      securities acceptable to the state comptroller.
        (ii)  The  department  may  retain  trust  funds  temporarily  pending
      investment  or  deposit  or to meet cash requirements in connection with
      the deposit or withdrawal of such funds, but such temporary retention of
      trust funds shall not deprive any owner or  beneficiary  of  any  income
      therefrom  to which the owner or beneficiary would otherwise be entitled
      by law.
    
        (iii) When trust  funds  are  received  by  the  department  it  shall
      forthwith  open  and maintain a separate ledger account for each action,
      proceeding or matter and shall keep an  exact  accounting  of  all  such
      funds  and  all  income  earned  thereon  in  such  manner  as the state
      comptroller may prescribe.
        4. Parking violations bureau. The department shall operate and control
      the  parking  violations  bureau.  The  commissioner  shall  appoint the
      director of the bureau, deputy  director  and  all  other  officers  and
      employees of the bureau, and hearing examiners.
