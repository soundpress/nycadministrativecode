      jurisdiction.
        e.  The board shall establish minimum standards for the care, custody,
      correction, treatment, supervision, and discipline of all  persons  held
      or  confined  under  the  jurisdiction  of  the department; and it shall
      promulgate such minimum standards in rules and regulations after  giving
      the  mayor  and commissioner an opportunity to review and comment on the
      proposed standards, or amendments or additions to such standards.
        f. The board shall establish procedures for the hearing of grievances,
      complaints or requests for assistance (1) by or on behalf of any  person
      held  or confined under the jurisdiction of the department or (2) by any
      employee of the department. The board,  or  by  written  designation,  a
      member  of the board or the executive director, may conduct hearings, or
      study  or  investigate  any  matter  within  the  jurisdiction  of   the
      department, and the board may make recommendations and submit reports of
      its findings to the appropriate authorities.

      persons,  and  conduct  public  or   private   hearings,   studies   and
    
      investigations.  The  board  may  institute  proceedings  in  a court of
      appropriate  jurisdiction  to  enforce  its  subpoena  power  and  other
