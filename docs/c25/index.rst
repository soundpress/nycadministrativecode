*§ 22-103 Grant of lands under water within the projected boundary lines of streets.* ::


a. To the end that the city may make needful provisions for navigation, intercourse and commerce of the city and adequately to develop and secure the same there is hereby granted in fee to the city, in all the public streams, rivers, sounds, bays and waters of all descriptions at any and all places within the city or adjoining the limits of the city, all and singular the property, estate, right, title and interest of the people of the state of New York, in, to, of, and concerning such lands under water, as are embraced within the projected boundary lines of any street intersecting the shore line, and which street is in public use or which may be hereafter opened for public use entending from high-water mark out into such streams, rivers, sounds, bays and waters so far (and limits in existing grants to the contrary) as the city shall now or at any time hereafter in the opinion of the board of estimate or the commissioner of ports and trade require the same for ferries, public wharves, docks, piers, bulkheads, basins, slips or other public structures, adjuncts and facilities for navigation and commerce. This grant shall include the right to reclaim such lands from such waters, and also all riparian rights and all rents, issues and profit of the premises herein granted. The commissioner of the state department of general services, from time to time, shall convey or patent the lands therein granted to the city for such purposes as and whenever required by the commissioner of ports and trade.

b. Subdivision a of this section shall not impair or affect any existing valid private rights, or the existing riparian rights of owners of private property, or the lawful rights of private owners of docks, piers and other structures in the city or any part thereof.






*§ 22-104 Lands under water not within the projected boundary lines of streets; patenting of.* ::


a. Patents of land under water within the city shall be made only to the city or to the riparian proprietor. Where, pursuant to section seven hundred five of the charter or section 22-132 of this chapter, a plan or plans for the construction of docks between street intersections shall be projected, the commissioner of ports and trade, with the approval of the board of estimate, may make application to the commissioner of the state department of general services for a grant of lands under water for that purpose. Such state commissioner thereupon shall give notice to the riparian proprietor before taking action in the matter and shall then make such grant to the city for the purposes specified in section 22-103 of this subchapter. Such grant, however, shall be subject to all the rights of the riparian proprietor, and before the city shall construct such public wharves or other structures in front of the land of such riparian proprietor, the city shall make just compensation to such proprietor for the value of all the riparian rights.

b. Where application is made to the commissioner of the state department of general services by the riparian proprietor for a grant of soil or lands under water within the city, such state commissioner shall give notice thereof to the commissioner of ports and trade who shall examine into such application and certify to such state commissioner whether in his or her opinion the granting of the same will conflict with the rights of the city or be otherwise injurious to the public interests of the city. Such grant, if made, shall be confined to lands under water in front of such riparian proprietor and such state commissioner may insert such terms and conditions in the grant as are recommended by the commissioner of ports and trade and as will protect the public interests of the city in respect to navigation and commerce. The validity of any such grant or patent may be judicially determined in an action brought by and in the name of the city.

If the mayor approve such agreement, the commissioner shall take from the owners at such price, the necessary conveyances and covenants for vesting such wharf property or uplands in, and assuring the same to the city of New York forever, and such owner shall be paid such price by the city. If, however, the commissioner shall determine that the city should acquire such wharf property or uplands by condemnation, without first attempting to agree with the owners thereof for its purchase, the commissioner may, with the approval of the mayor direct the corporation counsel to take legal proceedings to acquire the same for the city. Thereupon, the corporation counsel shall take the same proceedings to acquire such wharf property or uplands as are provided for the taking of private property in the city for public streets or places, and the provisions of subchapter one of chapter three of title five of the code are hereby made applicable, as far as may be necessary, in any legal proceeding taken under this section. Before any such proceeding shall be instituted, a statement shall be furnished to the mayor of the valuation of the real property to be acquired as assessed for purposes of taxation. The title to such property shall vest in the city upon the date of the filing of the survey or map showing the real property to be acquired subdivided into parcels corresponding with the separate ownerships thereof in the office of the clerk of the county where such proceeding is pending; and all of the rights, title and interest of any and all of the owners or persons interested in such wharf property or uplands, shall cease and determine and be extinguished at such time. All the awards made in such proceedings for the value of property acquired or interests extinguished shall draw interest from the time of the vesting of the title in the city.

b. The commissioner, with the approval of the board of estimate, may agree, license and permit private owners of any wharf property, to make the necessary improvements upon their property, so as to conform to the water front plan during the period which shall intervene prior to the extinguishment of such private ownership by the city. Such improvements shall be made by such owners under the supervision of or by the commissioner, as may be agreed upon, at the cost and expense of such private owners, in the first instance, and upon such reasonable terms as to reimburse such private owners for such improvements, and as to wharfage and other riparian rights thereon and therefrom, as may be agreed upon.






*§ 22-106 Wharf property; acquisition; public hearing required.* ::


The mayor, prior to approving or authorizing the acquisition of wharf property or uplands, or directing the vesting in the city of any title thereto, may hold a public hearing and shall refer any such proposed acquisition to the appropriate agency pursuant to the provisions of chapter eight of the charter. Public notice of any hearing held by the mayor shall be given by publication for six consecutive days in the City Record, not less than seven, nor more than thirty days before such public hearing. Such publication shall contain in addition to such information as the commissioner may deem proper, a description of the property to be affected by the order to acquire such property, a statement by the mayor of the date, time and place of such public hearing, and an abstract of the recommendation of the commissioner in relation to such vesting of title.






*§ 22-107 Fixing the high water line.* ::


a. The commissioner, by agreement with the upland owner, may fix, determine upon and establish the line of high water in front of the property of such upland owner upon such line or lines as the commissioner shall deem best adapted to the improvement of the water front.

b. Such agreement may provide for the sale and conveyance to the upland owner of lands under water inside of such line, and for the purchase from such upland owner of lands outside of such line, or for the exchange of lands under water inside of such line for lands outside of such line. Such agreement for sale and conveyance, together with a map showing the lines so fixed, determined upon and established shall be transmitted to the department of city planning pursuant to the provisions of sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and one hundred ninety-nine of the charter. If such agreement involves the purchase or acquisition of such lands, the agreement, together with a map showing the lines so fixed, determined upon and established shall be transmitted to the mayor. Upon approval by the board of estimate of such agreement for sale and conveyance and upon approval of such agreement for purchase or acquisition by the board of estimate and by the mayor such sale and conveyance shall be made upon such terms and conditions as the board shall deem proper, and such purchase or exchange shall be made upon such terms and conditions as the board and the mayor shall deem proper.






*§ 22-108 Sinking ships; placing at wharf property prohibited.* ::


It shall be unlawful to place any vessel, craft or structure which is sinking or is in such condition that there is danger of it sinking or stranding, at any wharf property. Violation of this section shall be a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars and not less than ten dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than six months and not less than ten days, or by both, on complaint of the commissioner. One-half of any such fine shall be paid to the person or persons giving information which shall lead to the conviction of any person violating this section.






*§ 22-109 Removal of trucks, merchandise and vessels.* ::


Where any wharf property or marginal street shall be encumbered or obstructed in its free use or navigation by merchandise or material not affixed to such wharf property or marginal street, or by an automobile, wagon, truck or cart, or by any floating, stranded or sunken vessel or craft, and the owner, consignee or person in charge thereof shall fail to remove the same when directed by an order issued by the commissioner, pursuant to section seven hundred four of the charter, the commissioner may employ such labor and equipment as may be necessary to carry out such order. The commissioner may store such merchandise, material, automobile, wagon, truck, cart, vessel or craft in a warehouse or other suitable place at the expense of the owner. Such owner, consignee or person in charge of the merchandise, material, automobile, wagon, truck, cart, vessel or craft so removed or stored may redeem the same upon payment to the commissioner of the amount of all expenses actually and necessarily incurred in effecting such removal, together with any charges for storage. The commissioner shall be deemed a creditor of such owner, consignee or person in charge and each of them for the amount of the expenses so incurred and the commissioner may maintain an action against them, or any of them, to recover the same.

Whenever such merchandise, material, automobile, wagon, truck, cart, vessel or craft shall remain unclaimed for thirty days after service of such order on such owner, consignee or person, the commissioner may then sell the same at pubic auction to the highest bidder, after advertisement for one week in the City Record. The commissioner shall deduct the expenses which have been incurred from the proceeds of such sale and shall hold the remainder of such proceeds in trust for such owner, consignee or person for twelve months. If such remainder is then unclaimed, it shall be paid into the general fund. Any excess of expenses which have been incurred in the removal, storage, advertisement and sale of such merchandise, material, automobile, wagon, truck, cart, vessel or craft over such proceeds of sale shall be recoverable from such owner or owners of the same in an action maintained by the commissioner.

   3. All such expenses shall constitute a lien upon the premises when the amount thereof shall have been definitely computed as a statement of account by the department and the department shall cause to be filed in the office of the city collector an entry of the account stated in the book in which such charges against the premises are to be entered. Such lien shall have a priority over all other liens and encumbrances on the premises except for the lien of taxes and assessments.

Such notice shall have stamped or printed thereon a reference to this section.

   5. If such charge is not paid within thirty days from the date of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to receive interest thereon at the rate of interest applicable to such property for a delinquent tax on real property to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry.

   7. (1) In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i) the lawfulness of the work done; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this paragraph.

      (2) No such challenge may be made except by (a) the owner of the property, or (b) a mortgagee or lienor whose mortgage or lien would but for the provisions of this section have priority over the department's lien.

      (3) An issue specified in subparagraph one which was decided or could have been contested in a prior court proceeding to secure a court order pursuant to subdivision e of this section shall not be open to reexamination, but if any mortgagee or lienor of record was not served with an order of the commissioner pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision c and with notice of such proceeding, his or her mortgage or lien shall have the same priority over the lien of the department that it would have had but for the provisions of this section.

   8. In addition to establishing a lien, the department may recover such expenses and interest by bringing an action against the owner. The institution of such action shall not suspend or bar the right to pursue any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such debt.

c. Any contract for private operation may provide for the construction of warehouses, factories or other buildings on land owned by the city, which warehouses, factories or buildings shall, during construction and at all times thereafter, be the property of the city. The contract may provide for the amortization of the cost of such warehouses, factories or buildings out of receipts from their operation, or out of receipts from the operation of all the terminal facilities included in such contract during the term thereof, and may provide for the payment by the city of any unamortized portion of the actual cost plus a reasonable contractor's profit, not to exceed fifteen per centum at the termination of the contract, or on the exercise of an option to recapture reserved in the contract. The contract may provide for the payment to the city for the privilege of operating such warehouses, factories, or other buildings so constructed, either (1) a fixed annual sum; or (2) a share of the gross receipts; or (3) a share in the net profits.

d. Such contract may contain any other provision not inconsistent with this section which the board of estimate may deem necessary or desirable for the protection of the interests of the city.

Chapter 1-a: Fulton Fish Market Distribution Area and Other Seafood Distribution Areas
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 22-201 Legislative findings.* ::


The council hereby finds that the fulton fish market, the center of New York's wholesale seafood industry located in lower Manhattan, has for decades been corruptly influenced by organized crime; that organized crime's corrupting influence over certain functions in the market, including the unloading and loading functions, has resulted in the commission of numerous crimes and wrongful acts there, including but not limited to physical violence or threats of violence, property damage, and thefts; that organized crime's corrupting influence over the market has fostered and sustained a cartel that has forced seafood suppliers and truckers to use particular unloading crews at fixed prices in an anticompetitive scheme that has been censured by a federal judge; that organized crime's corrupting influence has resulted in retailers parking on city streets and city property nevertheless having to pay high fees to private loading crews whose principal function has been to provide "security" for those vehicles and their contents while retailers have purchased fish in the crime-ridden market area; and that these corrupting influences have further resulted in higher prices for wholesale seafood than would otherwise have to be paid in the absence of this activity. The council further finds that despite the repeated efforts of law enforcement to prosecute crimes there and the presence of a court-appointed administrator for the market, the problem of organized crime corruption in the market has persisted. The council further finds that the market's businesses, including wholesalers, seafood deliverers, unloaders and loaders, have not been effectively regulated by the city in the past under existing laws and regulations governing public markets, even though they often operate on city property, albeit without leases, licenses and registration. The council fur-ther finds that, in the absence of an effective regulatory scheme, wholesalers have established a "gray market" in tenancies at rates in excess of those being paid to the city and have thus deprived the public of its rightful return on city property, and further, that unscrupulous businesses have taken advantage of this absence of regulation to engage in fraudulent practices, such as the creation of "phantom wholesalers" whose businesses disappear from the market before payment can be obtained from them for seafood they have received from suppliers, and that such practices have discouraged suppliers from utilizing the market area The council therefore finds and declares that in order to provide for the more efficient and orderly conduct of business in the market area, to ensure that any such activities are lawfully conducted, to promote the economic vitality of the market and to protect the public interest, it is necessary for the commissioner of small business services to have expanded authority to license and/or register businesses in the market area and to regulate the conduct of such businesses. In particular, the council finds that, in order to achieve these objectives, the commissioner of small business services should be authorized to issue requests for licensing proposals to provide unloading and loading services in the market area and, at his or her discretion, issue one or more unloading and loading licenses based on the review and evaluation of responses received pursuant to such requests. In the event that no appropriate responses are received to such requests, the commissioner should be authorized to arrange for the department of small business services itself to perform unloading or loading services or to arrange that they be performed by a contractor or a designee of the department. The council recognizes that complaints have been made about the conduct of seafood distribution activities outside the market area and finds further that the conditions which have given rise to corruption in the market area can exist in other areas where there are wholesale seafood businesses or concentrations of such businesses. The council also recognizes that representatives of such businesses have threatened to move their operations elsewhere and that some may relocate to other parts of the city. The council thus finds and declares that it is also necessary for the commissioner of small business services to have authority to regulate seafood distribution in areas of the city outside the market area in which such seafood businesses may concentrate. Application of this chapter will enhance the city's ability to address organized crime corruption and to protect consumers and the many honest business persons who do business in or with the market or at other seafood distribution areas. It is thus the council's intent to empower the city to have greater regulatory authority over the conduct business in the market and in other seafood distribution areas.

In the event that the department determines to provide such services, the provisions of subdivisions a through g of this section shall not apply.

j. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require the department to authorize any party to use property owned by the city in the market area for the purpose of conducting a loading business.






*§ 22-207 Conduct of loading businesses.* ::


a. The commissioner may establish by rule such measures as he or she deems appropriate and necessary to ensure the orderly and lawful conduct of loading businesses in the fulton fish market distribution area. Such measures may include the establishment of a voucher system under which (i) loaders are prohibited from accepting cash payments for performing loading services and (ii) persons wishing to have loading services performed for them may purchase vouchers from the market manager and present them to loaders in payment for loading services. Such vouchers shall thereafter be redeemed by the loading business for payment from the market manager.

b. Such measures may also include, but shall not be limited to: (i) appropriate insurance requirements; (ii) prohibitions on interference with vehicles lawfully parked in the market area; (iii) designation of loading areas in the market area, a requirement that a loading business obtain a lease or an occupancy permit for the occupancy of property owned by the city when a designated loading area is located on such property and the establishment of a fee for such permit; (iv) designation of hours during which loading services may be performed; (v) provisions prescribing maintenance and availability of records for inspection by the market manager or the commissioner; and (vi) appropriate insurance and bonding requirements.






*§ 22-208 Loading and unloading services provided by the department.* ::


a. Notwithstanding any provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the commissioner may determine that the public interest will be best protected by the department providing loading and/or unloading services in the market. Such determination may also be made:

   (i) in the event that suspensions or revocations of unloading business licenses or loading business licenses have resulted in an insufficiency of such services in the market area; or

   (ii) following the review of licensing proposals to conduct an unloading business made pursuant to section 22-204 of this chapter or of licensing proposals to conduct a loading business made pursuant to section 22-206 of this chapter, based upon a finding that there are an insufficient number of business entities submitting proposals for unloading or loading licenses, as the case may be, (1) whose principal or principals meet the requirements of good character, honesty and integrity set forth under this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto; or (2) which are able to provide unloading or loading services, as the case may be, in a manner consistent with the safe, lawful, orderly and efficient operation of the market area at rates which are fair and reasonable to customers.

b. Where the commissioner has made a determination pursuant to this section, the department may provide unloading or loading services, as the case may be, within the market area. Such services shall be provided in accordance with all rules governing the conduct of unloading or loading services prescribed under section 22-205 and section 22-207 of this chapter, other than insurance and bonding requirements.

c. During any period in which the department provides services in the market area under this section, it shall be unlawful for any other person or business entity to provide or perform or offer to provide or perform the same or similar services in the market area; provide, however, that where the department does not provide all unloading or loading services, as the case may be, in the market area, an unloading business or a loading business that possesses a valid license to conduct such business may continue to operate.

d. At any time following the commencement of a department service under this section, the commissioner may solicit interest in order to determine whether there are business entities interested in providing unloading or loading services, as the case may be, in the market area who meet the requirements of this chapter and can substitute for the services being provided by the department. The commissioner may thereupon issue a request for licensing proposals pursuant to the provisions of section 22-204 or section 22-206 of this chapter and issue a license pursuant to such sections. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision, the commissioner may at any time during a period in which the department is proving services pursuant to this section consider an application for an unloading business and/or loading business license from a business entity interested in providing such service. This subdivision shall not apply when the department has determined, pursuant to the provisions set forth in subdivision g of section 22-206, that the department itself shall perform loading services on city owned property in the market area.

e. For the purposes of this section, services provided by the department shall include those services provided by a designee of the department, an entity under contract to the department, or by a combination thereof.






*§ 22-209 Wholesaler registration and stand permits required.* ::


a. It shall be unlawful for any business entity to conduct a wholesale seafood business in the fulton fish market distribution area without having first registered with and obtained a registration number from the commissioner. A registration application shall be submitted by a wholesale seafood business upon a form prescribed by the commissioner containing such information as the commissioner shall require by rule and shall be signed by all the principals of such wholesaler. A registration number shall not be transferable. A wholesaler shall not sublease or assign to another wholesaler the premises, or any portion thereof with respect to which a wholesaler has registered his or her wholesale seafood business, unless such proposed sublessee or assignee has registered with and obtained a wholesaler registration number from the commissioner. A wholesale seafood business shall, in accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 22-223 of this chapter, inform the commissioner of any change in the ownership composition of such business, or of the addition or deletion of any principal at any time subsequent to registration.

b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner may, when there is reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals, employees or agents of a wholesaler lack good character, honesty and integrity, require that any or all of such principals be fingerprinted and provide to the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision a of section 22-216 of this chapter. The commissioner may thereafter, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to register such wholesaler for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.

   (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a wholesaler, the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals, employees or agents of such wholesaler do not possess good character, honesty and integrity, the commissioner may require that any or all of such principals be fingerprinted and provide the background information required by subdivision a of section 22-216 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, revoke the registration of such wholesaler for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.

c. No wholesaler shall place seafood on the street without a stand permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter. A stand permit shall not be transferable. Except where the occupancy of a city street under a stand permit is authorized under the terms of a lease with the city of adjacent premises, the commissioner may set a charge to a wholesaler for such occupancy under a stand permit calculated upon the square footage of the area authorized to be used in such permit.

d. A wholesaler shall not allow any other person to place seafood in the space for which such stand permit has been issued, except that a wholesaler may, on a temporary basis, permit the use of such space by another registered wholesaler who has received a shipment of seafood that cannot be accommodated in the space from which such registered wholesaler operates. No fee may be charged for such temporary use and any such use shall be reported as soon as is practicable to the market manager in accordance with rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to this chapter.

e. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions c and d of this section, the holder of a stand permit may, after having first obtained the prior written approval of the commissioner, allow no more than one other registered wholesaler at any one time to place seafood on other than a temporary basis in up to forty-nine percent of the space for which such stand permit was issued. The holder of such permit may charge a fee for the use of such space. Such fee shall be calculated by multiplying the charge paid by the permit holder to the city for such permit by the ratio of the amount of space being used to the amount of space for which such permit was issued and the ratio of the time for which such space will be used to the period of time for which such permit was issued; except that a holder of a stand permit may charge a fee exceeding the charge based on such calculation, provided that the holder of such permit shall remit to the city an amount equal to seventy-five percent of the difference between the actual fee charged and the charge that would result from such calculation. A copy of the written agreement allowing the use of such space shall be filed with the market manager. Such agreement shall specify the amount of space and the period for which use of such space is authorized and the fee being charged.

f. A stand permit shall cease to be valid upon the expiration, revocation or during a period of suspension of the registration of the wholesale seafood business to which such stand permit has been issued. However, where the holder of a stand permit has, pursuant to the provisions of subdivisions d or e of this section, allowed another registered wholesaler to use a portion of the space for which such permit was issued such other registered wholesaler shall be permitted to continue to conduct business in such space during such period of suspension.

g. The market manager shall maintain and publish a list of all wholesalers in the market area who are registered with the market manager and who possess stand permits together with the registration numbers of such wholesalers and the numbers of such permits. The market manager shall make such list available to suppliers, shippers and truckers and shall, upon request, verify to suppliers, shippers and truckers whether such business entity is currently registered with the commissioner and/or possesses a valid stand permit.






*§ 22-210 Conduct of wholesale seafood businesses.* ::

(iii) requirements for the disposal of waste and other sanitary measures;

(iv) requirements that wholesalers comply with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations regarding the handling of seafood;

(v) appropriate insurance and bonding requirements; and (vi) provisions prescribing maintenance and availability of records for inspection by the commissioner or the market manager pertaining to, without limitation, the purchase, receipt, sale and delivery of seafood and the verification of ownership interests of the wholesale business, its principals, employees and agents.






*§ 22-211 Registration required for seafood delivery business.* ::


a. It shall be unlawful to conduct a seafood delivery business in the fulton fish market distribution area without having first registered such business with the commissioner and obtained a registration number from the commissioner. A registration application shall be submitted by a seafood delivery business upon a form prescribed by the commissioner containing such information as the commissioner shall require by rule and shall be signed by all the principals of such seafood delivery business. The market manager may require that seafood deliverers affix a sticker or decal containing such registration number to their delivery vehicles. A seafood delivery registration number or sticker or decal shall not be transferable.

b. (i) Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, the commissioner may, when there is reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals, employees or agents of a seafood deliverer lack good character, honesty and integrity, require that any or all of such principals be fingerprinted and provide to the commissioner the information set forth in subdivision a of section 22-216 of this chapter, and may, after notice and the opportunity to be heard, refuse to register such seafood deliverer for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.

   (ii) If at any time subsequent to the registration of a seafood deliverer, the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that any or all of the principals, employees or agents of a seafood deliverer lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the commissioner may require that any or all of such principals be fingerprinted and provide the background information required by subdivision a of section 22-216 of this chapter and may, after notice and the opportunity for a hearing, revoke the registration of such seafood deliverer for the reasons set forth in subdivision b of such section.






*§ 22-212 Conduct of seafood delivery business.* ::

a. The commissioner shall by rule establish fees for the issuance and renewal of registrations and of licenses pursuant to this chapter in amounts sufficient to compensate the city for the administrative expense of issuing or renewing a registration or license and the expense of inspections and other activities related thereto. A license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for two years. A business entity that is licensed pursuant to this chapter shall provide the commissioner in a form prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to rules promulgated under this chapter with notice of at least ten business days of the proposed addition of a new principal to such business entity. The commissioner may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor. Except where the commissioner determines within such period, based on information available to him or her, that the addition of such new principal may have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter, the licensee may add such new principal pending the completion of review under section 22-216 of this chapter. The licensee shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commissioner that the addition of such new principal pending completion of review under section 22-216 of this chapter would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If upon the completion of such review, the commissioner determines that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the license shall cease to be valid unless such principal divests his or her interest; or discontinues his or her involvement in the business of such licensee, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.

b. The commissioner shall be authorized to extend the term of the license for an additional one year period at his or her discretion and shall establish an additional fee therefor.

c. A registration issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for two years.

The commissioner may waive or shorten such period upon a showing that there exists a bona fide business requirement therefor.

Such wholesale business or market business shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate to the commissioner that the addition of such new principal pending completion of such review would not have a result inimical to the purposes of this chapter. If the commissioner determines, following completion of such review, that such principal lacks good character, honesty and integrity, the registration shall cease to be valid if the commissioner determines that such principal has failed to divest his or her interest, or to discontinue his or her involvement in the business of such business or both, as the case may be, within the time period prescribed by the commissioner.

A pass shall be in the possession of such person at all times when such person is in the market and shall be worn and visible in compliance with rules promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to section 22-266 of this chapter. The department or, at the direction of the department, a designee of the department, shall be authorized to deny a visitor pass and entry into a market to any person whose presence may constitute a threat to the orderly operation of a market or who has failed to provide the identifying information required by the commissioner or the designee of the commissioner. The provisions of this section shall not apply to any public wholesale market to which access by the public has routinely been permitted without control, restriction or other regulation for no less than a year directly preceding the effective date of this provision; provided, however, that the commissioner may apply such provisions upon a determination that an emergency exists that necessitates the temporary restriction of access to such a market. For the purposes of this section, a "designee of the department" shall mean an agency of the city or, in the discretion of the commissioner, a wholesaler cooperative or similar organization. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the denial of a visitor pass to a representative of a labor union or labor organization solely because such person seeks to engage in the lawful exercise within a public wholesale market of an activity protected under the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 141, et seq., including, but not limited to, the lawful picketing of a place of business of a wholesale business or market business in connection with a legitimate labor dispute, except as may otherwise be prohibited by law. However, such person shall not impede any reasonable measure undertaken by a police officer or authorized employee of the department intended to control vehicle and pedestrian traffic within such public wholesale market or upon any street, avenue, parkway, plaza, square or other public place designated as a public market. The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of labor relations prior to reaching any determination that an activity be a representative of a labor union or organization is not lawful under the National Labor Relations Act.






*§ 22-256 Fees.* ::


The commissioner shall by rule establish fees for photo identification cards, for registration and the renewal of registration, and for visitor passes issued pursuant to this chapter in amounts sufficient to compensate the city for the administrative expense of issuance of such photo identification cards, of registration and the inspections and other activities related thereto, and of issuance of visitor passes. Such rule may provide that a designee of the department perform administrative functions related to the issuance of photo identification cards or the issuance of visitor passes and that such designee may, with the approval of the commissioner, impose a fee for the performance of such functions. For the purposes of this section "designee of the department" shall mean an agency of the city or, in the discretion of the commissioner, a wholesaler cooperative or similar organization. Registration pursuant to this chapter shall be valid for three years. A wholesale business or a market business shall be responsible for the payment of any fee imposed by this section with respect to an employee of such business or any person seeking to become an employee of such business.

b. In any civil action or administrative proceeding against an employee of a wholesale business or market business for a violation of this chapter or any rules promulgated pursuant thereto, it shall be an affirmative defense that the employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment when the action or actions constituting the alleged violation were committed and that such action or actions were committed pursuant to an instruction given to such employee by such wholesale business or market business or by any principal, officer or agent of such business, provided, however, that this subdivision shall not be applicable to a violation of section 22-252 or section 22-262 of this chapter and any rules promulgated pursuant thereto.






*§ 22-258 Penalties.* ::


a. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision b of this section, any person who violates any provision of this chapter or any of the rules promulgated hereto shall be liable for a civil penalty which shall not exceed ten thousand dollars for each such violation. Such civil penalty may be recovered in a civil action or in a proceeding before the environmental control board or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

b. (i) Any person who violates the requirement to obtain a photo identification card or to register a business contained in section 22-252 or section 22-253 of this chapter or who violates section 22-262 of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a criminal fine for each violation of not more than ten thousand dollars for each day of such violation or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both; and any such person shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each day of such violation to be recovered in a civil action or proceeding before the environmental control board or other administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.

   (ii) The corporation counsel is authorized to commence a civil action on behalf of the city for injunctive relief to restrain or enjoin any violation of this chapter and for civil penalties.

Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the emergency suspension of a photo identification card of an employee who is a member of a labor union or labor organization solely for the reason that such person is seeking or has sought to engage in the lawful exercise within a public wholesale market of an activity protected by the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 141, et seq. The commissioner shall consult with the commissioner of labor relations prior to reaching any determination that an activity by a representative of a labor union or labor organization is not lawful under the National Labor Relations Act.

b. An officer of a labor union or labor organization required to be registered with the commissioner pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall inform the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the commissioner, of:

   (i) all criminal convictions, in any jurisdiction, of such officer;

   (ii) any pending civil or criminal actions to which such officer is a party; and

   (iii) any criminal or civil investigation by a federal, state, or local prosecutorial agency, investigative agency or regulatory agency, in the five year period preceding the date of registration pursuant to subdivision a of this section and at any time subsequent to such registration, wherein such officer has (A) been the subject of such investigation, or (B) received a subpoena requiring the production of documents or information in connection with such an investigation. Any material change in the information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported to the commissioner within thirty calendar days thereof.

c. The commissioner may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, disqualify an officer of a labor union or labor organization from holding office when such person: (i) has failed, by the date prescribed by the commissioner, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision b of this section; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action against such officer for a crime which bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which case the commissioner may defer a determination until a decision has been reached by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a crime which, under the standards set forth in article 23-A of the correction law, bears a direct relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, including the specific duties and responsibilities necessarily related to the union office; the bearing, if any the criminal offense or offenses will have on the fitness of the officer to perform such responsibilities; the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses; the seriousness of the offense or offenses; and any information produced by the person, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to his or her rehabilitation or good conduct; (iv) has committed a racketeering activity or associated with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limitied to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to the commissioner any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that such information does not reflect adversely upon the officer's good character, honesty and integrity. If the commissioner determines pursuant to this subdivision that there are sufficient grounds to disqualify a person from holding office in a labor union or labor organization, the commissioner shall suspend such person from holding office pending final determination and, in the event such person is disqualified, such suspension shall continue pending resignation or vacatur of or removal from office.

e. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary, the provisions of this section shall apply to any labor union or labor organization representing or seeking to represent employees of business required to be licensed or registered pursuant to chapter 1-A of this title in the fulton fish market distribution area or other seafood distribution area.

Any material change in information reported pursuant to this subdivision shall be reported to the commissioner within thirty calendar days thereof. The commissioner may, if he or she has reasonable cause to believe that such an officer of a trade association lacks good character, honesty and integrity, require that such officer be fingerprinted by a person designated by the commissioner for such and pay a fee to be submitted to the division of criminal justice for the purpose of obtaining criminal history records.

c. The commissioner may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, disqualify a person from holding office in a wholesale trade association when such person: (i) has failed, by the date prescribed by the commissioner, to be fingerprinted or to provide truthful information in connection with the reporting requirements of subdivision b of this section; (ii) is the subject of a pending indictment or criminal action against such officer for a crime which bears a relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market, in which case the commissioner may defer a determination pending a determination by the court before which such action is pending; (iii) has been convicted of a crime which, under the standards of article 23-A of the correction law, bears a relationship to the lawful and orderly operation of the market; (iv) has committed a racketeering activity or associated with a person who has been convicted of a racketeering activity, including but not limited to the offenses listed in subdivision one of section nineteen hundred sixty-one of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization statute (18 U.S.C. § 1961, et seq.) or of an offense listed in subdivision one of section 460.10 of the penal law, as such statutes may be amended from time to time, when the officer knew or should have known of such conviction; or (v) has associated with any member or associate of an organized crime group as identified by a federal, state or city law enforcement or investigative agency when the officer knew or should have known of the organized crime associations of such person. An officer required to disclose information pursuant to subdivision a of this section may submit to the commissioner any material or explanation which such officer believes demonstrates that the officer does not lack good character, honesty and integrity. Upon receiving an order of the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision disqualifying a person from holding office in a wholesale trade association, such person shall vacate such office or, if such person fails to vacate such office within the time period specified by the commissioner, such association shall remove such person forthwith from such office. Failure of such person to vacate such office within the time specified by the commissioner shall subject such person to the penalties set forth in subdivision a of section 22-258 of this chapter or to injunctive action by the city pursuant to subdivision c of such section. An office-holder who has been disqualified pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision may be excluded by the commissioner from the market.
