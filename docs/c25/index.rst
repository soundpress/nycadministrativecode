*§ 23-403 Powers of commissioner.* ::


a. The commissioner may issue and renew permits under this chapter based upon a determination, at his or her discretion, that issuance or renewal of a permit would be in the best interests of the city, provided that:

   1. no permit shall be issued or renewed unless the applicant holds a franchise granted by the city to install, operate and maintain public pay telephones on, over and under the streets and other inalienable property of the city;

      (ii) in the event that the installation of a public pay telephone requires affixing the phone to a building facade or other private property, no permit shall be issued or renewed without the written consent of the building owner.

      (iii) in the event the installation of a public pay telephone is to be accomplished in a manner other than as set forth in subsection (i) and (ii) of this section, but requires access through an existing conduit or other opening on a building facade or other private property, or such installation is to be made within six feet of a building line, no permit shall be issued or renewed without the written consent of the building owner or the commercial lessee who shall certify (aa) that the building owner has authorized the lessee to grant such consents; and (bb) that the lessee has provided the building owner or its authorized agent with written notification by certified mail, of the granting of such consent, the name and address of the owner of the public pay telephone and the location of such public pay telephone in relation to the building.

g. An owner who submits an application for a public pay telephone permit containing a certification made by a commercial lessee pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of paragraph 2 of subdivision a of section 23-403 of this chapter, knowing that such certification contains a false statement or false information, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

h. The commissioner may request the corporation counsel to institute any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary to restrain, correct or abate a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

i. 1.
