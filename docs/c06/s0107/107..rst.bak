Section 107. ::    
        
     
        §  107.  Budget modification.   a.   Subject to the quarterly spending
      allotments  and  aggregate  position  and    salary  limits  established
      pursuant  to section one hundred six, and to other applicable provisions
      of this charter, of the civil service law and of other law,  changes  in
      schedules,  within  units  of  appropriation, may be made by the head of
      each agency.  Any such changes shall be reported to the  mayor  and  the
      comptroller      before  the  effective  date thereof, and shall be made
      available for public inspection under reasonable terms and conditions.
        b.  The mayor during any fiscal year may transfer part or all  of  any
      unit of appropriation to another unit of appropriation, except that when
      any  such  transfer (1) shall be from one agency to another or (2) shall
      result in any unit of appropriation having been increased  or  decreased
      by  more  than  five  per  cent  or fifty thousand dollars, whichever is
      greater, from the budget as adopted for such unit of appropriation,  the
      mayor  shall  notify  the council of the proposed action.  Within thirty
      days after the first stated meeting of the council following the receipt
      of such notice,    the  council  may  disapprove  the  proposed  action;
      provided, however, that the mayor may recommend such a transfer if it is
      related  to  an appropriation included in the budget pursuant to section
      one hundred two only  with  the  concurrence  of  the  relevant  borough
      president;  and  a borough president may make such a recommendation with
      regard to such an appropriation if it is concurred in by the  mayor  and
      does not include a reduction in an appropriation other than one included
      in  the budget pursuant to section one hundred two on the recommendation
      of such borough president.  Written notice of any transfer  pursuant  to
      this  subdivision  shall  be  given  to  the  comptroller  and  shall be
      published in the City Record as soon as possible after such transfer.
        c.  The provisions of this section shall not be  deemed  to  authorize
      any transfer from appropriations required by law.
        d.  The council may during any fiscal year transfer part or all of any
      unit  of  appropriation  within  the  council appropriation to any other
      council unit of appropriation for any of its programs or projects or for
      any other purpose, solely by adoption of a  council  resolution.    Each
      such  transfer  shall be published in the City Record and written notice
      thereof shall be given to the mayor and to the comptroller not less than
      ten days before the effective date thereof.
        e.  The procedures and required approvals  pursuant  to  sections  two
      hundred  fifty-four,  two hundred fifty-five, and two hundred fifty-six,
      without regard to the dates specified therein, shall be followed in  the
      case  of:  (1)  any  proposed  amendment  to  the  budget respecting the
      creation of new units of appropriation; or (2) the appropriation of  new
      revenues  from  any  source  except  for revenues from federal, state or
      private sources  in  regard  to  the  use  of  which  the  city  has  no
      discretion;  provided,  however, that the mayor shall give notice to the
      council of the receipt and proposed utilization of any such revenues; or
      (3) the proposed use by the  city  of  previously  unappropriated  funds
      received  from  any  source.    Any  request  by the mayor respecting an
      amendment to the budget that involves an increase in the budget shall be
      accompanied by a statement of the source of current  revenues  or  other
      identifiable  and  currently available funds required for the payment of
      such additional amounts.
