        §  100.  Format  of expense budget departmental estimates, preliminary
      expense budget, and executive expense budget.   a.   The expense  budget
      departmental   estimates,   the  preliminary  expense  budget,  and  the
      executive expense budget for each year shall consist of  proposed  units
      of   appropriation   for   personal   service   and  proposed  units  of
      appropriation for other than personal service  for  the  ensuing  fiscal
      year.
        b.  Each  agency  head, for the departmental estimates, and the mayor,
      for the executive budget, shall submit (i) a statement of the impact  of
      the  proposed  units  of  appropriation  on  the level of services to be
      provided during the ensuing fiscal year and (ii)  a written response  to
      each  of  the  expense  budget  priorities  included in   each community
      board's statement of budget  priorities  submitted  in  accordance  with
      section  two  hundred thirty of this charter,  including the disposition
      of each such priority and a meaningful explanation of  any  disapprovals
      contained in such estimates or budget.
        c.  Each  proposed  unit  of  appropriation shall represent the amount
      requested for personal service or for other than personal service for  a
      particular program, purpose, activity or institution; provided, however,
      that  a  single  unit  of appropriation for personal service or a single
      unit of appropriation for other than personal service may represent  the
      amount requested for more than one particular program, purpose, activity
      or  institution if the council has adopted, on the recommendation of the
      mayor, or if the council has adopted on its own initiative and the mayor
      has approved, a resolution setting forth the names, and a  statement  of
      the  programmatic  objectives,  of  each  program,  purpose, activity or
      institution to be included in  such  a  single  unit  of  appropriation.
      Copies  of  such  resolutions  must  be  included  as an appendix to any
      preliminary budget, executive budget, and adopted budget to  which  they
      apply.    If,  in  accordance with such a resolution, a proposed unit of
      appropriation for other than personal service shall represent the  total
      amount  requested  for  other  than  personal  service for more than one
      proposed unit of appropriation for personal service, the amount of  such
      unit of appropriation for other than personal service which is allocable
      to  each  unit  of appropriation for personal service shall be set forth
      for informational purposes at the end of each such unit of appropriation
      for personal service.   If, in accordance  with  such  a  resolution,  a
      proposed  unit of appropriation for personal service shall represent the
      total amount requested for personal service for more than  one  proposed
      unit  of  appropriation  for  other than personal service, the amount of
      such unit of appropriation for personal service which  is  allocable  to
      each  unit of appropriation for other than personal service shall be set
      forth for informational purposes  at  the  end  of  each  such  unit  of
      appropriation for other than personal service.
        d.   Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the departmental
      estimates, the preliminary expense  budget  and  the  executive  expense
      budget   shall  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  the  programmatic
      objectives of the program, purpose, activity or institution involved.
        e.  Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the  departmental
      estimates  and  the  executive budget shall be   supported by line items
      showing how the total amount of such unit is determined.
        f.  The departmental estimates shall be in such form and contain  such
      further  information as may be required by the mayor or by law and shall
      be public records which shall at all reasonable times be open to  public
      inspection.
        g.    For each city agency that has local or borough service districts
      within community districts and boroughs, the departmental estimates  and
      the  executive  budget,  where practicable, shall contain a statement of
    
      proposed direct expenditures in each  such  service  district  for  each
      requested unit of appropriation.
        h.   The departmental estimates and the executive expense budget shall
      include a contract budget prepared in accordance with the provisions  of
      section one hundred four.
