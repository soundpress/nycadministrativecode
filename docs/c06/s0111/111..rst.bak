        §   111.  Self-dealing  among  members  of  the  governing  boards  of
      charitable institutions. a. Any charitable  institution  which  receives
      any  payment from the New York city charitable institutions budget shall
      pass and implement by-laws which will:
        1. Require disclosure to the agency responsible for the administration
      of charitable institutions budget and approval by  such  agency  of  the
      material  terms  of  any  contract  or  transaction, direct or indirect,
      between an institution and  any  member  of  its  governing  board,  any
      partnership  of  which he or she is a member or any corporation in which
      he or she holds ten per cent or more of the outstanding common stock.
        2. Preclude any member of the governing board of any institution  from
      sharing,  participating  or  benefiting,  directly or indirectly, in the
      proceeds from any contract  or  transaction  entered  into  between  the
      institution and any third party unless such participation or benefit has
      been  approved  in  advance by the agency and the governing board of the
      institution has  approved  the  transaction  by  a  two-thirds  majority
      excluding the vote of member to be benefited.
        3.  Require each member of its governing board to submit to the agency
      each year a disclosure statement  including  such  member's  name,  home
      address,  principal  occupation  and  business interests from which such
      member or such member's spouse or domestic partner received income equal
      to or greater than ten per cent of their aggregate gross  income  during
      the previous year.
        b.  At the discretion of the agency, any payment or any portion of any
      payment may be withheld from any institution which has  failed  to  pass
      and implement such by-laws.
