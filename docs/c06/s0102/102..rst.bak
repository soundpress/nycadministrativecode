        §  102.  Expense  budget borough allocations. a. Definition.  The term
      "discretionary increases" as used in this section shall mean  an  amount
      equal to the total amount of general fund expenditures of city funds and
      state  and  federal funds over which the city has substantial discretion
      proposed to be made in the ensuing fiscal year for  all  purposes  other
      than  debt  service minus the sum of the following items as certified by
      the mayor, including related fringe benefits:
        (1)  all such proposed expenditures which are necessary to continue to
      operate current programs and provide current services at the  levels  at
      which  they  were authorized to be operated or provided, pursuant to the
      expense budget for the  current  year  as  adopted  in  accordance  with
      section  two  hundred fifty-four and two hundred fifty-five or at levels
      not exceeding such levels;
        (2) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
      or services which are projected to be necessary to accommodate projected
      increases  in  the  caseload    of  current programs or to accommodate a
      portion of such projected increases;
        (3) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
      or  services which are projected to be necessary as a result of federal,
      state or local laws or judicial decisions  which  require  increases  in
      benefit levels, service levels, or similar matters;
        (4)  all  proposed  increases in such expenditures for new programs or
      new services required by federal, state or local  law  to  be  initiated
      during the ensuing fiscal year; and
        (5)    all  proposed  expenditures,  in  excess  of  the  expenditures
      specified in paragraph one of this subdivision, which are  necessary  to
      continue to operate current programs and provide current services at the
      levels at which they are currently authorized to be operated or provided
      pursuant  to  the  expense  budget  for  the current year as modified in
      accordance with section one hundred seven, excluding the portion of such
      excess  which  is  attributable  to  budget  modifications  adopted   in
      accordance with such section which were not necessary to (i) continue to
      operate  programs  and  provide services at the level at which they were
      authorized in the expense budget  for  the  current  year  as  initially
      adopted, (ii) accommodate actual but unanticipated caseload increases in
      such  programs,  or (iii) accommodate actual but unanticipated increases
      in spending of the types referred to in paragraphs  three  and  four  of
      this subdivision, and excluding that portion of any expenditure increase
      which  was  financed  by  a  decrease  in  any appropriations originally
      included in the executive expense budget for the current year to pay for
      a discretionary increase.
        b. Borough allocation.   Five percent  of  the  total  amount  of  the
      discretionary  increases  which  the  mayor  includes  in  the executive
      expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year shall be allocated among  the
      boroughs  by  a formula based on  factors related to population and need
      and shall be known as the  expense  budget  borough  allocation.    Such
      formula  shall  be  established by local law, but in any fiscal year for
      which no such local  law  is  effective,  such  expense  budget  borough
      allocation  shall  be  allocated  among the boroughs on the basis of the
      average of (i) each borough's share of the total population of the city,
      (ii) each borough's share of the total population of the city below  one
      hundred  twenty-five  percent  of  the  poverty  level,  and  (iii) each
      borough's share of the total land area of the  city.    Such  a  borough
      allocation  shall  be reduced by any amounts necessary, in excess of the
      amounts available pursuant to section one hundred two-a, to pay for  the
      operating  costs,  as  certified  in  accordance  with the provisions of
      subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision c of section two  hundred
      eleven,  of    capital  project  constructed  with funds recommended for
    
      appropriation by the borough president in accordance with the provisions
      of  section two hundred eleven.
        c.   Preliminary  borough  allocations;    initial  borough  president
      notification.   Concomitantly with the  submission  of  the  preliminary
      expense  budget,  the  mayor  shall inform each borough president of the
      portion of the executive expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year  and
      for  the  three  subsequent  fiscal  years that, pursuant to the formula
      required by subdivision b of this section, would be  allocated  to  each
      borough  if  the  amount  of the discretionary increases for the ensuing
      fiscal year  and for the three subsequent years were  the  same  as  the
      amounts  projected  by the mayor, in accordance with section one hundred
      one, to be available for such purposes in such years.    The  amount  of
      such  portion  shall  be known as the preliminary expense budget borough
      allocation.
        d. Borough president proposals.   Each borough president,  during  the
      consultations  required  by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit
      to the mayor, in such  form  as  the  mayor  shall  prescribe,  proposed
      appropriations  for  the  expense  budget  not  exceeding such borough's
      allocation of the expense budget borough allocation as certified by  the
      mayor  to  the borough presidents during such consultations.  The timing
      of such certification shall allow sufficient time for such consultations
      and for  meeting  the  deadlines  established  by  section  two  hundred
      forty-nine.    The  mayor  shall  include  such  proposed appropriations
      without modification in the executive expense budget in accordance  with
      the  provisions  of  subdivision  two  of  section  one  hundred  three;
      provided, however, that the mayor may also  include  such  comments  and
      recommendations  relating  to  such proposed appropriations as the mayor
      may deem proper.
