      requested for personal service or for other than personal service for  a
      particular program, purpose, activity or institution; provided, however,
      that  a  single  unit  of appropriation for personal service or a single
      unit of appropriation for other than personal service may represent  the
      amount requested for more than one particular program, purpose, activity
      or  institution if the council has adopted, on the recommendation of the

      for personal service.   If, in accordance  with  such  a  resolution,  a
      proposed  unit of appropriation for personal service shall represent the
      total amount requested for personal service for more than  one  proposed

      forth for informational purposes  at  the  end  of  each  such  unit  of
      appropriation for other than personal service.

      budget   shall  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  the  programmatic
      objectives of the program, purpose, activity or institution involved.
        e.  Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the  departmental
      estimates  and  the  executive budget shall be   supported by line items
      showing how the total amount of such unit is determined.

      be public records which shall at all reasonable times be open to  public
      inspection.

      within community districts and boroughs, the departmental estimates  and
      the  executive  budget,  where practicable, shall contain a statement of

      requested unit of appropriation.
        h.   The departmental estimates and the executive expense budget shall
      include a contract budget prepared in accordance with the provisions  of

Section 102. ::    
        
     
        §  102.  Expense  budget borough allocations. a. Definition.  The term
      "discretionary increases" as used in this section shall mean  an  amount
      equal to the total amount of general fund expenditures of city funds and
      state  and  federal funds over which the city has substantial discretion
      proposed to be made in the ensuing fiscal year for  all  purposes  other
      than  debt  service minus the sum of the following items as certified by
      the mayor, including related fringe benefits:
        (1)  all such proposed expenditures which are necessary to continue to
      operate current programs and provide current services at the  levels  at
      which  they  were authorized to be operated or provided, pursuant to the
      expense budget for the  current  year  as  adopted  in  accordance  with
      section  two  hundred fifty-four and two hundred fifty-five or at levels
      not exceeding such levels;
        (2) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
      or services which are projected to be necessary to accommodate projected
      increases  in  the  caseload    of  current programs or to accommodate a
      portion of such projected increases;
        (3) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
      or  services which are projected to be necessary as a result of federal,
      state or local laws or judicial decisions  which  require  increases  in
      benefit levels, service levels, or similar matters;
        (4)  all  proposed  increases in such expenditures for new programs or
      new services required by federal, state or local  law  to  be  initiated
      during the ensuing fiscal year; and
        (5)    all  proposed  expenditures,  in  excess  of  the  expenditures
      specified in paragraph one of this subdivision, which are  necessary  to
      continue to operate current programs and provide current services at the
      levels at which they are currently authorized to be operated or provided
      pursuant  to  the  expense  budget  for  the current year as modified in
      accordance with section one hundred seven, excluding the portion of such
      excess  which  is  attributable  to  budget  modifications  adopted   in
      accordance with such section which were not necessary to (i) continue to
      operate  programs  and  provide services at the level at which they were
      authorized in the expense budget  for  the  current  year  as  initially
      adopted, (ii) accommodate actual but unanticipated caseload increases in
      such  programs,  or (iii) accommodate actual but unanticipated increases
      in spending of the types referred to in paragraphs  three  and  four  of
      this subdivision, and excluding that portion of any expenditure increase
      which  was  financed  by  a  decrease  in  any appropriations originally
      included in the executive expense budget for the current year to pay for
      a discretionary increase.
        b. Borough allocation.   Five percent  of  the  total  amount  of  the
      discretionary  increases  which  the  mayor  includes  in  the executive
      expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year shall be allocated among  the
      boroughs  by  a formula based on  factors related to population and need
      and shall be known as the  expense  budget  borough  allocation.    Such
      formula  shall  be  established by local law, but in any fiscal year for
      which no such local  law  is  effective,  such  expense  budget  borough
      allocation  shall  be  allocated  among the boroughs on the basis of the
      average of (i) each borough's share of the total population of the city,
      (ii) each borough's share of the total population of the city below  one
      hundred  twenty-five  percent  of  the  poverty  level,  and  (iii) each
      borough's share of the total land area of the  city.    Such  a  borough
      allocation  shall  be reduced by any amounts necessary, in excess of the
      amounts available pursuant to section one hundred two-a, to pay for  the
      operating  costs,  as  certified  in  accordance  with the provisions of
      subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision c of section two  hundred
      eleven,  of    capital  project  constructed  with funds recommended for
    
      appropriation by the borough president in accordance with the provisions
      of  section two hundred eleven.
        c.   Preliminary  borough  allocations;    initial  borough  president
      notification.   Concomitantly with the  submission  of  the  preliminary
      expense  budget,  the  mayor  shall inform each borough president of the
      portion of the executive expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year  and
      for  the  three  subsequent  fiscal  years that, pursuant to the formula
      required by subdivision b of this section, would be  allocated  to  each
      borough  if  the  amount  of the discretionary increases for the ensuing
      fiscal year  and for the three subsequent years were  the  same  as  the
      amounts  projected  by the mayor, in accordance with section one hundred
      one, to be available for such purposes in such years.    The  amount  of
      such  portion  shall  be known as the preliminary expense budget borough
      allocation.
        d. Borough president proposals.   Each borough president,  during  the
      consultations  required  by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit
      to the mayor, in such  form  as  the  mayor  shall  prescribe,  proposed
      appropriations  for  the  expense  budget  not  exceeding such borough's
      allocation of the expense budget borough allocation as certified by  the
      mayor  to  the borough presidents during such consultations.  The timing
      of such certification shall allow sufficient time for such consultations
      and for  meeting  the  deadlines  established  by  section  two  hundred
      forty-nine.    The  mayor  shall  include  such  proposed appropriations
      without modification in the executive expense budget in accordance  with
      the  provisions  of  subdivision  two  of  section  one  hundred  three;
      provided, however, that the mayor may also  include  such  comments  and
      recommendations  relating  to  such proposed appropriations as the mayor
      may deem proper.

Section 104.
------------

Section 104. ::    
        
     
        §  104.  Contract  budget.  a. Each contract budget shall set forth by
      agency each major category of contractual  services  and  each  multiple
      purpose  category  of  contractual services for which appropriations are
      being proposed.
        b. Each agency head for the departmental estimates, the mayor for  the
      executive budget, and the council for the adopted budget by a resolution
      adopted  with  the  budget,  shall  certify  that each major category of
      contractual services is presented as such and that no  multiple  purpose
      category contains a major category of contractual services.
        c. For purposes of this section
        1. the term "major category" shall mean:
        (a) a programmatic category related to a major service provided by the
      agency  or  a  major  responsibility  of the agency regardless of dollar
      amount; or

      requirement; or
        (c) a subcategory of those categories set forth in subparagraph a or b
      of this paragraph where the dollar amount constitutes a major commitment
      of city funds; or
        (d) a category established by the council as a major category pursuant
      to subdivision f of this section; or
        (e) a category certified by the mayor as a major category.
        2. the term "multiple purpose category" shall mean:
        (a)  groupings  of  contractual services for related purposes, none of
      which individually constitute  a  major  category,  but  which  together
      facilitate  public  understanding of contractual spending provided by an
      agency; or
        (b) a grouping of unrelated contractual services,  which  individually
      do  not  constitute  a  major  category, and which are not appropriately
      grouped with other contractual spending of the agency.
        3. the term "contractual services" shall mean technical, consultant or
      personal services provided to the city through contracts.
        d. Major categories. Each major category of contractual services shall
      be accompanied by a detailed description of the programmatic  objectives
      of the category, the number of contracts estimated to be included in the
      category and the proposed appropriations for that category.
        e.  Multiple  purpose categories. All other contractual services shall
      be aggregated in multiple  purpose  categories.  Each  multiple  purpose
      category shall be accompanied by the number of contracts estimated to be
      included  in  the  category and the supporting schedules identifying the
      purposes and amounts involved in sufficient detail to allow the  council
      to  certify  that  the  category  does  not  contain major categories of
      contractual services.
        f. Change of categories. The council may alter  any  category  in  the
      contract  budget  submitted  by  the  mayor,  or  change  any  terms and
      conditions of it. The mayor shall  provide  sufficient  information  and
      technical  assistance to allow the council to certify each category as a
      major or  multiple  purpose  category.  The  mayor  may  disapprove  any
      alteration  by the council. The mayor's disapproval may be overridden by
      a two-thirds vote of all of the members of the council.
        g. Adoption of contract budget. The council  may  increase,  decrease,
      add or omit any amount in the contract budget as submitted by the mayor,
      or  change  any terms and conditions of the amount in that category. The
      mayor may disapprove any increase or addition  to  the  amounts  in  the
      categories,  or  any  change  in  any term and condition of the contract
      budget. The mayor's disapproval may be overridden by a  two-thirds  vote
      of all of the members of the council.
    
        h.  Modification of terms and conditions. All spending for contractual
      services shall be in accordance with the terms  and  conditions  of  the
      contract  budget  as  adopted; provided, however, that during any fiscal
      year the mayor shall notify the council of any proposed modification  of
      such a term or condition. Within thirty days of the first stated meeting
      of  the  council  following  the receipt of such notice, the council may
      disapprove the proposed notification.

      account  or under other appropriate designation to enable the department
      of citywide administrative services to maintain a stock in  anticipation
      of  requirements  or  to  provide  services, utilities or facilities for
      joint use by more than one agency or institution.

Section 106. ::    
        
     
        §  106.  Expense  budget  administration.    a.    Except as otherwise
      provided by law,  no  unit  of  appropriation  shall  be  available  for
      expenditure  by  any  city agency until schedules   fixing positions and
      salaries  and  setting  forth  other  expenses  within  the   units   of
      appropriation  are  established  pursuant  to  the  adopted  budget, the
      administration of which is subject to the provisions  of  this  chapter,
      the civil service law, and other applicable law.
        b.  The  mayor  shall  establish  and  may  modify for each agency (1)
      quarterly spending allotments for each unit  of  appropriation  and  (2)
      aggregate  position  and  salary  limits for each unit of appropriation,
      which shall be made available for public review  upon  adequate  notice.
      No  agency  shall  expend  any  sum in excess of such quarterly spending
      allotments, or exceed aggregate position and salary limits.   The  mayor
      may  set  aside  specified sums as necessary reserves which shall not be
      included in the quarterly spending  allotments  until  released  by  the
      mayor.    Each  agency  shall  administer  all  monies  appropriated  or
      available for programs and purposes of the  agency  in  accordance  with
      quarterly  allotment  plans  proposed  by  the  agency  and  approved or
      modified by the mayor.   Each such plan shall  set  forth  by  units  of
      appropriation  for  the quarter of the fiscal year during which it is to
      remain in effect:  (1) rates of expenditures for personal  services  and
      other  than  personal  services;  (2)  ceilings  on  the total number of
      uniformed, civilian and pedagogical employees; and (3) the total  amount
      of funds to be spent or committed by the agency during such quarter.
        c.    The  mayor shall keep informed, during the course of each fiscal
      year, of the progress of expenditures and the receipt of  revenues,  and
      it  shall  be  the duty of all agencies, when requested by the mayor, to
      supply all information needed for this purpose.
        d.  The mayor may assume direct responsibility for the  administration
      of  the  schedule  required  to  be filed by the agency head pursuant to
      subsection a of this section when in the  mayor's  judgment  the  fiscal
      condition  of  the  city  so requires or when an agency (1) is expending
      funds in excess of the quarterly spending allotments or (2) is otherwise
      not complying with spending allotments or aggregate position and  salary
      limits   or  (3)  is  not  maintaining  adequate  accounts  pursuant  to
      requirements of this charter.
        e. Whenever the mayor determines, pursuant to the provisions  of  this
      charter  or  other  relevant  statutes,  that  the  full  amount  of any
      appropriation should not be available for expenditure during the  fiscal
      year,  the  mayor shall notify the council of such determination and the
      implications and consequences of those impoundments for  service  levels
      and programmatic goals affected. The mayor shall respond in writing to a
      request by the council for an explanation of why an appropriation should
      not be expended.
        f.  1.  Within  thirty  days  of the adoption of the executive expense
      budget, the head of each agency responsible  for  one  or  more  of  the
      services  listed  in  paragraph four of this subdivision shall submit to
      each borough president, a plan for the allocation within the borough  of
      the  personnel  and  resources appropriated for each such service in the
      borough.
        2. Within thirty days of receiving such a plan, the borough  president
      may  propose  a  reallocation  of the personnel and resources within the
      borough. Such proposed reallocations shall be implemented by the agency,
      unless the head of the  agency  objects,  in  writing,  to  the  borough
      president.  If such an objection is submitted, the borough president may
      submit a revised reallocation proposal to the agency head which shall be
      implemented by the agency head provided that no  such  modification  may
    
      increase  or  decrease  the  personnel  or  resources  allocated  to any
      community district for such service by more than five percent.
        3.  If,  during  the  course  of  the fiscal year, however, a material
      reallocation of personnel or resources within a borough  is  anticipated
      by  an  agency  head  to  be necessary for any of the services listed in
      subdivision four,  the  agency  head  shall  consult  with  the  borough
      president prior to the implementation of any such reallocation.
        4.  The  services  covered  by  this  subdivision  shall  include  the
      following services and  any  additional  services  identified  for  this
      purpose  by  the mayor: local parks services, street cleaning and refuse
      collection, housing code enforcement, highway and street maintenance and

Section 107. ::    
        
     
        §  107.  Budget modification.   a.   Subject to the quarterly spending
      allotments  and  aggregate  position  and    salary  limits  established
      pursuant  to section one hundred six, and to other applicable provisions
      of this charter, of the civil service law and of other law,  changes  in
      schedules,  within  units  of  appropriation, may be made by the head of
      each agency.  Any such changes shall be reported to the  mayor  and  the
      comptroller      before  the  effective  date thereof, and shall be made
      available for public inspection under reasonable terms and conditions.
        b.  The mayor during any fiscal year may transfer part or all  of  any
      unit of appropriation to another unit of appropriation, except that when
      any  such  transfer (1) shall be from one agency to another or (2) shall
      result in any unit of appropriation having been increased  or  decreased
      by  more  than  five  per  cent  or fifty thousand dollars, whichever is
      greater, from the budget as adopted for such unit of appropriation,  the
      mayor  shall  notify  the council of the proposed action.  Within thirty
      days after the first stated meeting of the council following the receipt
      of such notice,    the  council  may  disapprove  the  proposed  action;
      provided, however, that the mayor may recommend such a transfer if it is
      related  to  an appropriation included in the budget pursuant to section
      one hundred two only  with  the  concurrence  of  the  relevant  borough
      president;  and  a borough president may make such a recommendation with
      regard to such an appropriation if it is concurred in by the  mayor  and
      does not include a reduction in an appropriation other than one included
      in  the budget pursuant to section one hundred two on the recommendation
      of such borough president.  Written notice of any transfer  pursuant  to
      this  subdivision  shall  be  given  to  the  comptroller  and  shall be
      published in the City Record as soon as possible after such transfer.
        c.  The provisions of this section shall not be  deemed  to  authorize
      any transfer from appropriations required by law.
        d.  The council may during any fiscal year transfer part or all of any
      unit  of  appropriation  within  the  council appropriation to any other
      council unit of appropriation for any of its programs or projects or for
      any other purpose, solely by adoption of a  council  resolution.    Each
      such  transfer  shall be published in the City Record and written notice
      thereof shall be given to the mayor and to the comptroller not less than
      ten days before the effective date thereof.
        e.  The procedures and required approvals  pursuant  to  sections  two
      hundred  fifty-four,  two hundred fifty-five, and two hundred fifty-six,
      without regard to the dates specified therein, shall be followed in  the
      case  of:  (1)  any  proposed  amendment  to  the  budget respecting the
      creation of new units of appropriation; or (2) the appropriation of  new
      revenues  from  any  source  except  for revenues from federal, state or
      private sources  in  regard  to  the  use  of  which  the  city  has  no
      discretion;  provided,  however, that the mayor shall give notice to the
      council of the receipt and proposed utilization of any such revenues; or
      (3) the proposed use by the  city  of  previously  unappropriated  funds
      received  from  any  source.    Any  request  by the mayor respecting an
      amendment to the budget that involves an increase in the budget shall be
      accompanied by a statement of the source of current  revenues  or  other
      identifiable  and  currently available funds required for the payment of
      such additional amounts.

      pass and implement by-laws which will:
        1. Require disclosure to the agency responsible for the administration

      material  terms  of  any  contract  or  transaction, direct or indirect,
      between an institution and  any  member  of  its  governing  board,  any
      partnership  of  which he or she is a member or any corporation in which
      he or she holds ten per cent or more of the outstanding common stock.
        2. Preclude any member of the governing board of any institution  from
      sharing,  participating  or  benefiting,  directly or indirectly, in the
      proceeds from any contract  or  transaction  entered  into  between  the
      institution and any third party unless such participation or benefit has
      been  approved  in  advance by the agency and the governing board of the
      institution has  approved  the  transaction  by  a  two-thirds  majority
      excluding the vote of member to be benefited.
        3.  Require each member of its governing board to submit to the agency
      each year a disclosure statement  including  such  member's  name,  home
      address,  principal  occupation  and  business interests from which such
      member or such member's spouse or domestic partner received income equal
      to or greater than ten per cent of their aggregate gross  income  during
      the previous year.
        b.  At the discretion of the agency, any payment or any portion of any
      payment may be withheld from any institution which has  failed  to  pass
      and implement such by-laws.
