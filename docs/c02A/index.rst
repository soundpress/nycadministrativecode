      nominations  from that party. The mayor shall appoint three members from
      such list, no more than one of whom  may  be  a  resident  of  the  same

      ninety-three, and every ten years thereafter, shall convene one or  more
      meetings of all of the appointing and recommending authorities specified
      in  subdivision  a  of  this  section  for the purpose of establishing a
      screening and  selection  process  for  ensuring  that  the  racial  and
      language  minority  groups  in  New York city which are protected by the
      United States voting rights  act  of  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,  as
      amended, will be fairly represented on the commission.

      to  make  appointments to the commission shall make such appointments no
      earlier than one year and eight months before, and  no  later  than  one
      year  and  six  months before, the general election of the council to be
      held in the year nineteen hundred  ninety-three,  and  every  ten  years
      thereafter.  In  any  case  in  which  the  chairpersons  of  the county
      committees of a political party are authorized to submit nominations  to
      the  mayor, such nominations shall be submitted no earlier than one year
    
      and eight months before, and no later  than  one  year  and  six  months
      before,  the  general  election  of  the  council to be held in the year

      shall  make appointments to the commission after each council delegation
      authorized to make appointments has done so but not later than one  year
      and  five  months  before  such  a  general election of the council. The
      commission's term shall end sixty  days  after  the  day  of  the  first

      member  enrolled  in  the  same  political  party  from which his or her
      predecessor was selected shall be appointed in the same  manner  as  the
      member  whose  departure  from the commission created a vacancy to serve
      the balance of the term remaining.
        e. No member of the  districting  commission  shall  be  removed  from
      office  except  by  the  person or persons who appointed such member and

      to be audited in the same manner as other city charges.
        g. The commission may hire or contract for necessary staff  assistance
      and  may  require  agencies  of  city  government  to  provide technical
      assistance. The commission shall have a budget as provided by the mayor.

      be guided by the criteria set forth in section fifty-two.
        b. The commission shall hold one or more public hearings not less than

      month before the first such public hearing.
        c.  The  commission shall submit its plan to the city council not less

        d. The plan submitted in accordance with subdivision c of this section
      shall  be  deemed adopted unless, within three weeks, the council by the

      resolutions and a statement of its objections, and with  copies  of  the
      written  objections  of  any  individual members of the council who have
      submitted objections to the speaker prior to such date.  Any  objections
      from  individual  members submitted to the speaker by such date shall be
      transmitted to the districting commission whether  or  not  the  council
      objects to such districting plan.
        e.  Upon  the  receipt  of  any  such  resolution  and objections, the
      commission shall prepare a revised plan and shall,  no  later  than  ten
      months  before such general election of the city council, make such plan
      available to the council and the public for inspection and comment.  The
      commission  shall  hold  public hearings and seek public comment on such
      revised plan.

      final plan for the redistricting of the council.
        g.    Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision d or subdivision f

      clerk, a copy of such plan and a  statement  signed  by  at  least  nine
      members  of  the  commission  certifying  that, within the constraint of
      paragraph a of subdivision one of section fifty-two,  the  criteria  set
      forth  in  the other paragraphs of such subdivision have been applied in
      the order in which they are listed and  that  such  criteria  have  been
      implemented,  in  such  order,  to  the maximum extent practicable. Such
      certification shall also set forth the manner in  which  the  commission
      implemented  the  requirements  of  paragraph  b  of  subdivision one of
      section  fifty-two.    Such  plan  shall  be  deemed  adopted  upon  the
      commission's   filing  with  the  city  clerk  of  such  plan  and  such
      certification.

      act  of  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,  as  amended,  and  making  such
      adjustments in its plan as may be necessary and appropriate  to  respond
      to  a  determination  of  a  court  or  the  United States department of
      justice.

Section 52. ::    
        
     
        §  52.  District plan; criteria. 1. In the preparation of its plan for
      dividing the city into districts for the election  of  council  members,
      the  commission  shall  apply  the  criteria  set forth in the following
      paragraphs to the maximum extent practicable.  The following  paragraphs
      shall  be  applied  and  given  priority  in the order in which they are
      listed.
        a. The difference in population between the  least  populous  and  the
      most  populous  districts  shall  not  exceed ten percentum (10%) of the
      average population for all districts,  according  to  figures  available
      from   the  most  recent  decennial  census.  Any  such  differences  in
      population must be justified by the other criteria  set  forth  in  this
      section.
        b. Such districting plan shall be established in a manner that ensures
      the  fair  and  effective  representation  of  the  racial  and language
      minority groups in New York city  which  are  protected  by  the  United
      States voting rights act of nineteen hundred sixty-five, as amended.
        c. District lines shall keep intact neighborhoods and communities with
      established ties of common interest and association, whether historical,
      racial, economic, ethnic, religious or other.
        d.  Each  district shall be compact and shall be no more than twice as
      long as it is wide.
        e. A district shall not cross borough or county boundaries.
        f. Districts  shall  not  be  drawn  for  the  purpose  of  separating
      geographic concentrations of voters enrolled in the same political party
      into   two  or  more  districts  in  order  to  diminish  the  effective
      representation of such voters.
        g. The  districting  plan  shall  be  established  in  a  manner  that
      minimizes  the  sum  of  the  length  of  the  boundaries  of all of the
      districts included in the plan.
        2. Each district shall  be  contiguous,  and  whenever  a  part  of  a
      district  is separated from the rest of the district by a body of water,
      there shall be a connection by a bridge,  a  tunnel,  a  tramway  or  by
      regular ferry service.
        3.  If  any district includes territory in two boroughs, then no other
      district may also include territory from the same two boroughs.
