      ninety-three, and every ten years thereafter, shall convene one or  more
      meetings of all of the appointing and recommending authorities specified
      in  subdivision  a  of  this  section  for the purpose of establishing a
      screening and  selection  process  for  ensuring  that  the  racial  and
      language  minority  groups  in  New York city which are protected by the
      United States voting rights  act  of  nineteen  hundred  sixty-five,  as
      amended, will be fairly represented on the commission.
        c. Each council delegation authorized by subdivision a of this section
      to  make  appointments to the commission shall make such appointments no
      earlier than one year and eight months before, and  no  later  than  one
      year  and  six  months before, the general election of the council to be
      held in the year nineteen hundred  ninety-three,  and  every  ten  years
      thereafter.  In  any  case  in  which  the  chairpersons  of  the county
      committees of a political party are authorized to submit nominations  to
      the  mayor, such nominations shall be submitted no earlier than one year
    
      and eight months before, and no later  than  one  year  and  six  months
      before,  the  general  election  of  the  council to be held in the year

      shall  make appointments to the commission after each council delegation
      authorized to make appointments has done so but not later than one  year
      and  five  months  before  such  a  general election of the council. The
      commission's term shall end sixty  days  after  the  day  of  the  first

      districting plan, as set forth in section fifty-one.
        d. In the event of a vacancy by death, resignation or otherwise, a new
      member  enrolled  in  the  same  political  party  from which his or her
      predecessor was selected shall be appointed in the same  manner  as  the
      member  whose  departure  from the commission created a vacancy to serve
      the balance of the term remaining.
        e. No member of the  districting  commission  shall  be  removed  from
      office  except  by  the  person or persons who appointed such member and

      except  that  each member shall be allowed actual and necessary expenses
      to be audited in the same manner as other city charges.
        g. The commission may hire or contract for necessary staff  assistance
      and  may  require  agencies  of  city  government  to  provide technical
      assistance. The commission shall have a budget as provided by the mayor.
