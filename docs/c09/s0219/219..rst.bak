Section 219. ::    
        
     
        §  219.  Project  initiation;  commitment  plan. a. The inclusion of a
      capital project in the  capital  budget  as  adopted  or  amended  shall
      constitute  a  direction  and  order  to  the agency to proceed with the
      preparation of a scope  of  project  pursuant  to  this  chapter  unless
      sufficient planning funds for such purpose have not been appropriated in
      the  capital budget. The head of the agency shall notify the comptroller
      of the amount of appropriated planning funds to be encumbered  for  such
      purpose.
        b.  The  approval of a scope of project for a capital project pursuant
      to this chapter,  including  the  amount  of  obligations  necessary  to
      finance  the  design and construction of the project, shall constitute a
      direction and  order  to  the  agency  to  design  the  project,  unless
      sufficient  funds  for  such  purpose  have not been appropriated in the
      capital budget or are otherwise not  available  within  the  appropriate
      program  category of the capital program. Such approval shall constitute
      notification to the comptroller of the  comptroller's  authorization  to
      expend appropriated design funds.
        c.  The approval of the final design for a capital project pursuant to
      this chapter shall constitute  a  direction  and  order  to  the  agency
      responsible  for  construction to prepare bid and award documents and to
      proceed to bid, unless sufficient funds for such purpose have  not  been
      appropriated in the capital budget or are otherwise not available within
      each  year  of  the  capital program in which it is projected that funds
      will be expended for the completion of the project. Such approval  shall
      constitute   notification   to  the  comptroller  of  the  comptroller's
      authorization to expend appropriated construction funds.
        d. The mayor shall require each agency to prepare and submit  periodic
      reports  in  regard  to  the progress of its capital projects, including
      schedules and clear explanations of any delays for  particular  projects
      and  summary  information  on each agency's record on such matters. Such
      reports shall be published at least three times each year: within ninety
      days of the adoption of the capital budget; with the preliminary capital
      budget; and with the executive capital budget. Copies  of  such  reports
      shall  be  transmitted  by  the  mayor to the council, the city planning
      commission, and the community boards, the  borough  boards  and  borough
      presidents.  Such reports shall include, for each project, the dates set
      in the adopted capital budget for the completion of scope,  design,  and
      construction and any changes in such dates.
        1. The report issued with the executive budget shall include, for each
      new   capital   project  being  proposed  in  the  executive  budget,  a
      description of the project including, to  the  extent  practicable,  the
      information  required  to be included in a scope of project by paragraph
      four of section two hundred ten.
        2. The report issued  following  the  adoption  of  the  budget  shall
      include,  for each capital project added to the budget, a description of
      the project  including,  to  the  extent  practicable,  the  information
      required  to  be  included  in  a  scope of project by paragraph four of
      section two hundred ten.
        3. The report issued  following  the  adoption  of  the  budget  shall
      include,  for  each  capital  project for which a substantial change was
      made, a revised description of the  project  including,  to  the  extent
      practicable,  the  information  required  to  be  included in a scope of
      project by paragraph four of section two hundred ten.
        e.  Any  capital  project  which  results  in   the   acquisition   or
      construction   of   a  capital  asset  which  will  be  subject  to  the
      requirements of section eleven hundred ten-a shall contain  a  provision
      requiring  a  comprehensive  manual setting forth the useful life of the
    
      asset and explaining the activities  necessary  to  maintain  the  asset
      throughout such useful life.
        f.  The  mayor may issue directives and adopt rules and regulations in
      regard to  the  execution  of  capital  projects,  consistent  with  the
      requirements  of subdivisions a, b, c and d of this section, which shall
      be binding upon all agencies.
