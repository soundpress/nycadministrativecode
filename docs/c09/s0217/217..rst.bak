Section 217. ::    
        
     
        §  217.    Restrictions on capital projects.  a. No obligations of the
      city shall be issued or authorized for or  on  account  of  any  capital
      project  not  included  in a capital budget, or for which funds have not
      been reserved in an appropriate program category of the capital  program
      for any year of such program in which it is projected that funds will be
      expended  for the completion of the project, or in excess of the maximum
      amount of obligations which may be issued on account of such project  as
      fixed  in  such capital budget; and no amount may be expended on account
      of any capital project in excess of the  amount  appropriated  for  such
      purposes  in  a  capital budget, except that the amount appropriated for
      such purposes may be increased by the mayor by not more than fifteen per
      centum thereof in order to meet  any  costs  required  to  advance  such
      project.    Notice of any such increase shall be provided to the council
      together with a statement of identifiable funds available for payment of
      the increase.
        b.  Funds included in the capital budget for a  capital  project  that
      are  not  obligated  or  committed  during  the  fiscal  year  in  which
      appropriated shall not be  obligated  or  committed  in  the  subsequent
      fiscal  year  unless reappropriated in a subsequent capital budget or an
      amendment thereto.  A capital project included in a capital budget  that
      is  not initiated by the expenditure of funds within two years after its
      inclusion in the budget shall be eliminated from the budget.
        c.  The city may issue capital debt only to finance  capital  projects
      as  defined  in  section two hundred ten.   The   capital budget may not
      include expense items that are properly includable only in  the  expense
      budget,  as  determined in accordance with the accounting principles set
      forth  in  the  state  comptroller's  uniform  system  of  accounts  for
      municipalities, as the same may be modified by the state comptroller, in
      consultation with the city comptroller, for application to the city.
        d.    No  capital  project shall be included in the proposed executive
      capital budget or otherwise adopted as part of the capital budget or  as
      an  amendment  thereto  unless sufficient funds are available within the
      appropriate general program category of the capital program for any year
      of such program in which it is projected that additional  appropriations
      will be necessary for the completion of the project.
