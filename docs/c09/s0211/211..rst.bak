        § 211. Capital budget borough allocations. a. Borough allocation. Five
      percent of the appropriations, funded by debt supported by city tax levy
      funds  and  state  and federal funds over which the city has substantial
      discretion, proposed in the executive capital  budget  for  the  ensuing
      fiscal  year,  except any lump sum appropriation for school construction
      or rapid transit proposed to be made to public  authorities  established
      pursuant  to  the  provisions of state law, shall be allocated among the
      boroughs by a formula based on an equal weighting of factors relating to
      population and geographic area, and shall be known as the capital budget
      borough allocation. Such formula shall be established by local law,  but
      in  any fiscal year for which no such local law is effective such amount
      shall be allocated among the boroughs on the basis of the average of (i)
      each borough's share of the total population of the city, and (ii)  each
      borough's share of the total land area of the city.
        b.   Preliminary   borough   allocations;  initial  borough  president
      notification. Concomitantly  with  the  submission  of  the  preliminary
      capital  budget and preliminary certificate, the mayor shall inform each
      borough president of the portion of the executive capital budget for the
      ensuing fiscal year and of the executive capital budgets for each of the
      three succeeding  years  that,  pursuant  to  the  formula  required  by
      subdivision a of this section, would be allocated to each borough if the
      amount  of  the  appropriations proposed in the executive capital budget
      for each of such fiscal years were the same as the  maximum  amounts  of
      appropriations  for  such  years  which  the  mayor  anticipates  to  be
      certified in the  preliminary  certificate  issued  in  accordance  with
      section  two  hundred  thirty-five.  The amount of such portion shall be
      known as the preliminary capital budget borough allocation.
        c. Borough president proposals. 1. Each borough president, during  the
      consultations  required  by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit
      to the mayor, in such  form  as  the  mayor  shall  prescribe,  proposed
      capital  appropriations  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  that  borough's
      allocation of the capital budget borough allocation as certified by  the
      mayor to the borough presidents during such consultations. The timing of
      such  certification  shall  allow sufficient time for such consultations
      and for  meeting  the  deadlines  established  by  section  two  hundred
      forty-nine. Each such proposed appropriation shall be accompanied by the
      following information:
        (a) for each such proposed appropriation for construction of a capital
      project,  the estimated annual cost to operate and maintain the facility
      to be constructed pursuant to such appropriation  when  construction  is
      completed.  Such  estimates  shall  be  prepared  in accordance with the
      standards established for this purpose pursuant to section  two  hundred
      twenty-one of this chapter and shall be certified by the director of the
      office  of  management and budget. In the event that a borough president
      and the director of management and budget do not agree on such  estimate
      for  a  particular  project,  such  director  and  the  director  of the
      independent budget office shall jointly certify  an  estimate  for  such
      purpose;
        (b)  for  each such proposed appropriation for the planning and design
      of a capital project, (i) the estimated cost of the construction of  the
      project, and (ii) the fiscal year in which the borough president intends
      to  propose  an appropriation for the construction of the project, if no
      technical problems regarding the viability of the project are identified
      during planning,  site  selection  or  design;  (c)  the  total  of  all
      appropriations  which  will be necessary during the three ensuing fiscal
      years to provide for the construction of projects for which planning and
      design appropriations are being proposed.
    
        2.  If  a  borough  president  proposes  an  appropriation   for   the
      construction  of  a  capital project, the appropriation must provide for
      the total amount estimated to be necessary for  the  completion  of  the
      project.  If  such  a  proposed  appropriation for the construction of a
      capital  project is for an amount which is less than the amount that the
      office of management and  budget  estimates  to  be  necessary  for  the
      completion   of  the  project,  the  borough's  capital  budget  borough
      allocation in any future year in  which  additional  appropriations  are
      necessary  for  the  completion  of  the project shall be reduced by the
      amount of such additional appropriations.
        3. If the total appropriations necessary, during any  of  the  ensuing
      three  fiscal years, to provide for the construction of (i) projects for
      which the borough president is proposing appropriations for planning and
      design, and (ii) projects for which appropriations were previously  made
      for  planning and design on the recommendation of the borough president,
      is greater than the capital budget borough allocation anticipated to  be
      available  during such years based on the certificate issued pursuant to
      paragraph sixteen of section two hundred fifty of this charter, then the
      borough president shall submit for inclusion in the executive  budget  a
      list  of  the projects requiring construction appropriations during such
      year, in priority order.
        4. If the estimated annual cost to operate and  maintain  the  capital
      projects  being  proposed  for  construction  by  a borough president is
      greater than the amounts dedicated to such expense budget purposes  from
      the  expense  budget  borough  allocation and the capital budget borough
      allocation expense budget contingency projected to be available  to  the
      borough president in one or more ensuing fiscal years then such proposed
      appropriations  may  only  be  included  by  a  borough president in the
      capital budget with the concurrence of the mayor.
        d. The mayor shall include the proposed  appropriations  submitted  by
      the  borough presidents in accordance with subdivision c of this section
      in the executive capital budget provided however,  that  the  mayor  may
      also   include  such  comments  and  recommendations  relating  to  such
      proposals as the mayor deems appropriate.
