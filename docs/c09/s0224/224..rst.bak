Section 224. ::    
        
     
        §  224.  Works  of  art. a. As used in this section the term "works of
      art" includes all forms of the visual and performing arts  conceived  in
      any medium, material or combination thereof.
        b.  Works  of  art  shall  be  provided for each capital project which
      involves  the  construction  or  the  substantial  reconstruction  of  a
      city-owned  public  building  or  structure  the  intended  use of which
      requires that it be accessible to the public generally or to members  of
      the  public  participating in, requiring or receiving programs, services
      or benefits provided thereat. For the purposes of this section a  police
      precinct house and a firehouse shall be deemed to be such buildings.
        c.  An  amount  not less than one per cent of the first twenty million
      dollars and one-half of one per cent of any amount in excess  of  twenty
      million  dollars of capital funds appropriated by the city for each such
      capital project, other than funds appropriated for  the  acquisition  of
      real  property,  shall be allocated for works of art; provided, however,
      that this section shall in no case require the expenditure of more  than
      four  hundred thousand dollars for works of art for any capital project;
      nor more than the sum of one and one-half million dollars for  works  of
      art  in any fiscal year. The mayor may exempt a capital project from the
      provisions of this section if in his  sole  judgment  the  inclusion  of
      works of art as provided hereby would be inappropriate.
        d.  Reasonable  advance notification of the intention to include works
      of art in a project shall be provided to the appropriate council member,
      borough  president  and  chairperson  of  the  community  board  of  the
      community  district  in  which the project is located. All such works of
      art shall be subject to the approval of the art commission  pursuant  to
      section eight hundred fifty-four of this charter.
        e.  The  mayor  shall  adopt  rules  and  regulations to implement the
      provisions of this section.
