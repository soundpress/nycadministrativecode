        §   216.   Amendment.  a.  Upon receipt of a recommendation in writing
      from the mayor or a borough president, in manner specified  herein,  the
      council  may  amend  the  capital  budget or capital program in the same
      manner as the  adoption  of  the  capital  budget  and  capital  program
      including the right to approve the proposed amendment as submitted or to
      increase  or  decrease  the amounts of funds proposed to be appropriated
      thereby, but only if funds are available within the capital  budget  and
      the  applicable  program  category  of  the  capital  program; provided,
      however, that (i)  the  mayor  may  only  recommend  such  an  amendment
      relating  to an appropriation included in the capital budget pursuant to
      section two hundred eleven with the concurrence of the relevant  borough
      president;  and  (ii)  the  borough  president  may  only  make  such  a
      recommendation with regard to such an appropriation if it  provides  for
      an offsetting reduction in another appropriation included in the capital
      budget  pursuant  to section two hundred eleven on the recommendation of
      such borough president and it is concurred in by the mayor.
        b.  Upon the adoption of any such amendment by the  council, it  shall
      be  certified  by the mayor, the public advocate and the city clerk, and
      the capital budget shall be amended accordingly.
        c.  Not later than five days after such certification  such  amendment
      shall  be  filed in the office of the comptroller and shall be published
      forthwith in the City Record.
