        § 211. Capital budget borough allocations. a. Borough allocation. Five
      percent of the appropriations, funded by debt supported by city tax levy
      funds  and  state  and federal funds over which the city has substantial
      discretion, proposed in the executive capital  budget  for  the  ensuing
      fiscal  year,  except any lump sum appropriation for school construction
      or rapid transit proposed to be made to public  authorities  established
      pursuant  to  the  provisions of state law, shall be allocated among the
      boroughs by a formula based on an equal weighting of factors relating to
      population and geographic area, and shall be known as the capital budget
      borough allocation. Such formula shall be established by local law,  but
      in  any fiscal year for which no such local law is effective such amount
      shall be allocated among the boroughs on the basis of the average of (i)
      each borough's share of the total population of the city, and (ii)  each
      borough's share of the total land area of the city.
        b.   Preliminary   borough   allocations;  initial  borough  president
      notification. Concomitantly  with  the  submission  of  the  preliminary
      capital  budget and preliminary certificate, the mayor shall inform each
      borough president of the portion of the executive capital budget for the
      ensuing fiscal year and of the executive capital budgets for each of the
      three succeeding  years  that,  pursuant  to  the  formula  required  by
      subdivision a of this section, would be allocated to each borough if the
      amount  of  the  appropriations proposed in the executive capital budget
      for each of such fiscal years were the same as the  maximum  amounts  of
      appropriations  for  such  years  which  the  mayor  anticipates  to  be
      certified in the  preliminary  certificate  issued  in  accordance  with
      section  two  hundred  thirty-five.  The amount of such portion shall be
      known as the preliminary capital budget borough allocation.
        c. Borough president proposals. 1. Each borough president, during  the
      consultations  required  by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit
      to the mayor, in such  form  as  the  mayor  shall  prescribe,  proposed
      capital  appropriations  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  that  borough's
      allocation of the capital budget borough allocation as certified by  the
      mayor to the borough presidents during such consultations. The timing of
      such  certification  shall  allow sufficient time for such consultations
      and for  meeting  the  deadlines  established  by  section  two  hundred
      forty-nine. Each such proposed appropriation shall be accompanied by the
      following information:
        (a) for each such proposed appropriation for construction of a capital
      project,  the estimated annual cost to operate and maintain the facility
      to be constructed pursuant to such appropriation  when  construction  is
      completed.  Such  estimates  shall  be  prepared  in accordance with the
      standards established for this purpose pursuant to section  two  hundred
      twenty-one of this chapter and shall be certified by the director of the
      office  of  management and budget. In the event that a borough president
      and the director of management and budget do not agree on such  estimate
      for  a  particular  project,  such  director  and  the  director  of the
      independent budget office shall jointly certify  an  estimate  for  such
      purpose;
        (b)  for  each such proposed appropriation for the planning and design
      of a capital project, (i) the estimated cost of the construction of  the
      project, and (ii) the fiscal year in which the borough president intends
      to  propose  an appropriation for the construction of the project, if no
      technical problems regarding the viability of the project are identified
      during planning,  site  selection  or  design;  (c)  the  total  of  all
      appropriations  which  will be necessary during the three ensuing fiscal
      years to provide for the construction of projects for which planning and
      design appropriations are being proposed.
    
        2.  If  a  borough  president  proposes  an  appropriation   for   the
      construction  of  a  capital project, the appropriation must provide for
      the total amount estimated to be necessary for  the  completion  of  the
      project.  If  such  a  proposed  appropriation for the construction of a
      capital  project is for an amount which is less than the amount that the
      office of management and  budget  estimates  to  be  necessary  for  the
      completion   of  the  project,  the  borough's  capital  budget  borough
      allocation in any future year in  which  additional  appropriations  are
      necessary  for  the  completion  of  the project shall be reduced by the
      amount of such additional appropriations.
        3. If the total appropriations necessary, during any  of  the  ensuing
      three  fiscal years, to provide for the construction of (i) projects for
      which the borough president is proposing appropriations for planning and
      design, and (ii) projects for which appropriations were previously  made
      for  planning and design on the recommendation of the borough president,
      is greater than the capital budget borough allocation anticipated to  be
      available  during such years based on the certificate issued pursuant to
      paragraph sixteen of section two hundred fifty of this charter, then the
      borough president shall submit for inclusion in the executive  budget  a
      list  of  the projects requiring construction appropriations during such
      year, in priority order.
        4. If the estimated annual cost to operate and  maintain  the  capital
      projects  being  proposed  for  construction  by  a borough president is
      greater than the amounts dedicated to such expense budget purposes  from
      the  expense  budget  borough  allocation and the capital budget borough
      allocation expense budget contingency projected to be available  to  the
      borough president in one or more ensuing fiscal years then such proposed
      appropriations  may  only  be  included  by  a  borough president in the
      capital budget with the concurrence of the mayor.
        d. The mayor shall include the proposed  appropriations  submitted  by
      the  borough presidents in accordance with subdivision c of this section
      in the executive capital budget provided however,  that  the  mayor  may
      also   include  such  comments  and  recommendations  relating  to  such
      proposals as the mayor deems appropriate.

      project  not  included  in a capital budget, or for which funds have not
      been reserved in an appropriate program category of the capital  program
      for any year of such program in which it is projected that funds will be

      is  not initiated by the expenditure of funds within two years after its
      inclusion in the budget shall be eliminated from the budget.

        d.    No  capital  project shall be included in the proposed executive
      capital budget or otherwise adopted as part of the capital budget or  as

        §  219.  Project  initiation;  commitment  plan. a. The inclusion of a
      capital project in the  capital  budget  as  adopted  or  amended  shall
      constitute  a  direction  and  order  to  the agency to proceed with the

      proceed to bid, unless sufficient funds for such purpose have  not  been
      appropriated in the capital budget or are otherwise not available within
      each  year  of  the  capital program in which it is projected that funds
      will be expended for the completion of the project. Such approval  shall
      constitute   notification   to  the  comptroller  of  the  comptroller's
      authorization to expend appropriated construction funds.
        d. The mayor shall require each agency to prepare and submit  periodic
      reports  in  regard  to  the progress of its capital projects, including
      schedules and clear explanations of any delays for  particular  projects
      and  summary  information  on each agency's record on such matters. Such
      reports shall be published at least three times each year: within ninety
      days of the adoption of the capital budget; with the preliminary capital
      budget; and with the executive capital budget. Copies  of  such  reports
      shall  be  transmitted  by  the  mayor to the council, the city planning
      commission, and the community boards, the  borough  boards  and  borough
      presidents.  Such reports shall include, for each project, the dates set
      in the adopted capital budget for the completion of scope,  design,  and
      construction and any changes in such dates.
        1. The report issued with the executive budget shall include, for each
      new   capital   project  being  proposed  in  the  executive  budget,  a

      addition to such twenty-five percent (25%) reduction in energy cost, the
      design  agency  shall  make investments in energy efficiency that reduce
      energy cost by an additional five percent (5%)  if  it  finds  that  the
      payback  on  such  investment  through  savings in energy cost would not
      exceed seven years.
        (iii) Capital projects involving  buildings  classified  in  occupancy
      group  G  with  an  estimated  construction  cost  of 12 million dollars
      ($12,000,000) or more shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy
      cost by a  minimum  of  twenty  percent  (20%),  as  determined  by  the
      methodology prescribed in LEED energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New
      York  state  energy  conservation  code, whichever is more stringent. In
      addition to such twenty percent (20%)  reduction  in  energy  cost,  the
      design  agency  shall  make investments in energy efficiency that reduce
      energy cost by an additional five percent (5%)  if  it  finds  that  the
      payback  on  such  investment  through  savings in energy cost would not
      exceed seven years or, in the alternative, the design agency shall  make
      investments   in  energy  efficiency  that  reduce  energy  cost  by  an
      additional ten percent (10%) if  it  finds  that  the  payback  on  such
      investment through savings in energy cost would not exceed seven years.

      involves  the  installation  or  replacement  of  lighting  systems in a
    
      building at an estimated construction  cost  for  such  installation  or
      replacement  of  one  million  dollars  ($1,000,000)  or  more, shall be
      designed and constructed to reduce energy  cost  by  a  minimum  of  ten
      percent  (10%),  as  determined  by  the  methodology prescribed in LEED
      energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New York state energy conservation
      code, whichever is more stringent.
        (2) Each capital project, other than a project required to comply with
      paragraph one of this subdivision, that  involves  the  installation  or
      replacement  of  HVAC comfort controls at an estimated construction cost
      for such installation or replacement of two million dollars ($2,000,000)
      or more, shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy  cost  by  a
      minimum of five percent (5%) as determined by the methodology prescribed
      in  LEED  energy  and  atmosphere  credit 1 or the New York state energy

      percent  (30%),  as  determined by a methodology not less stringent than
      that prescribed in LEED water efficiency credit 3.2; provided,  however,
      that  such  percentage  shall  be  reduced  to  a  minimum of 20% if the
      department of buildings rejects an application for the use of  waterless
      urinals for the project.
        e.  This  section  shall  apply  only  to  capital  projects involving
      buildings classified in occupancy groups B-1, B-2,  C,  E,  F-1a,  F-1b,
      F-3, F-4, G, H-1 and H-2.
        f.  The  mayor  may exempt from each provision of this section capitol
      projects accounting for up to 20% of the capital dollars in each  fiscal
      year  subject  to  such  provision  if  in his or her sole judgment such
      exemption is necessary in the public interest. At the conclusion of each
      fiscal year the mayor shall report to the council the exemptions granted
      pursuant to this section.
