*§ 10-133 Possession of knives or instruments.* ::


a. Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found that the possession in public places, streets and parks of the city, of large knives is a menace to the public health, peace, safety and welfare of the people of the city; that the possession in public places, streets and parks of such knives has resulted in the commission of many homicides, robberies, maimings and assaults of and upon the people of the city; that this condition encourages and fosters the commission of crimes, and contributes to juvenile delinquency, youth crime and gangsterism; that unless the possession or carrying in public places, streets and parks of the city of such knives without a lawful purpose is prohibited, there is danger of an increase in crimes of violence and other conditions detrimental to public peace, safety and welfare. It is further declared and found that the wearing or carrying of knives in open view in public places while such knives are not being used for a lawful purpose is unnecessary and threatening to the public and should be prohibited.

b. It shall be unlawful for any person to carry on his or her person or have in such person's possession, in any public place, street, or park any knife which has a blade length of four inches or more.

c. It shall be unlawful for any person in a public place, street or park, to wear outside of his or her clothing or carry in open view any knife with an exposed or unexposed blade unless such person is actually using such knife for a lawful purpose as set forth in subdivision d of this section.

d. The provisions of subdivisions b and c of this section shall not apply to (1) persons in the military service of the state of New York when duly authorized to carry or display knives pursuant to regulations issued by the chief of staff to the governor; (2) police officers and peace officers as defined in the criminal procedure law; (3) participants in special events when authorized by the police commissioner; (4) persons in the military or other service of the United States, in pursuit of official duty authorized by federal law; (5) emergency medical technicians or voluntary or paid ambulance drivers while engaged in the performance of their duties; or (6) any person displaying or in possession of a knife otherwise in violation of this section when such knife (a) is being used for or transported immediately to or from a place where it is used for hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, picnicking or any employment, trade or occupation customarily requiring the use of such knife; or (b) is displayed or carried by a member of a theatrical group, drill team, military or para-military unit or veterans organization, to, from, or during a meeting, parade or other performance or practice for such event, which customarily requires the carrying of such knife; or (c) is being transported directly to or from a place of purchase, sharpening or repair, packaged in such a manner as not to allow easy access to such knife while it is transported; or (d) is displayed or carried by a duly enrolled member of the Boy or Girl Scouts of America or a similar organization or society and such display or possession is necessary to participate in the activities of such organization or society.

e. Violation of this section shall be an offense punishable by a fine of not more than three hundred dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days or by both such fine and imprisonment.






*§ 10-134 Prohibition on sale of certain knives.* ::


a. Legislative findings. It is hereby declared and found that the possession in public places, streets and parks of the city, of folding knives which lock upon opening, is a menace to the public health, peace, safety and welfare of the people of the city; that the possession in public places, streets and parks of such knives has resulted in the commission of many homicides, robberies, maimings and assaults of and upon the people of the city, that this condition encourages and fosters the commission of crimes, and contributes to juvenile delinquency, youth crime and gangsterism; that if this situation is not addressed, then there is a danger of an increase in crimes of violence, and other conditions detrimental to public peace, safety and welfare. It has been found that folding knives with a blade of four (4) inches or more that locks in an open position are designed and used almost exclusively for the purpose of stabbing or the threat thereof. Therefore for the safety of the city, such weapons should be prohibited from sale within the jurisdiction of the city of New York.

b. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, or offer for sale within the jurisdiction of the city of New York, any folding knife with a blade length of four or more inches which is so constructed that when it is opened it is locked in an open position and cannot be closed without depressing or moving a release mechanism.

c. Exempt from this section are importers and exporters or merchants who ship or receive locking folding knives, with a blade length of four or more inches, in bulk, which knives are scheduled to travel or have travelled in the course of international, interstate, or intrastate commerce to a point outside the city. Such bulk shipments shall remain in their original shipping package, unopened, except for inspection and possible subdivision for further movement in interstate or intrastate commerce to a point outside the city.

d. Violation of this section shall be an offense punishable by a fine of not more than seven hundred fifty dollars ($750) or by imprisonment not exceeding fifteen days (15) or both such fine and imprisonment. Any person violating this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars for each violation.






*§ 10-134.1 Prohibition on sale of box cutters to persons under twenty-one years of age, open displays of box cutters by sellers, and possession of box cutters in a public place, or on school premises by persons under twenty-two years of age.* ::


a. Legislative findings. The council hereby finds that the number of school safety incidents which take place in the city's schools are disturbingly high and are rising, and that these incidents place students and staff at unacceptable risk of injury and disrupt the learning environment. Board of education statistics reveal that for the first half of the 1994-95 school year, 8,333 school safety incidents occurred, representing a 27.6 percent increase as compared with the same period in the prior year. Board of education statistics also reveal that for the entire 1994-95 school year, 19,814 school safety incidents were reported, representing an increase of 16 percent as compared to the prior school year. The council further finds that the board of education's school safety statistics reveal that over 2,000 box cutters and other similar implements were seized during the 1994-95 school year, indicating that these instruments have become the "weapon of choice" in the city's schools. These implements are used as weapons by students as they are relatively inexpensive, readily available, and easily deployable. Used as weapons, box cutters and similar instruments can cause great injury. It is the council's belief that banning the sale of box cutters to minors under eighteen year of age, requiring that those who sell box cutters ensure that they are not displayed in a manner that increases opportunities for minors to steal them, and banning the possession of box cutters by persons under twenty-two years of age on school premises, will significantly help in reducing the number of violent school safety incidents and in ensuring that schools are the safe havens of knowledge and education that children need and deserve.

b. Definitions. For purposes of this section:

   (1) "Box cutter" means any knife consisting of a razor blade, retractable, nonretractable, or detachable in segments, attached to or contained within a plastic or metal housing, including utility knives, snap-off knives, and box cart cutters.

   (4) "School premises" means the buildings, grounds, or facilities, or any portion thereof, owned, occupied by, or under the custody or control of public and private institutions for the primary purpose of providing educational instruction to students, and any vehicles owned, operated or leased by such institutions which are used to transport such students or the personnel of such institutions.

c. It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer to sell or cause any person to sell or offer to sell a box cutter to any individual under twenty-one years of age.

d.

*§ 10-138 Distribution of a Model Code of Conduct to participants in youth sports programs.* ::

Through sports programs, our youth learn the importance of teamwork, cooperation, effort, discipline and commitment. Furthermore, regular physical activity is the cornerstone of an active and healthy lifestyle. Unfortunately, good sportsmanship is sometimes lacking on the part of coaches, parents, players, spectators and other persons involved in youth sports programs, resulting in the creation of a hostile environment for participants. The City Council finds that in order to realize the full potential and value of youth sports programs, participants in such programs should follow a Code of Conduct that reflects principles of good sportsmanship at all youth sports events. Furthermore, the City Council finds that organizations that administer youth sports programs should have the option of banning coaches, parents, players, spectators and other participants in youth sports programs from attending youth sports events if they engage in certain egregious behavior at such events.

*§ 10-150 Declaration and findings; election for non-public office.* ::


The council hereby finds that it is in the public interest to hold certain elections on days other than those which the vast majority of the people of the city respect as a day of worship and a day of rest. The holding of elections on such days of worship is unfair to those citizens who observe such days of worship in that they are unable to participate fully in the election process on an equal basis unless they violate their religious precepts. This poses a threat to the free exercise of religion and equality of access to the electoral process. The council further finds and declares that bigotry, prejudice and intolerance will be discouraged if such elections are forbidden on those days of worship, and that holding elections on other days will permit the participation of a greater number of people.






*§ 10-151 Elections for non-public office or position.* ::

b. It shall be unlawful for any person to direct, mandate, supervise or assist in conducting any such elections.






*§ 10-152 Penalty.* ::


a. Any person who shall violate any provision of section 10-151, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not more than ten days, or both such fine and imprisonment.

b. The results of any election held in violation of section 10-151 shall be null and void.






*§ 10-153 First aid kits on vehicles for hire.* ::


a. All motor vehicles for hire, used to transport any persons, with a seating capacity of ten or more persons, including the driver, whether by charter or for a term of months shall provide equipment and maintain on board the vehicle at all times, a complete first aid kit containing all that equipment reasonably calculated to provide emergency medical aid to injured persons.

Any person who shall knowingly make a false statement or who shall knowingly falsify or allow to be falsified any certificate, form, signed statement, application or report required under the provisions of this code or any rule or regulation of any agency promulgated thereunder, shall be guilty of an offense and upon conviction thereof shall be punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment of a term of not more than sixty days or both.

Of the remaining two fingerprint cards, one shall be filed with the executive department, division of state police, Albany, within ten days after issuance of the license, and the other remain on file with the police department. No such fingerprints may be inspected by any person other than a peace officer, when acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or a police officer except on order of a judge or justice of a court of record either upon notice to the licensee or without notice, as the judge or justice may deem appropriate.

Any application to renew a license that has not previously expired, been revoked or cancelled shall thereby extend the term of the license until disposition is made of the application by the police commissioner.

l. The police commissioner, upon evidence of any disqualification set forth in subdivision b of this section, may at any time suspend or revoke and cancel a license issued pursuant to this section.

The affidavit shall also describe the date and contents of any report required to be made pursuant to section 400.10 of the penal law.

   (5) In addition to the penalties specified in section 10-310, any act or omission that constitutes a violation of this subdivision or of rules and regulations issued by the commissioner pursuant thereto shall be grounds for the revocation of a license issued by the commissioner pursuant to this section.

No such fingerprints may be inspected by any person other than a peace officer, when acting pursuant to his or her special duties, or a police officer, except on order of a justice of a court of record either upon notice to the permittee or without notice, as the judge or justice may deem appropriate. Upon completion of the investigation, the police department shall report the results to the police commissioner without unnecessary delay.

d. Fees. The fee for an application for a rifle and shotgun permit or renewal thereof shall be one hundred forty dollars.

e. Issuance.

   (1) Upon completion of the investigation, and in no event later than thirty days from the submission of the application, unless the police commissioner determines more time is needed for an investigation and then it shall not exceed sixty days, the commissioner shall issue the permit or shall notify the applicant of the denial of the application and the reason or reasons therefor. The applicant shall have the right to appeal said denial pursuant to procedures established by the police commissioner for administrative review.

   (2) Any person holding a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in accordance with the provisions of the penal law, shall be issued such permit upon filing an application and upon paying the established fee therefor, without the necessity of any further investigation, affidavits or fingerprinting, unless the police commissioner has reason to believe that the status of the applicant has changed since the issuance of the prior license.

f. Validity. Any person to whom a rifle and shotgun permit has been validly issued pursuant to this chapter may possess a rifle or shotgun. No permit shall be transferred to any other person. Every person carrying a rifle or shotgun shall have on his or her person a permit which shall be exhibited for inspection to any peace officer or police officer upon demand. Failure of any such person to so exhibit his or her permit shall be presumptive evidence that he or she is not duly authorized to possess a rifle or shotgun and the same may be considered by the police commissioner as cause for revocation or suspension of such permit. A permit shall be valid for three (3) years and shall be subject to automatic renewal, upon sworn application, and without investigation, unless the police commissioner has reason to believe that the status of the applicant has changed since the previous application.

g. Revocation or suspension. A permit shall be revoked upon the conviction in this state, or elsewhere, of a person holding a rifle or shotgun permit, of a felony or a serious offense. A permit may be revoked or suspended at any time upon evidence of any other disqualification set forth in subdivision a of this section. Upon revocation or suspension of a permit for any reason, the police commissioner shall immediately notify the New York state division of criminal justice services. The police commissioner shall from time to time send a notice and supplemental report hereof, containing the names, addresses and permit numbers of each person whose rifle and shotgun permit has been revoked or suspended to all licensed dealers in rifles and shotguns throughout the city for the purpose of notifying such dealers that no rifles or shotguns may be issued or sold or in any way disposed of to any such persons. The police commissioner or any police officer acting at the police commissioner's direction shall forthwith seize any rifle and shotgun permit which has been revoked or suspended hereunder and shall seize any rifle or shotgun possessed by such person, provided that the person whose rifle or shotgun permit has been revoked or suspended, or such person's appointee or legal representative, shall have the right at any time up to one year after such seizure to dispose of such rifle or shotgun to any licensed dealer or any other person legally permitted to purchase or take possession of such rifle or shotgun. The permittee shall have the right to appeal any suspension or revocation pursuant to procedures established by the commissioner for administrative review.

h. Non-residents. Non-residents of the city of New York may apply for a rifle or shotgun permit subject to the same conditions, regulations and requirements as residents of the city of New York.

Upon receipt of acknowledgement of said declaration by the police commissioner, the declarant may lawfully sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of such rifles or shotguns to a licensed dealer or any other person legally permitted to purchase or take possession of such rifles or shotguns. Any willful or material omission or false statement shall be a violation of this section.

Upon demand, the appropriate certificate shall be exhibited for inspection to any peace officer or police officer.

Chapter 11: Actions By Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 10-1101 Short title.* ::


This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Law".








*§ 10-1102 Declaration of legislative findings and intent.* ::


Gender-motivated violence inflicts serious physical, psychological, emotional and economic harm on its victims. Congressional findings have documented that gender-motivated violence is widespread throughout the United States, representing the leading cause of injuries to women ages 15 to 44. Further statistics have shown that three out of four women will be the victim of a violent crime sometime during their lives, and as many as 4,000,000 women a year are victims of domestic violence. Senate hearings, various task forces and the United States department of justice have concluded that victims of gender-motivated violence frequently face a climate of condescension, indifference and hostility in the court system and have documented the legal system's hostility towards sexual assault and domestic violence claims. Recognizing this widespread problem, congress in 1994 provided victims of gender-motivated violence with a cause of action in federal court through the violence against women act (VAWA) (section 13981 of title 42 of the United States code). In a May 15, 2000, decision, the United States supreme court held that the constitution provided no basis for a federal cause of action by victims of gender-motivated violence against perpetrators of offenses committed against them either under the commerce clause or the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. In so ruling, the court held that it could "think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims."








*§ 10-1103 Definitions.* ::


As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:

Crime of violence. The term "crime of violence" means an act or series of acts that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against the person as defined in state or federal law or that would constitute a misdemeanor or felony against property as defined in state or federal law if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction.

Crime of violence motivated by gender. The term "crime of violence motivated by gender" means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender.








*§ 10-1104 Civil cause of action.* ::


Except as otherwise provided by law, any person claiming to be injured by an individual who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender has a cause of action against such individual in any court of competent jurisdiction for any or all of the following relief:

a. Compensatory and punitive damages;

b. Injunctive and declaratory relief;

c. Attorney's fees and costs; and

d. Such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.








*§ 10-1105 Limitations.* ::


a. A civil action under this chapter shall be commenced within seven years after the alleged crime of violence motivated by gender occurred. If, however, due to injury or disability resulting from an act or acts giving rise to a cause of action under this chapter, or due to infancy as defined in the civil procedure law and rules, a person entitled to commence an action under this chapter is unable to do so at the time such cause of action accrues, then the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to seven years after the inability to commence the action ceases.

b. Except as otherwise permitted by law, nothing in this chapter entitles a person to a cause of action for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by preponderance of the evidence, to be a crime of violence motivated by gender.

c. Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under this chapter.








*§ 10-1106 Burden of proof.* ::


Conviction of a crime arising out of the same transaction, occurrence or event giving rise to a cause of action under this chapter is conclusive proof of the underlying facts of that crime for purposes of an action brought under this chapter. That such crime was a crime of violence motivated by gender must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.








*§ 10-1107 Severability.* ::


If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other portion of this chapter is, for any reason, declared unconstitutional or invalid, in whole or in part, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed severable, and such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this law, which remaining portions shall continue in full force and effect.
