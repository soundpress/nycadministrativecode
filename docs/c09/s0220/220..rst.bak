        §  220.  Improvements  payable  other  than by city. Any owner of real
      property or any other person interested may  apply  to  the  council  to
      authorize  an  improvement referred to in paragraph d of subdivision one
      of section two hundred ten hereof, not included in the  capital  budget.
      The  council may authorize such improvement to be made by the city or by
      such owner or other person interested upon compliance with the following
      conditions:
        1. Such owner or group or other persons interested shall enter into an
      agreement with the city, whereby they will either authorize the city, or
      themselves agree, to perform such work in accordance with such plans and
      specifications approved by the agencies  having  jurisdiction  thereover
      and under their supervision.
        2.  All  of  such work shall be done for the account of or at the sole
      cost and expense of the person or persons applying for permission to  do
      the same, who shall furnish to the city such security and in such amount
      as may be required to secure the payment of such cost and expense or the
      proper performance of the said work in the time and in the manner agreed
      upon,  and  shall  further  secure the city, in the latter case, against
      latent defects in such work for a period of two years.
        3. Such improvement shall be approved by the city planning  commission
      and  reviewed  pursuant  to  sections one hundred ninety-seven-c and one
      hundred ninety-seven-d.
        4. Any agreement providing for the performance of such  work  and  the
      furnishing  of  such  security,  shall  be first approved by the council
      before the same shall become effective.
