      elects to utilize green building standards other  than  the  LEED  green
      building  rating  system, the mayor shall publish findings demonstrating
      that such other green building standards are not less stringent than the
      LEED standards described above for achievement of a LEED silver  or,  if
      applicable,  a  LEED  certified  rating.  The  green  building standards
      utilized by the city in accordance with this section shall  be  reviewed
      and  updated,  as  necessary, by the mayor no less often that once every
      three years.
        (2) In addition, if the  estimated  construction  cost  of  a  project
      required  to  comply  with  green  building standards in accordance with
      paragraph one of this subdivision is 12 million dollars ($12,000,000) or
      more such project shall be designed and  constructed  to  reduce  energy
      cost as follows:
        (i)  Capital  projects,  other  than buildings classified in occupancy
      group G, with an estimated  construction  cost  of  12  million  dollars
      ($12,000,000)  or  more  but  less than 30 million dollars ($30,000,000)
      shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy cost by a minimum  of
      twenty  percent  (20%),  as  determined by the methodology prescribed in
      LEED energy and atmosphere  credit  1  or  the  New  York  state  energy
      conservation  code,  whichever  is  more  stringent. In addition to such
      twenty percent (20%) reduction in energy cost, the design  agency  shall
      make  investments  in  energy  efficiency  that reduce energy cost by an
      additional five percent (5%) if  it  finds  that  the  payback  on  such
      investment through savings in energy cost would not exceed seven years.
        (ii)  Capital  projects,  other than buildings classified in occupancy
      group G, with an estimated  construction  cost  of  30  million  dollars
      ($30,000,000) or more shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy
      cost  by  a  minimum  of twenty-five percent (25%), as determined by the
      methodology prescribed in LEED energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New
      York state energy conservation code, whichever  is  more  stringent.  In
      addition to such twenty-five percent (25%) reduction in energy cost, the
      design  agency  shall  make investments in energy efficiency that reduce
      energy cost by an additional five percent (5%)  if  it  finds  that  the
      payback  on  such  investment  through  savings in energy cost would not
      exceed seven years.
        (iii) Capital projects involving  buildings  classified  in  occupancy
      group  G  with  an  estimated  construction  cost  of 12 million dollars
      ($12,000,000) or more shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy
      cost by a  minimum  of  twenty  percent  (20%),  as  determined  by  the
      methodology prescribed in LEED energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New
      York  state  energy  conservation  code, whichever is more stringent. In
      addition to such twenty percent (20%)  reduction  in  energy  cost,  the
      design  agency  shall  make investments in energy efficiency that reduce
      energy cost by an additional five percent (5%)  if  it  finds  that  the
      payback  on  such  investment  through  savings in energy cost would not
      exceed seven years or, in the alternative, the design agency shall  make
      investments   in  energy  efficiency  that  reduce  energy  cost  by  an
      additional ten percent (10%) if  it  finds  that  the  payback  on  such
      investment through savings in energy cost would not exceed seven years.
        c.  Capital  projects,  other than those required to comply with green
      building standards in accordance with subdivision  b  of  this  section,
      shall be subject to the following:
        (1) Each capital project that includes the installation or replacement
      of  a  boiler at an estimated construction cost for such installation or
      replacement of  two  million  dollars  ($2,000,000)  or  more,  or  that
      involves  the  installation  or  replacement  of  lighting  systems in a
    
      building at an estimated construction  cost  for  such  installation  or
      replacement  of  one  million  dollars  ($1,000,000)  or  more, shall be
      designed and constructed to reduce energy  cost  by  a  minimum  of  ten
      percent  (10%),  as  determined  by  the  methodology prescribed in LEED
      energy and atmosphere credit 1 or the New York state energy conservation
      code, whichever is more stringent.
        (2) Each capital project, other than a project required to comply with
      paragraph one of this subdivision, that  involves  the  installation  or
      replacement  of  HVAC comfort controls at an estimated construction cost
      for such installation or replacement of two million dollars ($2,000,000)
      or more, shall be designed and constructed to reduce energy  cost  by  a
      minimum of five percent (5%) as determined by the methodology prescribed
      in  LEED  energy  and  atmosphere  credit 1 or the New York state energy
      conservation code, whichever is more stringent.

      this  section,  each  capital  project  involving  the  installation  or
      replacement of  plumbing  systems  that  includes  the  installation  or
      replacement  of  plumbing fixtures at an estimated construction cost for
      such installation or replacement of plumbing  systems  of  five  hundred
      thousand dollars ($500,000) or more shall be designed and constructed to
      reduce potable water consumption in the aggregate by a minimum of thirty
      percent  (30%),  as  determined by a methodology not less stringent than
      that prescribed in LEED water efficiency credit 3.2; provided,  however,
      that  such  percentage  shall  be  reduced  to  a  minimum of 20% if the
      department of buildings rejects an application for the use of  waterless
      urinals for the project.
        e.  This  section  shall  apply  only  to  capital  projects involving
      buildings classified in occupancy groups B-1, B-2,  C,  E,  F-1a,  F-1b,
      F-3, F-4, G, H-1 and H-2.
        f.  The  mayor  may exempt from each provision of this section capitol
      projects accounting for up to 20% of the capital dollars in each  fiscal
      year  subject  to  such  provision  if  in his or her sole judgment such
      exemption is necessary in the public interest. At the conclusion of each
      fiscal year the mayor shall report to the council the exemptions granted
      pursuant to this section.
        g. This section shall not apply to capital projects of  entities  that
      are  not  city  agencies  unless  fifty  percent  (50%)  or  more of the
      estimated cost of such project is  to  be  paid  for  out  of  the  city
      treasury.  This  exemption  shall  not apply to any capital project that
      receives ten million dollars ($10,000,000)  or  more  out  of  the  city
      treasury.

      capital dollars from the city treasury before January 1, 2007.
        i.  The  mayor  shall  promulgate rules to carry out the provisions of
      this section.
        j. The costs listed in subdivisions b, c, d  and  g  of  this  section
      shall be indexed to inflation.
        * k.  Capital  projects accounting for at least fifty percent (50%) of
      the capital dollars in each fiscal year allocated for each  city  agency
      that  are subject to paragraph one of subdivision b of this section that
      utilize a version of the LEED green building rating system for which the
      United States  Green  Building  Council  will  accept  applications  for
