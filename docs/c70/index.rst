Section 2800. ::    
        
     
        §  2800.  Community  boards.  a.  For  each community district created
      pursuant to chapter sixty-nine there shall be a  community  board  which
      shall  consist  of  (1)  not  more  than  fifty persons appointed by the
      borough president for staggered terms of two years, at least one-half of
      whom shall be appointed from nominees of  the  council  members  elected
      from council districts which include any part of the community district,
      and  (2)  all  such council members as non-voting members. The number of
      members appointed on the nomination of each such council member shall be
      proportional to the share of the district population represented by such
      council  member.  The  city  planning  commission,  after  each  council
      redistricting  pursuant  to  chapter  two-A,  and  after  each community
      redistricting  pursuant  to  section  twenty-seven  hundred  two,  shall
      determine   the   proportion  of  the  community  district's  population
      represented by each council member. Copies of such determinations  shall
      be  filed  with  the appropriate borough president, community board, and
      council member. One-half of the members appointed to any community board
      shall serve for a term of two years beginning on the first day of  April
      in  each odd-numbered year in which they take office and one half of the
      members appointed to any community board shall serve for a term  of  two
      years  beginning on the first day of April in each even-numbered year in
      which they take office. Members shall serve until their  successors  are
      appointed  but  no  member  may serve for more than sixty days after the
      expiration of his or her original term unless reappointed by the borough
      president. Not more than twenty-five percent of  the  appointed  members
      shall  be city employees. No person shall be appointed to or remain as a
      member  of  the  board  who  does  not  have  a   residence,   business,
      professional  or other significant interest in the district. The borough
      president  shall  assure  adequate  representation  from  the  different
      geographic  sections and neighborhoods within the community district. In
      making such appointments, the borough president shall  consider  whether
      the  aggregate  of  appointments  fairly  represents all segments of the
      community. Community boards, civic groups and other community groups and
      neighborhood  associations  may  submit  nominations  to   the   borough
      president and to council members.
        b.  An  appointed  member  may  be  removed from a community board for
      cause,  which  shall  include  substantial  nonattendance  at  board  or
      committee meetings over a period of six months, by the borough president
      or  by  a  majority  vote  of  the  community board. Vacancies among the
      appointed members shall be filled promptly upon the  occurrence  of  the
      vacancy by the borough president for the remainder of the unexpired term
      in the same manner as regular appointments.
        c.   Members   of   community  boards  shall  serve  as  such  without
      compensation  but  shall  be  reimbursed  for   actual   and   necessary
      out-of-pocket  expenses  in  connection  with  attendance  at  regularly
      scheduled meetings of the community board.
        d. Each community board shall:
        (1) Consider the needs of the district which it serves;
        (2) Cooperate with, consult, assist and  advise  any  public  officer,
      agency,  local  administrators  of  agencies,  legislative  body, or the
      borough president with respect to any matter relating to the welfare  of
      the district and its residents;
        (3)   At   its   discretion   hold   public  or  private  hearings  or
      investigations with respect to any matter relating to the welfare of the
      district and its residents, but the board shall take action  only  at  a
      meeting open to the public;
        (4)  Assist  city  departments  and agencies in communicating with and
      transmitting information to the people of the district;

      its activities and transactions,  including  minutes  of  its  meetings,

      addresses available to the public upon request.
        e.  Each  agency  shall  furnish  promptly  to each community board on

      reviewing  the  scope or design of a capital project located within such
      community board's district when such scope or design is presented to the
      community board. Such review shall be completed within thirty days after
      receipt  of  such scope or design. Each board shall give adequate public
      notice of its meetings and hearings and shall  make  such  meetings  and

      requested by the board.
        i. Each community board may create committees on matters  relating  to
      its  duties  and  responsibilities.  It  may  include on such committees
      persons with a residence or significant interest in  the  community  who
      are  not  members  of  the  board,  but each such committee shall have a
      member of the board as its chairperson. Except as otherwise provided  by
      law, meetings of such committees shall be open to the public.
