* By the same respondent of the same provision of law, order, rule or regulation and, if the respondent is the owner, agent, lessee or other person in control of the premises with respect to which the violation occurred, at the same premises (all violations committed within two years).

Each day during which such violation continues shall constitute a separate violation. The board may remit, in whole or in part, such a civil penalty if, at the conclusion of the hearing or at the time of the board determination under section 24-266 of this code, the respondent is no longer in violation of a provision of this code, or of any order, rule or regulation promulgated by the commissioner or the board;

   (6) Impose a civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars on any owner of a device for each day such equipment is sealed pursuant to this section;

   (7) Impose a civil penalty of not less than one thousand nor more than four thousand dollars on any person who willfully breaks, or causes or permits the breaking of, a seal placed on a device pursuant to this section.

   (8) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of twenty-five percent of that which would otherwise be imposed for each twelve decibels by which the sound or noise level measured exceeds the maximum sound level as contained in subchapters five and six of this chapter.

   (9) Impose an additional civil penalty in the amount of ten percent of the penalty orginally imposed, for late payment of penalty for each month, or part thereof, that the penalty payment is in arrears. In no event shall the total additional civil penalty exceed the maximum set forth in the table of civil penalties, or as modified pursuant to paragraph eight of this subdivision or paragraph ten of this subdivision, or both.

   (10) Order any person to be classified as a persistent violator if such person is found to be in violation of this code and has also on one or more prior occasions within the preceding five years been found to be in violation of this code, where such repeated violations evidence substanial* disregard thereof. If a person is classified as a persistent violator, the board shall in each instance double the amount of the penalty which it would otherwise impose pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision. Such double penalties shall be imposed for violations which the board finds a person committed pursuant to the same proceeding at which it classified such person as a persistent violator and for all violations committed within two years immediately following such classification, after whcih such classification shall terminate. However, if at the end of such two year period such person is still in violation of this code because of a failure to take or complete a corrective action as required by the board, such classification shall continue until such time as such person is no longer in violation of this code because of such failure, at which time such classification shall cease. Thereafter, the board may again classify such person as a persistent violator, on the same basis it used originally.

(c) The board may, upon notice pursuant to section 24-259 of this code:

   (1) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of any listed device without a certificate as required by section 24-245 of this code and the board may also seal such device;

   (2) order any person to cease and desist from tunneling without a tunneling permit as required by section 24-245 of this code and the board may also seal any device used in such tunneling;

   (3) order any person not in possession of an after hours work authorization issued pursuant to section 24-223 of this code to cease and desist from construction activities other than during the permissible hours specified in section 24-222 of this code and the board may also seal any device used in such construction activities;

   (4) order any person to cease and desist from the operation of a device without registration required by section 24-208 of this code and the board may also seal such device.

(d) The board may order the commissioner to install any apparatus or to repair or alter any device or apparatus which causes or is maintained or operated so as to cause a violation of an order issued pursuant to paragraph two of subdivision (b) of this section, where such repairing or alteration can reasonably be expected to correct such a violation. Any work required under such an order may be executed by the commissioner through the officers, agents or contractors of the department. The department shall be reimbursed promptly for all costs and expenses of such work by the owner of the device to which the order relates and in respect to which such expenses were incurred. Such expenses may be recovered in a civil action brought in the name of the commissioner.

(e) If an order of the board issued pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section provides for a period of time during which a person subject to the order is permitted to correct a violation, the board may require the respondent to post a performance bond or other security with the department in a form and amount sufficient to assure the correction of such violation within the prescribed time. In the event of a failure to meet the schedule prescribed by the board, the sum named in the bond or other security shall be forfeited and shall be paid to the commissioner.

(f) (1) The board may order any person to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes causes unreasonable noise which creates imminent peril to the public health and well being, or to cease and desist from an activity which it reasonably believes constitutes a willful or continued violation of any provision of this code or order or regulation, promulgated by the commissioner or board. Such order shall be effective upon service thereof. Any party affected by such an order may request a hearing on written notice, and he or she shall be afforded a hearing, within twenty-four hours after service of such request, pursuant to section 24-263 of this code. If such an accelerated hearing is not requested, then a hearing shall be afforded within ten days of the issuance of the order. The board shall issue its final decision and order thereon within three days from the conclusion of a hearing held pursuant to this subdivision.

(g) The default penalty imposed pursuant to paragraph 5 of subdivision (b) of this section for a violation of section 24-218(a), as set forth in section 3-115 of title 48 of the rules of the city of New York or any successor provision, shall not exceed 150 percent of the scheduled penalty set forth therein.

(c) No person shall cause or permit a building or its appurtenances or a road to be constructed, altered or repaired without taking such precautions as may be ordered by the commissioner or as established by the rules of the department to prevent dust from becoming air-borne.

(d) No person shall cause or permit any use, as defined by section 12-10 of the zoning resolution of the city of New York, to be implemented or maintained without taking reasonable precautions as established by the rules of the department, including, but not limited to, planting or covering, to prevent dust from becoming air-borne.

(e) No person shall cause or permit the spraying of any insulating material, not otherwise prohibited by this code, in or upon any building or other structure during its construction, alteration or repair, unless he or she complies with the rules of the department regarding precautions for the spraying of insulating material.

(f) No person shall cause or permit a building or other structure to be demolished, unless he or she complies with the following precautions:

   (1) Demolition by toppling of walls shall not occur except when approved by the commissioner pursuant to section 24-109 of this code, or when conducted by or on behalf of a city agency pursuant to chapter one of title seventeen of the code or pursuant to an order issued by the department of buildings under article two hundred fifteen of chapter two of title twenty-eight of the code.

   (2) Before the demolition of any section of wall, floor, roof, or other structure, necessary wetting procedures to lay the dust or other precautions to prevent dust from becoming air-borne, as set forth in this section and the rules of the department, shall be employed. All debris shall be thoroughly wetted before loading and while dumping into trucks, other vehicles or containers. In all cases and at all stages of demolition, wetting procedures shall be adequate to lay the dust. Trucks shall be adequately covered or enclosed to prevent dust dispersion while in transit to point of disposal.

   (3) No structural members shall be dropped or thrown from any floor but shall be carefully lowered to ground level.

   (4) Debris shall not be dropped or thrown outside the exterior walls of the building from any floor to any floor below. In buildings twelve stories or greater in height any debris transported outside the exterior walls of the building shall be transported from the upper floors via enclosed, dust-tight chutes or via buckets or other containers. Where chutes or shaftways are used either inside or outside the building, a water soaking spray shall be employed to saturate the debris before it reaches the point of discharge from the chute or shaftway. Where buckets or other containers are used, the debris shall be adequately wetted to preclude dust dispersion when buckets or other containers are dumped.

   (5) (i) In the event particulate matter becomes airborne for a continuous period of fifteen minutes, despite the application of the procedures set forth in this section and the rules of the department, or because freezing temperatures preclude the use of water for laying the demolition dust, the work of demolition shall cease at once until other adequate measures can be taken and procedures shall be evaluated by the commissioner before initiation thereof, provided, however, that if the demolition work is being conducted by or on behalf of a city agency pursuant to chapter one of title seventeen of the code or pursuant to an order issued by the department of buildings under article two hundred fifteen of chapter two of title twenty-eight of the code and freezing temperatures preclude the use of water, then the demolition work may continue as long as necessary to complete the demolition process.

      (ii) An abatement order may be issued by the commissioner, or his or her authorized representative, at any time when it is found that work is being performed in violation of the provisions of this section, or any rules promulgated thereunder, and such work poses a threat to human health and safety. Upon issuance of an abatement order, the activity giving rise to the violation shall immediately stop unless otherwise specified. Such order may be given orally or in writing to the owner, lessee or occupant of the property involved, or to the agent of any of them, or to the person or persons performing the work. Except as provided in subparagraph (iii), a verbal order shall be followed promptly by a written order and shall include the reason for the issuance of an abatement order. The order may require all such work to be done as may be necessary, in the opinion of the commissioner, to remove the danger therefrom.

      (iii) An abatement order issued pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may be appealed in accordance with the rules of the department, and the commissioner shall provide notice and an opportunity to be heard within fourteen days of the filing of such appeal. An abatement order shall be lifted if, upon appeal, the commissioner determines that the issuance of such order was not proper, or upon the submission of proof satisfactory to the commissioner that the requirements of such order have been satisfied. In the case of a verbal abatement order, if the commissioner determines that the condition that gave rise to the order has been immediately corrected, such order shall be lifted at once and shall not be followed by a written order.

The commissioner of transportation shall have full authority to compel all companies operating electric wires to use the subway prepared in accordance with the provisions of sections 24-407 through 24-409 of the code.

b. Wherever, along the streets, in sparsely inhabited or unoccupied portions of such boroughs, the public interests do not require the electrical conductors to be placed underground, and wherever, in any other locality in such boroughs, it is deemed by such commissioner to be, for any cause, impracticable to construct and successfully operate underground the electrical conductors required by any such company, then, it shall be the duty of such commissioner to examine and grant the application of any such company for permission to deviate from such underground system. The commissioner of transportation shall not, however, grant any such permission unless he or she shall be satisfied, upon investigation, that such a permit should be granted for one of the reasons stated above, and that it will not interfere with the successful working of underground conductors elsewhere in such boroughs. Any such permit shall be held and construed to authorize the construction and maintenance of the lines of conductors therein provided for, as and where prescribed by the commissioner of transportation.

c. It is hereby made the duty of such commissioner of transportation, in granting any such permit for other than underground electrical connections, to bear in mind the policy and purpose of sections 24-407 through 24-409 of the code, which is to convert the overhead systems of electrical wires and cables now in use in such boroughs to underground systems, as soon as possible, without impairing the efficiency of their service, and to require that, as far as practicable, all electrical conductors in any street in such boroughs shall be removed from the surface and placed and operated underground, as soon as may be consistent with the convenient use thereof by the public. It is intended to authorize other than underground electrical conductors, to be used in the streets, only when and where the public interests do not require the electrical conductors to be placed underground, or when and where it shall be deemed by the board of estimate to be impracticable to place and operate the conductors advantageously underground. It is also intended to make all aerial or other electrical connections merely incidental to such underground methods, and to require that they be authorized only when and where needed for the convenient use of the public or where the underground conductors can be made more useful thereby.

d. The work of constructing every line of conductors authorized by any such permit, so granted, shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the commissioner of transportation. Every such permit shall specify the location of the structures to be erected and to be used for sustaining the electrical conductors, and shall give the general dimensions thereof.

e. It shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to require that the subway may be used by the city for the electric wires or conductors operated by its police, fire or other agencies without expense, except that of the wires or conductors. The city shall not, however, be compelled to place any such wires or conductors underground until the money has been specifically raised therefor, and until that time the city may continue to use and extend such wires.






*§ 24-409 Aerial electrical wires or cables; regulation.* ::


Whenever the commissioner of transportation shall permit any aerial electrical wires or cables, carried along or across and above the surface of any of the streets of such boroughs, to be crossed by aerial electrical wires or cables, it shall be the duty of the commissioner of transportation to designate also, in such permit, the route and location thereof, and to prescribe and regulate the height at which such wires or cables shall be placed. Whenever any such permit shall be granted by the commissioner of transportation, in extending the connections of any subterranean electrical conductors, for the erection of any structure or structures for sustaining electrical conductors above the surface of any street, or for placing wires or cables on any such structure or elsewhere than underground, or for carrying any such wires or cables across or along and above the surface of any street, or for placing wires or cables on any such structure or elsewhere than underground, or for carrying any such wires or cables over or into or in the rear of any building in such boroughs, any and all such structures, and any and all such wires or cables, shall be so erected and maintained as not to interfere with the other public uses of such streets.






*§ 24-410 Construction of conduits; removal of poles, wires.* ::


Whenever, in the opinion of the commissioner of transportation, a sufficient construction of conduits or subways under ground shall be made ready under the provisions of sections 24-410 through 24-414 of the code, in any street or locality in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx, reference being had to the general direction and vicinity of the electrical conductors then in use overhead, the commissioner of transportation shall notify the owners or operators of the electrical conductors above ground in such street or locality. The notice shall inform them that they are to make such electrical connections in such street or through other streets, localities or parts of such boroughs with such underground conduits or subways as shall be determined by such commissioner of transportation, and to remove poles, wires, or other electrical conductors above ground and their supporting fixtures or other devices from such street and locality within ninety days after notice to such effect shall be given.






*§ 24-411 Removal of abandoned poles.* ::


a. All telegraph, telephone and electric light poles, wires or conductors which shall hereafter remain or stand disused, or become disused or abandoned, in, or over or upon any street, shall be forthwith removed, but for sufficient cause shown the commissioner of transportation may extend the time for such removal, by one or more orders, for periods not exceeding one year each.

b. The persons owning, operating, managing or controlling poles, wires or appurtenances which may have been so disused or abandoned, or which may be dangerous or unsafe, shall take down and remove them, and upon their failure to do so, the commissioner of transportation shall remove the same forthwith, at the expense of such persons. Before such removal, the commissioner of transportation, except where a condition of danger exists, shall mail a notice thereof to the last known address of such persons, a copy of which shall be posted for a period of ten days on each of such poles prior to its removal.

c. Any person convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punished by a fine of not less than $350 nor more than $750 dollars, imprisonment for not more than ten days, or both. In addition to or as an alternative to such penalty, such person shall also be subject to a civil penalty of no less than nor more than $100 per day such person is in violation of any provision of this section. Such civil penalties shall be imposed in the manner set forth in section 19-150.

Such contracts and agreements shall contain such conditions, provisions and stipulations as such board may consider necessary and proper in the interests of the city, and shall be upon such terms as it deems best. Such board, by such contract, may authorize such corporation to lay down pipes and erect hydrants in the streets of the city, under such restrictions and conditions as may be prescribed by such board.

b. Such contracts or agreements may also provide for the purchase by the city of all the rights and property secured by such corporation and the works constructed by them for furnishing water for such special purposes, when such board of estimate shall deem such purchase to be for the interest of the city. Such purchase, however, must be determined upon by such board at the expiration of five years from the date of the contract. The cost of such purchase shall be determined by arbitrators appointed by the supreme court.

The city may grant permits to boat owners for the use of boats on such lakes and reservoirs, and may prescribe rules and regulations for their proper use.

b. If any emergency shall have been declared to exist by the governor in the manner hereinafter provided in subdivision c of this section or in the event of a declaration of war by or against the United States of America, the mayor, for the duration of such emergency or of such war, may revoke, in whole or in part, the privileges set forth in subdivision a hereof and prohibit the use by the public of the lakes and reservoirs of the city. The commissioner may make reasonable rules and regulations as to the use of such reservoirs during such emergency or war period. Any such order of revocation shall define the terms and extent of revocation, and shall state the date on which it shall become effective. Any rules and regulations promulgated by the commissioner of environmental protection during such emergency shall be published once in a newspaper circulating in each of the counties in which the water supply property to be affected thereby shall be located.

The department of environmental protection shall file in the office of the sheriff of each such county a certificate of appointment of each such designated employee, and shall attach to each such certificate a complete copy of the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to subdivisions a and b of this section. Copies of all amendments of such rules and regulations shall be filed by the commissioner with each such sheriff. The sheriff of any such county may cancel any such certificate for cause, and forthwith shall mail written notice of such cancellation to the department of environmental protection, specifying the cause of such revocation. Immediately upon any such cancellation, the employee whose certificate shall have been cancelled, shall have no further authority to act as a peace officer. Each employee so appointed at all times when on duty, shall have in his or her possession a shield or other suitable badge of authority which he or she shall exhibit at once to any person upon request.

e. It shall be the special duty of the employees so appointed to prevent breaches of the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest and bring before the proper judicial officer any person guilty of violating any of such rules and regulations.

f. Any person convicted of violating any of the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to subdivision a of this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than ten dollars for the first offense, twenty dollars or ten days imprisonment, or both, for the second offense, or fifty dollars or fifty days imprisonment, or both, for the third or any subsequent offense.

In the county of Nassau, however, it shall be lawful to do so with the written consent of the state department of health and the commissioner of environmental protection upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by such commissioner. This section shall not, however, be construed to prevent burials in any cemetery already established, or grounds now held by any religious corporation or society organized under the laws of this state.






*§ 24-330 Watering horses.* ::


a. Within the city, all publicly owned watering troughs, and those erected or maintained by the American Society for the prevention of cruelty to animals, shall be provided with the necessary piping and fixtures to enable the filling of pails with water therefrom, or otherwise modified in construction so as to meet the requirements of the board of health. The supply of water for such troughs shall be furnished by the department of environmental protection. All other horse-watering troughs on streets and public places in the city shall likewise be provided with the piping and fixtures necessary to enable the filling of pails with water, and the use of the water for that purpose shall be paid for.

When authorized thereto by resolution of the board of estimate or by local law, the commissioner may install such meters in any or all other multiple dwellings, and he or she shall install such meter or meters or cause them to be installed upon written demand of the owner of any lot or premises to which such water is supplied.

   (2) For purposes of this subdivision an improvement or alteration is a physical change in an existing structure, other than painting, ordinary repairs and normal replacement of maintenance items. A structure shall be deemed to have been substantially improved or altered where:

      (a) the cost of improvement or alteration exceeds the sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars; or

      (b) fifty percent or more of the dwelling units or square feet of the structure in multiple dwellings are improved or altered and the cost of such improvement or alteration exceeds the sum of fifteen thousand dollars per dwelling unit; or

      (c) there has been a conversion in the use of the structure.

b. Thereafter, as shall be determined by the commissioner, the department shall make out all charges for water furnished by such department to such premises in ratable proportion to the water furnished, as ascertained by meter, subject to such minimum and service charges as may be established. All expense and cost of meters, and their connections, and of their setting, repair and maintenance, unless with the approval of the board of estimate such expense and cost be borne by the department, shall be a charge and lien upon the premises.

c. This section shall not, however, be construed so as to remit or prevent the due collection of arrearages or charges for water consumption heretofore incurred, nor interfere with the proper liens therefor, nor of charges, or rates, or liens hereafter to be incurred for water consumption in any building or place which may not contain one of the meters aforesaid. The moneys collected for service charges and for expense and cost of meters and their connections, and for setting, repairing, maintaining and replacing the same, may be applied by the commissioner to the payment of expenses incurred in procuring meters and their connections and in their setting, repair, maintenance and replacement.






*§ 24-335 Charges where supply is metered.* ::


No charge for the supply of water other than a meter charge, minimum charge or annual service charge shall be made against any houses or lots or any portion or portions thereof where a water meter may have been or shall be placed. In all cases where a water meter may have been or shall be placed, the charge for supply of water shall be determined only by the quantity of water actually used, as shown by such meters, except for a minimum charge or an annual service charge and except as provided by subdivision four of section seven hundred thirty-four of the charter.*






*§ 24-336 Acquisition of water meters.* ::


The commissioner may acquire any water meters installed upon premises connected with the public water supply, from private owners, with the approval of the mayor, upon such terms and subject to such rules and regulations as the mayor may approve.

a. It shall be unlawful for water to be wasted, whether owing to leak or wasteful condition, regardless of fault, from any water pipe, valve, faucet, conduit, equipment, facility or device connected to the city water system or which utilizes city water. It shall be the duty of an owner, lessee, agent, manager, operator and of any other person in charge of or who has control over any premises, plant, equipment, facility, device or operation to make frequent regular inspections so as to minimize the likelihood of leak or waste and within a reasonable time after the discovery or notification of any leak or wasteful condition to effect repairs or take other appropriate corrective action within the power of such person. The commissioner of environmental protection shall promulgate such reasonable rules and regulations as the commissioner may from time to time deem appropriate for the prevention of the waste of water.

b. In addition to enforcement pursuant to section 24-346 the commissioner may serve a leak and waste notice upon any person having a duty to repair or correct a leak or wasteful condition or upon any person in violation of the rules and regulations for the prevention of the waste of water. Such notice shall specify the repair or correction to be made and shall fix a reasonable time for compliance. Where such notice has been served and water continues to be wasted after the time for correction has expired, the commissioner may, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the commissioner or his or her designee, turn off the water supply to the premises or impose a penalty not to exceed fifty dollars per day for each day that water continues to be wasted after the expiration date contained in the notice, or both. Any penalty imposed pursuant to this section may be added to the water rents; except that no such penalty may be imposed against any property unless both the leak and waste notice and notice of the proceeding to impose the penalty was served upon the owner by mailing copies thereof to the person whose name appears on the records in the office of the city collector as being the owner or agent or as the person designated by the owner to receive tax bills at the address on file for such purpose or where no name appears to the property addressed to "owner" or "agent" and such person has had an opportunity to be heard. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be construed to limit the commissioner's power to shut off water supply without notice, or with such notice as the commissioner may deem practicable, where a leak exists; or where emergency action is otherwise deemed essential.

c. The department shall establish or reestablish a permanent committee on water conservation (the "committee") within six months of the effective date of this section consisting of outside experts, representatives of public interest, environmental and professional groups and interested citizens, two of whom shall be appointed by the city council and the rest shall be appointed by the commissioner. The members of the committee shall serve without compensation for a term of three years. The commissioner shall be the chairman.

d. Within one year after the effective date of this section, and annually thereafter, the committee shall submit to the city council a report evaluating the effectiveness of paragraphs a through e, of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of RS 16 describing the latest available water-conserving fixtures, and including written recommendations. The department shall make available to the committee any and all information useful and necessary for the committee to prepare and complete the report for submission to the city council. To prepare such report the committee shall utilize any information and/or materials determined to be pertinent that have been published, distributed or in any other manner made available from state agencies, public and private research groups, multistate agencies such as the Delaware River Basin Commission, and other similar public or private agencies or groups with expertise with respect to water-conserving plumbing fixtures. The report shall include, but not be limited to:

   (1) a review of compliance with paragraphs a through e, of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16 of the appendix to chapter one of title twenty-seven of this code, the impact of such compliance, and the relationship of the standards set forth herein to current technology;

   (2) recommendations as to the feasibility of requiring more stringent water-saving performance standards than provided in paragraphs a through e of subdivision P.104.2 of section P.104.0 of reference standard RS 16.

e. The department shall establish a city-wide comprehensive public information campaign focusing on water-conserving fixtures, the benefits of good water-saving equipment, and the opportunity for rapid pay-back and long-term money savings, especially in energy costs, for home owners and landlords. Within six months after the effective date of this section, a proposal for the public information campaign shall be submitted to the city council for review and commentary. The department shall report annually to the city council on the status of the public information campaign.






*§ 24-338 Meters to be installed where water is wasted.* ::

a. In instances where the city has laid a water main in a street where surface grades have been established but where the surface has not been improved to the established grade and when a new water main is installed by the city because it is required by the grading of such street to the established grade, the commissioner of environmental protection shall issue an order directing the owner of each house which was directly connected with the main as previously laid, to transfer the house service pipe connection to the new main, at the expense of such owner when required in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner.

b. When a new water main is installed by the city to replace a private main, the commissioner shall issue an order directing the owner of each house fronting on the city main and receiving water from such private main to transfer the house service pipe connection to the city main, at the expense of such owner and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the commissioner.

c. An order issued pursuant to this section shall be served upon the owner of the premises, by registered mail sent to the address registered by such owner in the bureau of city collections in the department of finance, or if no address is registered in such bureau, by registered mail sent to the last known address of such owner, or to the address of such owner as shown on the records in the office where conveyances of real property are recorded pursuant to law.

d. If the transfer is not made within ten days after the mailing of such order, the department of environmental protection may make such transfer through its officers, agents or contractors. The owner shall be personally liable for the expenses and disbursements incurred by the department in making such transfer. The amount of such expenses and disbursements shall be due and payable when definitely fixed by the commissioner of environmental protection and entered upon the records in the office of the city collector. A notice stating the amount due and the nature of the charge shall be mailed by the city collector within five days after such entry to the address registered by such owner in the bureau of city collections in the department of finance, or if no address is registered in such bureau, to the last known address of the owner of such property or to the address of such owner as shown on the records in the office where conveyances of real property are recorded pursuant to law. If such amount is not paid on or before the last day of the month following the month of entry, it shall be the duty of the city collector to charge, collect and receive interest thereon at the rate of seven per cent per annum to be calculated to the date of payment from the date of entry. The amount of such expenses and disbursements and the interest thereon shall be a lien upon the premises for which the transfer of the house service pipe connection was made, and shall be enforced and collected in the manner provided in chapter three of title eleven of this code for the enforcement and collection of water rents and the lien thereof.

Whenever the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of the provisions of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order, rule or regulation issued by the board or commissioner or in violation of the conditions of any permit issued by the commissioner within the city of New York creates or may create an imminent danger to the water supply or to the water supply system or to the public health or to the life or safety of persons, the commissioner may issue a cease and desist order requiring any person who owns, leases, operates, controls or supervises any building, structure, facility, device, equipment, installation or operation to take such action as may be necessary to halt or prevent such violation.

   2. If service of the order cannot be made personally because such person cannot be located at such time then service may be made by delivering a copy to a person of suitable age and discretion at the residence or place of business of the person sought to be served. If service cannot be made personally or by such delivery to a person of suitable age and discretion because of inability to locate or to obtain the name or address of such person at such time, service may be made by conspicuously posting a copy of such order upon the property to which it relates. The posting of such order shall be sufficient notice of such order to all persons having a duty in relation thereto under the provisions of this subdivision.

   3. If the order is not complied with or so far complied with as the commissioner may regard as reasonable, within the time specified therein the commissioner may act to halt or prevent such violation by:

      (a) sealing, blocking or otherwise inactivating any equipment, facility or device;

      (b) terminating the water supply; or

      (c) any other means or method that is reasonable under the circumstances. For such purpose the commissioner or his or her deputies or such other officers or employees as are designated by the commissioner may enter on any public or private property.

   4. Any person affected by such an order may make written application to the environmental control board for a hearing. Such hearing shall be provided, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the board, and shall be held within forty-eight hours after the receipt of such application. The board may suspend, modify or terminate such order.

f. If the respondent fails to comply with any order issued by the board or commissioner or with the conditions of any permit, or the board or commissioner otherwise deems it necessary, the corporation counsel, acting in the name of the city, may maintain an action or proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or restrain by injunction the violation of any order or permit issued by the board or commissioner.

g. Any person who violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter and chapter four of this title or any order, rule or regulation or with the conditions of any permit issued by the commissioner shall be liable to the city for any expense, loss or damage suffered by the city by reason of such violation.

h. Unless otherwise specifically provided, service of any notice or order may be made either personally or by mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be served.

b. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this subchapter or of any general or special law, the commissioner of environmental protection, during the existence of a state of war between the United States of America and the governments of Germany, Japan and Italy, or any of them, and for six months immediately following the termination thereof, may procure or contract for, without public letting, any equipment or materials necessary for the completion of the Delaware aqueduct and appurtenant structures and for any work to be done in connection with the installation of such equipment or materials if the commissioner certifies that in his or her opinion, it is in the public interest that any such equipment or material be procured or contracted for or any such work be done, without public letting, and any such certificate of the commissioner shall state his or her reasons therefor.

It shall be the duty of the commissioner of environmental protection to provide proper police protection to the inhabitants of the localities in which any work may be constructed under the authority of this subchapter during the period of construction, against the acts or omissions of persons employed on such works or found in their neighborhood. To that end the commissioner is authorized and required to appoint a sufficient number of persons to adequately police such localities for such periods. The commissioner shall also have power to remove such persons and to fix or change their compensation in his or her discretion, which compensation shall be paid by the city upon a certificate of the commissioner, as part of the expense authorized to be incurred by this subchapter.

b. The commissioner of environmental protection shall give to each person so appointed a certificate of appointment and certified copies thereof, one of which shall be filed in the office of the sheriff of each county in which any work shall be in process of construction under this subchapter and in which such person shall be authorized to perform that person's duties. Each person so appointed shall be and have all the powers of a peace officer in the county where any work is being constructed under the authority of this subchapter. Such person shall at all times when on duty wear upon his or her clothing or have in his or her possession a shield or other suitable badge of authority which such person shall at once exhibit to any person asking therefor.

c. It shall be the special duty of the persons so appointed to prevent breaches of the peace and unlawful depredations and to arrest and bring before the proper magistrates persons employed on such works or found in the vicinity thereof, who are guilty of offenses against the law punishable by death, imprisonment or fines, or persons whom they may have reasonable cause to believe to be guilty of such offenses.

d. The sheriff of a county wherein a certificate of appointment of any such person as a peace officer is filed may cancel such certificate for cause, and shall immediately give notice in writing of such cancellation to the commissioner of environmental protection, specifying the cause of such revocation. Such notice may be given by mail. On such cancellation the authority of such person as a peace officer shall immediately cease.

e.

*§ 24-356 Construction and repair of highways and bridges; rules and regulations to prevent improper use.* ::


a. The city is hereby required to build and construct such highways and bridges as may be made necessary by the construction of any reservoir under this subchapter, and to repair and forever maintain such additional highways and bridges and to remove the snow and to sand the highway surfaces whenever necessary, except such as shall be part of any state route; and in case any bridge or highway thus constructed shall cross any railroad, it shall do so above or below such railroad and not upon the same level. The plans and specifications for any highways required to be constructed under the provisions of this section shall be approved by the state department of transportation.

b. The commissioner of environmental protection shall make such reasonable rules and regulations, not in conflict with the highway law, as may be necessary to prevent improper and destructive use of highways and bridges constructed under the provisions of the water supply laws of the city of New York. Provided, however, that the commissioner of environmental protection shall have no greater authority in respect thereto than is now, or may hereafter be, vested by the highway law of the state of New York in the town, county or state authorities in relation to the construction and regulation of town, county and state highways. Any individual or corporation failing to observe such rules and regulations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, in addition, shall be liable for actual damages to such highways and bridges, to be recovered by the city.

c. The state commissioner of transportation, in his or her discretion, shall have the power to perform, at the request of the commissioner of environmental protection and at the expense of the city, any work of original construction of substituting routes required to be performed by the city pursuant to this section. Whenever the state commissioner of transportation shall grant such a request of the commissioner of environmental protection, he or she shall prepare and submit to such commissioner of environmental protection for his or her approval an estimate of the cost of performing such work. Such estimate of cost shall be an estimate of the cost of performing such work of construction pursuant to plans, designs and specifications prepared by the commissioner of environmental protection and approved by the state commissioner of transportation, and shall include all costs in connection with performing such work, including the costs of engineering, auditing and administration. Upon approval of such estimate by the commissioner of environmental protection, the city shall thereupon deposit with the state comptroller, who is authorized to receive and accept the same, for the purpose of this subdivision, a sum of money equal to such estimate, which shall be subject to the draft or requisition of the state commissioner of transportation and a copy of the resolution of such commissioner of environmental protection authorizing such deposit shall be filed with the state commissioner of transportation and with the state comptroller. If, at any time prior to the award of a contract for the performance of such work or prior to the state commissioner of transportation becoming obligated to award such a contract, it appears to such commissioner of environmental protection that the state commissioner of transportation, for any reason, will be unable to award a contract for the performance of such work or that it is undesirable that such a contract be awarded, any sum or sums so deposited by the city, less the amount of cost which the state commissioner of transportation has already incurred, if any, shall be refunded to the city by the state comptroller upon demand of such commissioner of environmental protection made to the state comptroller and to the state commissioner of transportation. The performance of any such work of construction shall be by contract, to be let, so far as practicable, in the manner provided by section thirty-eight of the highway law, which section shall, so far as practicable, apply to contracts hereunder and payments thereon. Such contract shall be subject to and in conformity with such plans, designs and specifications of the commissioner of environmental protection. No contract shall be executed for any such work until satisfactory proof has been furnished to the state commissioner of transportation that the city has made available any real property required and any easements deemed necessary. When work performed by the state commissioner of transportation hereunder has been completed and the cost thereof paid, the state commissioner of transportation shall render to the commissioner of environmental protection an itemized statement showing in full (a) the amount of money which has been deposited by the city with the state comptroller in connection with such work, and (b) all disbursements made by the state commissioner of transportation in connection with the performance of such work. Any surplus money shall be paid to the city upon the warrant of the state comptroller upon vouchers therefor approved by the state commissioner of transportation.






*§ 24-357 Report to comptroller of expenses and liabilities.* ::


The commissioner of environmental protection shall in every calendar month file in the office of the comptroller an account of any expenses made by the commissioner, or under the commissioner's authority, and of all liabilities incurred by the commissioner during the preceding month and an abstract of each such account shall be published in the City Record.






*§ 24-358 Removal of buildings to prevent contamination of the water supply.* ::


The city or its representatives shall not enter upon any lands not taken in pursuance of subchapter three-A of chapter three of title five for the purpose of preserving streams or watercourses from pollution or contamination, or of moving or causing to be moved any buildings, improvements or edifices on the ground that the same may contaminate the water supply, without making a provision for just compensation to the owner of such buildings or improvements for the removal or destruction thereof.






*§ 24-359 Rights of fishing and ice cutting in lakes and reservoirs preserved; regulation.* ::


Nothing herein contained shall authorize or empower the city to prohibit the public from using such lakes or reservoirs that may be constructed under the provisions of this subchapter, for the purpose of ice-cutting or fishing; and the city, or its representatives, shall not hereafter prohibit the public from using such lakes or reservoirs which are now under the care or supervision of the city for the purposes of ice-cutting or fishing, subject, however, to reasonable rules and regulations, and subject however, to the right of the city to prohibit such use in the event of the declaration of an emergency as provided in section 24-326 of this code.

*§ 24-365 Cemetery and burial grounds.* ::


Whenever for the purposes of this subchapter it shall be necessary to use any land or premises, or any portion thereof, now occupied by graves, burial places, cemeteries or other places of interment of human remains, such graves, burial places, cemeteries or other places of interment of human remains and the human remains located therein, shall be removed and disposed of in the following manner:

1. The city having acquired title to the land where burial places are situated shall cause a notice to be published once in each week for four successive weeks in two newspapers published in the county where such burial place or places are situated, which such notice shall be substantially as follows: "Please take notice that the undersigned hereby intends to make application relating to the removal of all the remains, all the monuments and all other distinguishing marks from the cemetery or burial place located in the town of __________________ county of ____________ known as ____________ not less than sixty days after (the last publication date of this notice) for an order pursuant to subchapter four of chapter three of title twenty-four of the administrative code of the city of New York; Please take further notice that any and all person or persons legally entitled to direct as to the disposition of the above may remove the same to any other cemetery or burial place within the same or an adjoining county within sixty days after (the last publication date of this notice) if they so elect upon informing the commissioner of environmental protection in writing of the cemetery or burial place in which said remains are to be reinterred and to which the monuments and other distinguishing marks are to be moved.

______________________________________

Corporation counsel of the city of New York."

2. Not less than sixty days after the last publication date of said notice, the corporation counsel shall make an application to a special term of the supreme court in the same judicial district in which the cemetery or burial place is located for an order authorizing such removal of said remains, monuments and all other distinguishing marks to a cemetery or burial place in the same or an adjoining county from that in which said cemetery or burial place is located. Such order shall be made upon due proof of not less than ten days' notice to interested parties who have appeared by attorney, or who have filed appearances in writing with the corporation counsel, and of proof of publication of notice of such application once in each week for four weeks in each of two newspapers published in the county where such cemetery or burial place is situated, immediately prior to application to the supreme court. Such notice shall briefly set forth the time and place of the making of such application and a designation of the cemetery or burial place to which said remains, monuments and distinguishing marks are sought to be removed. All removals and transportation of such human remains shall be done in accordance with the provisions of the public health law and the local rules or ordinances of any town, city or village wherein such cemetery or burial place is located, or wherein any of such remains may be interred. The commissioner of environmental protection on behalf of the city may acquire by purchase such other lands as may be necessary within the county where such cemetery or burial place is located, or in an adjoining county, for the purpose of properly interring such removed remains, which lands shall be acquired with the approval of the supreme court in the same judicial district as that in which the condemnation proceedings were originally instituted. In the acquisition of such lands no cemetery or burial place shall be divided and the acreage acquired must be at least substantially equal to the acreage taken. The commissioner of environmental protection on behalf of the city may also acquire other lands within the county wherein such cemetery or burial place is located, or in an adjoining county, for the purpose of properly interring and removing such remains, in the same manner as provided by this subchapter for the acquisition of water supply and other lands but such acquisition of such lands shall be subject to approval of the supreme court. No lands shall be acquired within the corporate limits of a village or city except within the bounds of an existing cemetery unless by consent of the board of trustees of the village or common council of the city or other authorities within such village or city occupying similar positions as trustees or aldermen, respectively. The supreme court, upon application for the confirmation of the report of the commissioners, shall make inquiry as to the rights of individual lot owners in cemeteries and provide for the protection of such rights as justice shall require. All the bodies removed by said commissioner of environmental protection shall, when distinguishable, be encased each in a separate box or coffin, and each monument, head stone, foot stone, slab, board or other designating or distinguishing mark shall be properly removed and reset at the grave of each body at the time of such reinterment. Members of the same family shall be reinterred in contiguous graves. Whenever any person or persons, legally entitled to direct as to the disposition of any human remains now interred in a cemetery or burial place, shall request, in writing, within the sixty day period aforesaid, the burial of such remains in a cemetery in the same or an adjoining county, the commissioner shall cause such remains to be reinterred where requested within the same county or in adjoining county, and shall carefully and properly remove such remains to such burial plot and properly reinter the same, and in the event that any human remains be removed to, and reinterred in any other place other than that acquired as herein provided, no portion of the expense for the acquisition of any other grave, graves, or other place or places of burial shall be borne by the city, but in such event the city shall bear only the expense of removal and transportation of such remains.

*§ 24-514 Sewer rents.* ::


a. Sewer system, defined. As used in this section the term "sewer system" shall mean and include the sewers, manholes, intercepting sewers, sewage pumping, treatment and disposal works, and any other plants, works or equipment and accessories within the city, which are used or useful in connection with the collection, treatment or disposal of sewage and waste, and which are owned, operated or maintained by the city as part of the public sewer system.

b. Imposition and computation of sewer rent or charge.

   1. In addition to any other fees or charges provided by law, the owner of any parcel of real property connected with the sewer system, including but not limited to real property connected with the sewer system by means of a private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system, shall pay a sewer rent or charge for the use of the sewer system. Such rent or charge shall be based on the water supplied to any such real property as measured by the amount charged for such water, except as otherwise provided by this section. Such rent or charge shall be computed by the commissioner of environmental protection in accordance with the provisions of this section.

   2. For any such property supplied with water from the municipal water supply system the sewer rent or charge shall be equal in amount to sixty percent of the charges for water supplied to such property from such system.

   3. For any such property supplied with water by a private water company, the commissioner of environmental protection shall, by rule and regulation, subject to the approval of the board of estimate, fix the fraction of the charges for such water, which shall constitute the sewer rent for such property, so that the sewer rent or charge for such property shall, as nearly as possible, be equivalent to the sewer rent or charge imposed under paragraph two of this subdivision for property supplied with water from the municipal water supply system.

   4. If any such property is supplied with river water or water from private wells, the sewer rent or charge for such property shall be equal in amount to sixty percent of the amount that would be charged for the quantity of water supplied from such sources if such water were supplied by the city at the rates charged for water supplied to metered premises. The commissioner of environmental protection shall estimate the quantity of water supplied from such sources and shall compute the sewer rent or charge, on the basis of such estimated quantity, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. However, if a water meter, approved by the commissioner of environmental protection, has been or shall be installed by the owner or occupant of the premises to measure the quantity of water supplied from such sources, the quantity of water measured by such meter shall constitute the basis for computing the sewer rent or charge in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. In the event that such property supplied with river water or water from private wells is also supplied with water from the municipal water supply system or by a private water company, the sewer rent or charge for such property shall consist of the rent or charge computed pursuant to this paragraph and the rent or charges computed in accordance with paragraph two or three of this subdivision as the case may be.

   5. The commissioner of environmental protection shall have the power to promulgate rules and regulations, subject to the approval of the board of estimate, prescribing reasonable sewer rents or charges for any such property which is used for an industrial or commercial purpose of such a nature that water supplied to it cannot be entirely discharged into the sewer system. The sewer rent or charges prescribed pursuant to this paragraph shall be based, as far as practicable, upon the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system as estimated by the commissioner of environmental protection, or where an estimate of such amount is impracticable, upon any other basis bearing a reasonable relationship to the amount of sewage discharged into the sewer system.

c. Additional rule making powers. The commissioner of environmental protection shall have the power to make such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Such rules and regulations shall be subject to approval by the board of estimate.

d. Cooperation by private persons, water companies, and public agencies. The commissioner of environmental protection may require every person who owns or occupies real property within the city, every private water company supplying water to property within the city, and all municipal agencies, officers, and employees to furnish him or her with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Every such person, water company, or municipal agency, officer, or employee shall cooperate with the commissioner of environmental protection in carrying out the provisions of this section and shall comply with all rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section. Such commissioner shall have the power to hold such hearings and to subpoena such witnesses and direct the production of such books and papers as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.

e. Exemptions from sewer rents or charges. Any real property which is entitled to an exemption from the payment of water rents or charges shall also be exempt from payment of the sewer rents or charges imposed hereunder.

f. Payment and enforcement of sewer rents or charges. All sewer rents or charges imposed hereunder shall be due and payable at the times and in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of the code. Such rents or charges shall constitute a lien upon the real property served by the sewer system and such lien shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim except the lien of an existing tax, water rent or local assessment. Such rents or charges shall be collected and the liens thereof may be foreclosed in the manner provided in chapters three and four of title eleven of this code.

g. Sewer fund. The revenues derived from the sewer rentals imposed hereunder, including penalties and interest thereon, shall be kept in a separate and distinct fund to be known as the sewer fund. Such fund shall be used for the payment of the cost of the management, maintenance, operation and repair of the sewer system, the cost of administering and enforcing the provisions of this section and the cost of collection of the sewer rents or charges imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section, and any surplus in such fund shall be used for the payment of the interest and amortization on any debt which has been or shall be incurred for the construction of intercepting sewers and sewage treatment and disposal works, and for the enlargement, replacement, or addition of intercepting sewers or sewage treatment works. However, such funds shall not be used for the extension of sewers to serve unsewered areas.

   2. The commissioner shall by rule or regulation adopt the standards, prohibitions and requirements promulgated under the federal water pollution control act, commonly referred to as the clean water act, as amended, except where such standards, prohibitions and requirements are less stringent than those which are established by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph one or three of this subdivision.

   3. Notwithstanding any inconsistent provision of paragraphs one and two of this subdivision, the commissioner may order any person discharging a toxic substance directly or indirectly into the sewer system or into any private sewer or drain emptying into the sewer system to reduce the amount or concentration of such toxic substance to a level which the commissioner determines to be economically achievable by the discharger notwithstanding that such level is lower than that which is prescribed in the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph one or two or that the discharge is not regulated under such provision. Within twenty days after the issuance of an order by the commissioner, any person affected by such order may request a hearing before the commissioner. The commissioner may suspend, revoke or modify the order.

f. Cooperation by private persons, water companies and public agencies. The commissioner may require every person who owns or occupies real property within the city and every private water company supplying water to property within the city, to furnish him or her with such information as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. The commissioner shall have the power to hold hearings and to subpoena any such persons or company, or any officer, employee or agent of any such company, and direct the production of books and papers in order to carry out the provisions of this section.

Any such mortgagee or lienor shall be afforded the same protections against such lien as afforded under law against a judgment lien which arises out of an unsecured obligation and which arises as of the time of the filing of the notice of the lien imposed by this section.

i. (1) In any proceedings to enforce or discharge the lien, the validity of the lien shall not be subject to challenge based on (i) the lawfulness of the response measure implemented; or (ii) the propriety and accuracy of the items of expenses for which a lien is claimed, except as provided in this subdivision.

Chapter 10: Environmental Hazard Remediation.
--------------------------------------------------



*§ 24-1000 Declaration of policy.* ::


It is hereby declared that asthma and other respiratory conditions have increased significantly in the United States and that evidence suggests that indoor environments, where most people spend a majority of their time, play an important role in predisposing vulnerable populations to asthma and other respiratory diseases. The National Academy of Sciences found that there was sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between a number of respiratory conditions and the presence of asthma triggers, irritants, pathogens, fungi and mold, including stachybotrys chartarum, soot from severe smoke or fire damage and flood damage, mold or environmental pathogens including bird or bat droppings or potentially infectious materials as defined by 29 CFR 1910, including H1N1, viruses, bacteria, blood borne pathogens, chemical spills, and sewage. Vulnerable populations such as those with profound immune-suppression, obstructive or cavity lung diseases, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma exacerbated by moldy materials, pneumonitis, are at particular risk. A highly trained workforce with skills across individual hazard and remediation method techniques will help to address multiple and common hazards in a safe manner. Further, in times of crisis, both natural and manmade, profiteers and other unscrupulous persons have historically taken advantage of victims. An approved master environmental hazard remediation technician registration program would result in a uniform standard of training that would allow the citizens of New York city to have confidence that environmental hazard remediation is done efficiently, effectively and safely.

Therefore, the council finds that it is in the best interests of the city to create a voluntary master environmental hazard remediation technician registration program which would recognize those who are sufficiently trained to hold themselves out as a master environmental hazard remediation technician.
