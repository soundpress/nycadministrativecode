h. The commissioner may request the corporation counsel to institute any action or proceeding that may be appropriate or necessary to restrain, correct or abate a violation of the provisions of this chapter.

i. 1. If the commissioner has reasonable cause to believe that an owner, or any employee, agent or independent contractor of such owner, has violated the provisions of this chapter, or any term or condition of a permit issued pursuant thereto, or any rule promulgated by the commissioner pursuant thereto, the commissioner may (i) notify the owner of the condition identified by the commissioner as a violation and specify the action that must be taken to correct the condition in such manner and within such period of time as shall be set forth in such notice, and (ii) shall afford the owner an opportunity to contest the commissioner's notice in a manner to be set forth in rules of the commissioner. Upon final determination by the commissioner and failure of such owner to correct the condition in the manner and within the period of time specified by the commissioner, the commissioner shall be authorized, at his or her discretion:

      aa. to remove or cause the removal of any public pay telephone which is installed, operated or maintained on, over or under any street or other unalienable property of the city without a permit therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, notice shall be provided pursuant to this subdivision prior to removal only where the name and address of the owner is shown on the public pay telephone or can be readily identified by the commissioner by virtue of a trademark prominently displayed on the public pay telephone.

      bb. to revoke a permit and, upon revocation, to further order the removal of the public pay telephone. In the event the permittee fails to remove the public pay telephone and to perform related repair and restoration work within the time period specified by such order, the commissioner may remove or cause the removal of the public pay telephone and have repair and restoration work performed at the expense of the permittee, who shall be liable for the amount expended by the city;

      cc. to render a public pay telephone inoperable except for the purpose of emergency telephone service through the 911 system or an operator. Such action may continue until the violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the commissioner and payment has been made of all civil penalties imposed for the violation and any fees for any administrative expense or expense of additional inspections incurred by the city as a result of such violation. The commissioner shall affix to any public pay phone rendered inoperable pursuant to this paragraph a notice advising the public that the phone may be used only for emergency telephone service through the 911 system or an operator and setting forth the provisions of subdivision h of this section. Any device utilized by the commissioner for the purpose of rendering a public pay telephone inoperable shall be designed so as to permit the unimpaired use of the public pay telephone upon the removal of the device;

      dd. to suspend review of all applications for the issuance or renewal of permits filed by such owner pursuant to this chapter. Such suspension may continue until the violation has been corrected to the satisfaction of the commissioner and payment has been made of all fines or civil penalties imposed for the violation, any costs incurred by the city for removal and related repair or restoration work, and any fees for any administrative expense or expense of additional inspections incurred by the city as a result of such violation.

   2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph one of this subdivision, if the commissioner determines that an imminent threat to life or property exists, the commissioner may remove or cause the removal of a public pay telephone, and have repair and restoration work performed at the expense of the owner, without affording the owner an opportunity to be heard prior to such removal. An owner who is a permittee or whose name and address is shown on the public pay telephone shall be provided notice and an opportunity to be heard five days after such removal in accordance with rules of the commissioner.

   3. The procedures set forth in this subdivision shall be employed by the commissioner in addition to or in lieu of the other remedies set forth in this section and shall not be construed to limit the power of the commissioner to commence a civil action or proceeding before the environmental control board, or to require that the commissioner resort to any procedure set forth in this subdivision as a prerequisite to the commencement of any such action or pro- ceeding.

j. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person: (i) to remove any device installed by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph aa of paragraph one of subdivision g of this section or to otherwise make operable a public pay telephone upon which such a device has been installed; or (ii) to remove or deface any notice affixed to a public pay telephone pursuant to such paragraph of such subdivision. Such misdemeanor shall be punishable upon conviction by a fine of not more than ten thousand dollars or imprisonment for not more than thirty days or both such fine and imprisonment.

k. Any public pay telephone removed pursuant to this section which is not claimed by the owner within thirty days of removal shall be deemed to be abandoned. All abandoned public pay telephones may be sold at public auction after having been advertised in the City Record and the proceeds paid into the general fund or such abandoned telephones may be used or converted for use by the department or by another city agency. A public pay telephone shall be released to the owner upon payment of the costs of removal, repair and restoration work, and of storage, any fees for any administrative expense or expense of additional inspections incurred by the department as a result of the violation, or, if an action or proceeding for the violation is pending in a court or before the environmental control board, upon the posting of a bond or other form of security acceptable to the commissioner in an amount which will secure the payment of such costs and any fines or civil penalties which may be imposed for the violation.
